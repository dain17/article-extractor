They were genetically different enough from humans to be a different species altogether, which is something you would know if you were educated and didn't just regurgitate young earth nonsense from creationists. \n\nSomething else you would know if you were educated would be the fact that the flood is a myth and did not happen. \n\nAnother thing you would know if you understood genetics is that 8 people cannot maintain a genetic line diverse enough to survive, nor can the small numbers of each \"kind\" brought along. Genetics is one of those things that says your ark story is nonsense, and we don't even need genetics to know that.",
