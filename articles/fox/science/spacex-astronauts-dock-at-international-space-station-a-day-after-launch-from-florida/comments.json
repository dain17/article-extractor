Unlike all those \"other\" socialist mainstream conspirators trying to destroy our government  with those conspiracies hatched  by  virtually  every climate scientist on the planet,  the Fox commentators will not find the science and implications of the two most recent US space accomplishments anything to be enthused about.  ‚ÄúInsightful‚Äù commentators  from all other news sources are phony elitists, many from universities that are brainwashing college students  and  trying to be politically correct among the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù  or easily ‚Äútriggered‚Äù feminized gender confused degenerate population. Reading news talk  that mainstream else finds interesting is full of nuance, lengthy paragraphs, big words  and might  be challenging  to understand. To help the typical Fox  commentator  to sound well informed among your own kind  and to feel acceptance and  feel good validation, just read  no further than headlines of the main stream media. Avoid  trying to  commentate about the body of any text or television news other than Fox, One America, or  Breitbart. Here is how to impress your friends and not embarrass yourself. Whatever is top news coming from the news headlines ‚Äúlame stream media‚Äù, avoid reading the wordy text.\nStrut  your Pro Trump stuff by  adding into the conversation something  sophomoric about Clinton, Al Gore, George Soros or the Deep State.",
