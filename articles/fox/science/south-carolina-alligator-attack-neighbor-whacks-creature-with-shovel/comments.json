I do not know for sure, but family dogs playing in the water is one of the main reasons children and adults are taken by gators.

I would be playing with the hair on my legs and sniffing little children and one of those dog faced pony soldier lizards would eat the black boy and I was supposed to do something. I decided to sing my favorite hymn but I couldn't remember the words. I just remembered that it was the former lifeguards fault and I felt better. They tried to make me feel bad because I was looking at my watch when the gators were eating people but the little tail on the mouse goes round and round and it just makes me laugh. I remember when I was the first man to land on the moon but no one ever brings that up. I went there to visit a synagogue and comfort them after they were struck by meteors, they claim I wasn't there but I'm pretty sure my daughter married one of them. I don't remember having a daughter but the magic voice in my head says I have one.  I got a cat once, it was weird man it barked instead of mooing like a cat does. I had to send it away on a prearranged trip because it started biting and attacking people.  It wasn't the cats fault it was the lifeguard before me who is to blame.\nI've got a lot more to say but it's tapioca day and if I hurry I can get a big bowl full and that's no malarkey.",

Alligators are usually wary of humans and only become dangerous if you accidentally get too close to a gator's nest, which usually only happens while fishing. The female will make her presence known so you can move elsewhere.  Small animals, including little children, wandering too close to the waters' edge are definitely in danger. Alligators are itinerant. They roam from one body of water to another, including golf course water hazards, looking for food. If you're around fresh water lakes, rivers, retention ponds, etc. you must assume an alligator is in the water. Adults need not worry but walking a dog by the waters' edge isn't a good idea. And, as with other wild animals, don't feed them! I've had some fun with them while fishing, though. If the fishing is slow and I find a 'gator hiding in the weeds, I'll rig up a buzz bait, toss it over and past its head, drag the buzz bait real fast past the gator's nose and watch the gator snap at it. Good for laughs! Seriously, though, if you have small children you need to keep them a safe distance from the water.",
