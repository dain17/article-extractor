I remember a lot of the old sci-fi movies from the 50s and 60s showing space ships taking off from the Earth and landing back on Earth or on another planet this same way.  So there is some humor that we think we have advanced so incredibly far when we are over 50 years away from those early sci-dreams. I'm not sure we are as advanced as we think we are.
