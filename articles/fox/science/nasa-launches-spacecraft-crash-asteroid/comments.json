Asteroids are dense Usually and mostly made from Planetary space metal and other Cosmic space debris. Almost every one of them is of metal composition. NASA provides a statement that it may be possible as the the asteroid moved off its course a Millimeter. Anybody who has ever held an space asteroid in there hand knows a tiny piece is really heavy. so now we have wasted 330 million taxpayers dollars. We have Lost earth metal to space which is a resource we need here on earth to build cars and stuff, or \nprediction # 2: NASA Delays the launch and keeps delaying it until we all forget they were going to do it. but you know lets do it any ways, for science!",

That topic must be too divisive.\n\nThe shadow of the Earth as it passes in front of the Moon is curved because the Earth is round. Many people graduate high school and they know the Earth is round because that's what they were taught but if you ask them to demonstrate that the Earth is round, they cannot. People 1000 years ago had a clearer idea that the Earth is round the high school graduates have today. Eratosthenes of Alexandria calculated the Earth's circumference to within a 96% accuracy in 250 BC.\n\nYoung people today are told evolution is true but they have no idea if it is or not. They just believe what they're told. They go on to become college graduates and some become professors teaching others what they have been taught but they never question whether it is true or not.\n\nQuestion everything. We know the Earth is round, not because our teachers told us it is but because we can see the shadow of the Earth on the Moon, we can see the North Star change position as we change latitude, we can see ships slowly go below the horizon as they go out to sea and reappear above the horizon as they approach, and lastly, we can see how the shadows cast by the Sun change direction as the Earth rotates and seasons change.\n\nWhat evidence is there for evolution? Do not say \"fossils.\" Fossils are merely evidence that something has died. Question everything. Life is not an accident.",
