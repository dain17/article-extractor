Democrats who think they can change the climate are uneducated hacks. At one time before there was life o Earth, the planet was totally frozen solid and no chance of ever heating up. Then volcanoes started erupting all over and over many years the Earth thawed out. Carbon went into the air. Then we had rain. Then life started. Plants suck up carbon dioxide as easy as we breath air. Without carbon dioxide there is no plant life and no life at all. If people start messing around trying to change the climate they can end up killing all life on Earth. We have to live here.

Moreover, there are SUPERVOLCANOES (2000 deg F) underground much closer to the Earth's surface than before.  \n\nThere is no  way that 4 carbon dioxide molecules per 10,000 air molecules can trap enough heat to compete with all the volcanoes and supervolcanoes around the world.  Moreover, Greenhouse Effect in the atmosphere is dominated by CLOUDS, with HUMIDITY a weaker secondary effect.\n\nOne of the most damaging ways that Al Gore's world leadership for the past few decades has HARMED SCIENCE is that organizations like NASA that used to be true leaders of science are POLITICIZED.  NASA and several other purported science organizations claim that SATELLITES have been measuring carbon dioxide infrared absorption for decades, based on the wavelength range (spectrum) being absorbed.  But the old CRC handbook (starting on page 433) told us BOTH carbon dioxide and water vapor absorb strongly across the infrared spectrum.  The difference is still that there are ONLY 4 carbon dioxide molecules per 10,000 air molecules in the atmosphere.  Given that clouds can block satellite view of the Earth's surface and that the satellite sees more ocean than not when it orbits the Earth, there is NO WAY to eliminate water while isolating the \"dominance\" of carbon dioxide gas.  Those satellites measure infrared absorption of WATER -- liquid, solid and gaseous.",

There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.  \n\nBut before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors.  This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses.  So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves. For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.  You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death.  And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. Yet not even a hair of your head will perish. By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.\"\n\nWe don't know the day or the hour but Jesus told us the seasons and the times.  The majority of true, believing, Bible-fed Christians can see what is happening.  \n\nRepent, make Jesus your Lord and Savior and be saved before it is too late.",
