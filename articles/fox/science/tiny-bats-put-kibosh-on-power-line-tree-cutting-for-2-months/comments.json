Now, of course, if you don‚Äôt believe God and His Word and how He gave the Earth to Man in Genesis 1.26, then these things mean nothing to you. \n\nThe Bible also tells us that this Earth was perfect when it was created but that it was corrupted by the first man‚Äôs sin. The Bible tells us this Earth will be destroyed and replaced with a new Earth. I don't suppose you believe those parts of the Bible, either. In case you hadn't noticed, this Earth has vulcanos and earthquakes and landslides and hurricanes and tornados and hail and many ways of trashing the environment and killing many animals and people. You need to complain to your God about trashing His Earth. You do realize that God has already destroyed everything on the surface of the Earth once before in a great worldwide flood, don't you?\n\nI refer you to 2 Peter 3, especially verses 5 - 7.

Perhaps playing stupid is your defense mechanism when confronted with your own wretchedness and the judgment you are facing, not realizing that God has provide a way for you to walk away from that judgment with a declaration of \"innocent.\" That's too bad for you.\n\nYou can save neither the Earth nor the bats and attempting to do so will not save you. Your Creator offers you salvation for free. Only a fool would choose a bad outcome when he could be saved effortlessly. Stop being a fool.",

The human brain senses what's in the environment surrounding it with the vast majority of those sensations never making it to consciousness. Recognition is a CONSCIOUS process, then the brain must sort out what it recognizes from past experiences, i.e. memory. Didn't you take basic biology or do you just employ creationism to believe some super being gives humans consciousness? Does biological fact make your head explode?\nConsider a set where thousands of already documented elements reside, e.g. gods, of which ONE created the universe. Now that set is not empty and you cannot determine which of those elements created the universe.\nIf you are unable to consider that example, then you have no mental capacity to have a conversation with me. Perhaps you were educated in Trump University; did you get your tuition back after it was closed for fraud? More likely you are not really educated enough to consider other imaginary creations other than your own and pass that off as everyone's reality.

When Jesus Christ returns as King of the Earth, he will restore many things as they were before Man‚Äôs disobedience. Ultimately, this Earth will be destroyed and replaced by a new Earth better even than the first one. \n\nThat is the true narrative.",

I was created in the image of God.\n\nJesus may have been humble on his first visit to Earth but he won't be on his second!\n\n\"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet ... Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.\nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, ‚ÄúFear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.\"\n‚Äì Revelation 1.10 - 19 (ESV)\n\nThere's your humble Jesus. Do your beliefs account for the conquering King Jesus?",
