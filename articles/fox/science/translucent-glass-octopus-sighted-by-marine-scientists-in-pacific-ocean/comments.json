Coming to a comments board and scoffing at someone you don't agree with is not the best use of your time or mental capacity.\n\nLearn the difference between \"evidence\" and \"interpretation of evidence.\" They are not the same.\n\nNo one has ever claimed that the tooth-faery is your creator or controlled your eternal destiny. Your comparison is foolish. Wrong premises lead to wrong conclusions.",
