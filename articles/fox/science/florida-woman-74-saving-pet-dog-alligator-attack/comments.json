People throughout the state lose their animals to gators all of the time since they take their dogs, etc. down to ponds, rivers, lakes, etc.  There should be a law against this kind of stupidity and, moreover, its animal cruelty.  There was a sad story a couple of years ago concerning a young vet that lost his dog to a gator.  He was upset with himself since he definitely knew better (walked him around a lake frequented by Gators);  He was so consumed with sadness, self-loathing that he killed himself over it within 24 hours of losing his dog - obviously his reaction to the loss of his pet was definitely extreme but pet owner's can easily relate to how he felt - he also had PTSD but his dog meant everything to him.  Its a horrible story since this guy was an honorable veteran and he had everything going for him, very upsetting all around.  It should be a cautionary tale for people that live in gator territory.",

I have seen nine foot gators completely hidden with people walking by within three feet of them and not even realizing they were there.  Alligators don't go out of there way to attack people.  They are part of our ecosystem here.  The only alligator attacks come when ignorant people do stupid things.  If you don't like gators, by property on a lake up north.  If you want live here, play by the rules.",
