On the other hand, remember who was President when manned flights were ended and the era of humans as cargo began, including paying the Russians to carry American crew to the International Space Station! The flights were done as if humans were baggage not actual crews like the Shuttle Program! Notice NASA seems uninterested in pilots, humans at the controls ... that's an administrative decision and I'd argue a bad one which I would hope would be reversed, pilots with computers work on airplanes so why not a new push to a new Space Shuttle which is easily refined for flight perhaps even to the Moon?  The return to the Moon should be in more than a pod, a capsule! That's been done before so what happened to all of the knowledge gained during those flights? The value of going to the Moon is as much a quest for knowledge as a means to learn more about the nature of our own Planet, Solar System and guess what Worldwide Climate changes. While this is at least a return it's rather sad that it looks like NASA is just repeating past events and glories while letting the Chinese surpass what used to be an agency to be both proud of and amazed by.",
