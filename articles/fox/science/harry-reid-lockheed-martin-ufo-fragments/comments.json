Although the exact number is unknown, there are about a half-trillion stars in the Milky Way, and likely billions of extraterrestrial planets in \"goldilocks zones\" (i.e., with moderate temperatures for bearing liquid water).  So the mathematical probability of extraterrestrial life is high.\n\nIs there \"intelligent\" extraterrestrial life in the Milky Way galaxy?  Again, undoubtedly yes, based on mathematical probabilities.   But does intelligent life exist on extraterrestrial planets with technologically manageable escape velocities?  Does such life exist in biological orders that homo sapiens would be able to recognize as life forms?   Somewhere, probably yes.\n\nCould extraterrestrial intelligent life navigate the vast interstellar distances?  If you accept that the speed of light is a physical constant (as Albert Einstein did), then this is a huge problem for any life form to overcome.  Most people cannot truly grasp the technology and time involved in traveling these vast, incomprehensible distances through light-years of open space.  Believe whatever you wish, of course.  As a scientist, I find it difficult to accept a significant probability that an intelligent extraterrestrial life form has mastered the technology for manned interstellar travel and applied it to visiting Earth.
