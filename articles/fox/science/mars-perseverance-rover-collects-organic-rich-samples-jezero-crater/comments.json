Certainly their purpose was not to deny reality that is so plainly obvious to those who care to observe the natural world.

Jesus mentions Noah and the flood but gives no indication that it was a parable. Peter is not treating it as a parable. Which one of us is distorting Scripture? You reject the truth of the Word of God. It's just that simple. Do you also think Jesus did not raise the son of the widow in Nain from the dead. Was that a parable? (Luke 7.11 - 17) Did Jesus really raise the daughter of Jairus from the dead or was that a parable? (Luke 8.40 – 56) How about Jesus himself? Did Jesus really rise from the dead or is that another parable? Is the whole Scripture nothing but parables? How exactly do you distinguish between true historical narrative and parable?\n\nJesus mentions the flood:\n\"But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.\"\n– Matthew 24.37 - 39\n\nJesus doesn't sound like he's treating the flood as a parable.",

What's worse is that you blindly took these geological impossibilities at face value without the slightest bit of intellectual curiosity to read more about how sedimentation (not always by water) actually works.\n\nLet's get on to the God questions.\n\"Does your \"loving God\" have the wisdom and power to create the Earth from nothing in a moment by a mere spoken word?\" I don't know, as a mere human I can only understand a fraction of God. But I do think that God would not consider it wise to create that way, because He didn't, and I trust His wisdom.\n\"...  to create 90 billion lightyears of universe filled with stars and galaxies out of nothing in a moment by a mere spoken word? \" That sounds like the Big Bang hypothesis. And I don't know how that would reflect wisdom if it is all for just one tiny little planet with life and humans, as you claim. It would be incredibly wasteful.\n\"If your God doesn't have that kind of power and wisdom then my God is bigger than your God.\" There is only one God, and you sound like  teenage boys comparing the size of their junk.\nThe one God of the universe has His ways, and those are cosmic and biological evolution. I trust His wisdom in using those forms of creation.",

Dolomite is a kind of limestone that formed at the sea floor as products of life of sea organisms being built up over millions of years. Plate tectonics eventually pushed those dolomites up into continents, the evidence of which is seen in rock outcrops around the world.\nWithout going on about world dolomites, some in the walls of the Grand Canyon,  the bedrock at one of my fossil sites, at the edge of the Kalahari desert, is made of dolomite (which does not form above ground). Water tables form within the pre-Cambrian dolomitic limestone, and come out as springs. These springs deposit limestone-laden water as tufa, so once again, life forms rock.\nAt this fossil site, which houses one representative of our ancestors and many ancestors of other living species, one can count thousands of layers of tufa. Tufa, at best, forms one layer a year.\nSo at one site, your young Earth proposal is easily disproven, and your ideas of a global flood are destroyed.\n\nSorry, but scientific facts and the Holy Bible are with me on this one. Genesis 1:2: Now Earth was formless and empty. So abiogenesis happened, How it did By God's hand neither of us knows. But Biblically, abiogenesis happened.",

Without LIFE, your evolutionary theory is dead ... really dead. Can you account for the beginning of life? Did anyone observe the beginning of life? Actually, yes – someone did observe the beginning of life on Earth. The One who created all life observed His own work and has given us His testimony. Was anyone there to witness the supposed beginning of the first cell which supposedly evolved into all the forms of life we see today? There is more support for the creation narrative in Genesis than for your godless version of creation.\n\nDo you really know the words of Jesus? Here are a few more.\n\n\"But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.\"\n– Mark 10.6 (KJV)\n\nGod does not testify that He made them protozoans. Do you believe Jesus or do you reject his words?\n--------------------------------\n\nPlease learn to distinguish between the present and the past. Empirical science addresses things in the present. Your evolutionary theory deals with a past that can only be imagined and cannot be confirmed by any empirical evidence. If you believe the words of Jesus, then accept his testimony about how life began. He was there. He has testified.",

(Let's be clear – \"evolution\" simply means \"change over time.\" Various definitions for \"evolution\" are used by arguers for their own convenience. What we are discussing is Darwinian evolution, which has the idea of a \"last common ancestor\" and that all varieties of life, from oak trees to elephants, descended from one common ancestor. This is foreign to the creation of the various kinds of creatures described in Genesis 1. Even the notion that all mammals or all reptiles or all plants descended from common ancestors is foreign to the creation narrative. There is no ancestral relationship even between dogs and cats, though these two kinds of creatures have many similarities. They were created separately.) Without abiogenesis happening, neither does Darwinian evolution happen, for, without life, there could be no Darwinian evolution. However, to be clear, even with life, there is still no Darwinian evolution. Each of the various kinds of creatures on Earth were created complete and distinct. While, for example, dogs have evolved into many varieties of dogs, all of them are still dogs and they have always been dogs since they were created. Dogs have never been anything other than dogs and have no ancestral relationships with any other creatures.\n\nThe quote from Jesus indicates that God made Man as man, not as some protozoan that evolved into Man.",

Yet up until the 17th century, creationist were convinced the Earth was the center. A great scientist name Giordano Bruno provided mathematical evidence the Earth was not the center. Bruno was told to retract his findings or face tribunal. Bruno refused and the Pope had him burned at the stake for heresy. It was just 20 years later Galileo provided the same evidence. \n\nI stand by my words. It is mathematically impossible Earth harbors the only living organisms in the universe. It's only a matter of time until evidence is produced. And even when the evidence is produced, creationists will dismiss it, just as they did in the 17th century.",
