We can breathe Mars‚Äô air but we would need heating coils to warm it before we inhale. \n\nWe can fly giant mirrors to Mars to focus sunlight on the ice caps and warm the planet up.

Mars is as ‚Äúhabitable‚Äù as the interior of an active volcano.  Don‚Äôt be foolish.  Mars colonization is science fiction.  Let the robots do their work.

Mars atmosphere is 95% CO2, 3% nitrogen but only traces of O2 - hardly enough to support human life (Earth has 21% O2). We could, however, create our own from the ice caps and other ice deposits. But we'd have live in pressurized shelters since Mars' atmospheric pressure is less than 1% of Earth's at sea level. Personally I think underground would be best due to the very high cosmic radiation getting to Mars' surface. Living on the surface without adequate shielding would fry a man in short order.",
