        "context": "It is getting very creepy and potentially dangerous in this modern age of CRISPR \"gene editing\". In most western nations, such genetic manipulation is restricted to non-human experiments. Not so in China, which brought us the weaponized bat virus, known as COVID-19. In the Book of Revelation, the \"kings of the east\" raise up a \"200 million man army\". Some scholars claim that this is not humans but demons. Others say, the army is made of of men. Perhaps, both opinions are correct. Imagine the value to the communist party of China of producing a 200 million large army of \"men\" genetically altered to be larger, tougher, and unquestioningly obedient.",
