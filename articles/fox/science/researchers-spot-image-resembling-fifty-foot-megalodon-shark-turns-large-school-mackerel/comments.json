They still survive because they live in oxygen depleted areas of the Ocean where other predators cannot survive. \nThere is good chance that both Megalodon still exists as well as Plesiosaurs.  Reported sightings of Plesiosaurs in Ocean and large lakes shows they like underwater cave areas. That could indicate they hibernate for long periods there when food supply gets low. \nOn the plesiosaur front one must not also forget the Japanese trawler incident with a rotting carcass that could only been a young plesiosaur.

Science is a rather vague term encompassing a great many fields and methods of research. \"Science\" does not have a mind and does not say anything. Sometimes people like you or I refer to \"science\" as if it said something, but since you and I are so antagonistic to one another, it is necessary that we use words strictly according to their proper meanings.\nLikewise, \"evidence\" does not say anything. People interpret evidence and oftentimes different people interpret the same evidence differently.\nAs usual, you don't know whatTF you're talking about.
