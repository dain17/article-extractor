Yes it is possible that it is traveling away from us so it is theoretically possible that something could be as much as 30 billion light years away BUT.... the light from such a place in the universe will not reach us for possibly billions of years as the light has to travel that ever increasing distance.",

Everything (light, photons, particles, matter) within the fabric of space-time (inertial reference frame) is bound by the speed of light according to special relativity.  But space-time itself follows general relativity which has no inertial reference frame.   The fabric of space-time can travel or expand faster than light.  Thus the universe or the fabric of space-time expanded much faster than the speed of light shortly after the Big Bang.  This explains how something can be more than 13.8 billion light years away.",

But given the inescapable scientific proof we have now gathered that everything is energy at the most fundamental levels, it seems this world (and everybody in it) isn’t physical at all. Whether we call it the unfolding implicate/explicate order, “irregularities in the fabric of space,” Planck scale information, or Platonic ideals doesn’t matter. Invisible, intangible and unfathomably powerful energies lie at the foundation of the universe, interconnecting and interpenetrating all life—unfolding as life. And these energies are best understood as information/intelligence/consciousness itself.\nconsciousness given to us by our creator, the Living God.",

                        "context": "That still doesn't make sense to me because during the Big Bang every particle of being was rapidly taking on mass; therefore, by the time those particles were spread out merely the distance of the Earth's diameter, the amount of mass would have forced the obeyance of the speed of light. Moreover, the Big Bang itself would have to, by definition, exist in some kind of \"space.\" The rapid expansion of matter simply began filling the preexisting \"space.\" The convoluted explanations we hear from astronomers and physicists regarding the nature of the Big Bang mostly sounds like inverse logic to me. They affirm the existence of the primordial atom, then try and explain what happened by relying on what they see now. There never is an explanation of what it was that actually expanded. My initial question still stands. How does something exist 20 Billion light years ago in a Universe that is only 13.8 Billion years old. I think most physicists and astronomers just spout a lot of jargon out there because of their own hubris. Just because our brand of logic works on this world and in this galaxy, doesn't mean it works in a galaxy or a part of the Universe 500 million light years away from us. I mean, physics (read: logic) breaks down inside a Black Hole, right? So, there's a precedent for such a phenomenon. Astronomy and physics is mostly a lot of fun to think about, but its fundamental core is something we can never know in a Billion lifetimes.",

If so, what?  Fact: You claimed there are people pushing that narrative you described.  I requested you let us know when you see someone doing that.\n\nWhere's there any opinion there?  There isn't.\n\nSecond sentence: \"In the real world, I mean ... not just in your head.\"\n\nThat's just a clarification of the request in the first sentence.  Let us know when you see someone pushing that narrative in the real world.  If it's just in your head, I'm not asking you to let us know about that.\n\nAgain, no opinion, just a request.  The request stands.\n\n\"no actual scientific evidence to back up your claims\" ... What claims???\n\n\"I don't know why you are so confused all the time\" ... You think I stated an opinion when I haven't.  You think I've made claims, but can't say what claims I've made that you dispute.  It's clear who's confused.

Which ultimately points to the possibility that there are no such things as: separation and objectivity. Which blows everything out of the water. I’m not going to get into the Copenhagen Interpretation and the wave function of particles. But taken to its logical conclusion, the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics seems to imply that “reality”—the world as we know it—can only take place if some sort of measurement or observation takes place on the macro level of existence, the level where scientists and all of us more ordinary human beings operate, which means that not only is everything energy, it responds to consciousness itself. \nin other words we all live in a world CREATED by GOD himself.\nand as such creations, we live bound by the laws of physics he has set as laws and most certainly in a universe far more complicated and beautiful than the dull mindless interpretations of the atheist.\nto simply dismiss the universe and life on earth as a happy accident is truly an act of Faith by the atheists.",
