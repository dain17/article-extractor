Every topic your softness comes out, and you wonder why your country is burning to the ground and why you're being eaten alive by the black double standard two steps away from becoming their minority worshiping cotton-picking slaves. You know why most of you stay silent your whole lives around racist violent black animals like scared little girls terrified of speaking your mind? I do, it's because of suburban softness, most of you wouldn't know how to throw a punch in a fight if your life depended on it so you're scared to death of them and stay silent, how's that working out for our country?
