Jupiter and Saturn  and a quarter moon were all in the sky that night.  Was absolutely speechless viewing both planets and realizing what I was seeing was real!  \n\nAnyways. . .

Thus all things conform to the line which I have set. For My will is a rock which can never be moved, the confines in which all creation exists...\n\nTherefore here is wisdom, the only knowledge which endures forever, true understanding:\nI AM. And you are in life because of Me. And all that is, even all these worlds to every star you see in the heavens, was made according to the wisdom of The Father, brought forth and established through The Son, by whom all things consist. For I AM, and have always been, The Way and The Life, The Salvation of God, The Only Truth from which all understanding flows...
