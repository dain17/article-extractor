So if a meteor that hit the earth 65,000.000 million years ago caused the ice age and wiped out the Dinosaurs then this planet was in a deep freeze for over 65 million years even if mankind appeared only during the end of the ice age would still make mankind older than they have stated either way. They have proven carbon dating is not accurate and not a viable means to determine the age of anything. \nSo even if a meteor was to hit the earth today mankind would never survive it no matter what mankind tries to do to survive, because the imminent Ice age that will occur shortly after will last longer than any food supplies they can store, and when it will take millions of years before the climate will change again to make it hospitable to plant life to grow crops again.",

I love how science teaches this stuff as if it's carved in stone fact, and then someone makes a discovery that reveals their first \"truths\" about the subject were completely wrong, and now they have a new truth.  Now, the new truth, is the only truth, and if you dispute it, you are a heretic of sorts.  You remain the heretic until, of course, someone discovers new facts, and the most recent new truth suddenly becomes antiquated and wrong and now we have another new truth.  This just recently happened with the Big Bang theory.  Through the use of the new James Webb Space Telescope, scientists have discovered startling evidence that the far away galaxies exhibit characteristics that contradict a big-bang event ever occurring.  In essence, the new truth debunks the big-bang theory, and it has scientists literally panicking.  The same thing happened to the evolution theory.  Science still teaches it as if it is absolute fact and truth, yet through our modern understanding of DNA, we now know that the evolution model is false.  We now know that micro evolution is possible, but macro evolution never takes place.  In other words, a finches' beak may change to adapt to a different food source, but it's still a finch, it's still a bird; however, a fish can never leave the water and become a mammal no matter how much time you give it to do so.",
