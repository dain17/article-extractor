Man, like all other creature‚Äôs on this rock, have one innate characteristic they share, to breed and evolve. Using the Ocean‚Äôs will eventually be needed before we can achieve the ability to colonize other celestial bodies, but it‚Äôs easier to do that then to do what is needed as precurser‚Äôs to living off-world, we need to develope outpost‚Äôs on other moon‚Äôs and planet‚Äôs in order to hopscotch the Galaxy, let alone one day venture into Interstellar Space. Once we have a good start off this planet, we can then focus on doing more in our Ocean‚Äôs. Unfortunately the only good thing I see coming from inhabiting the Ocean‚Äôs, is saving man from a Global Catastrophy, more than likely all it will actually produce is more die out‚Äôs of specie‚Äôs due to our ever negligent polluting survival. Human‚Äôs are parasite‚Äôs and until we learn how to survive without destroying, that‚Äôs all we will ever be. Eventually we‚Äôll eat ourselves out of house, home, and planet‚Äôs and star‚Äôs!",
