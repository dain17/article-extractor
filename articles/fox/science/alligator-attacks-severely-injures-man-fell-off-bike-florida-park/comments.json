If you see a pond of water of any size in Florida, there is a 99.9% chance that there is an alligator living there. Alligators see every living being as food. They are not your friend. They are not cute and cuddly. They are a killing machine. That being said I grew up swimming in the lakes and rivers with them. They are very active at dawn and dusk and there favorite food is small mammals. If you feed them they will come back time and again to be fed again. Give them their space and pay attention and you will have no worries. But if you go swimming with your dog at sundown all bets are off. The up side is they are really good to eat and make really nice leather and there are millions in Florida",

He related that more than a few dozen times, he would have to stop on the road and yell at some snowbird golfers to step away from the gators as they would venture as close as six feet sometimes. Once, he was confronted by this snowbird who wanted to know how my acquaintance had the right to tell him what to do. He replied, \"Because I am the guy today who will have to put all your pieces back together when that monster tears you up!\"  It was then that the snowbird had an epiphany of sorts and let the gator be. They are like torpedoes when in the water but they can jump and run very fast for short distances on land. They are interesting critters and I love watching them in the marsh and bayou behind my home..........elevated 20 feet above the gators!",

What really is going on there is the most passive males are pushed out the water by large bull males that will not tolerate them. So when trappers get to keep the 6 to 7 foot passive males that means a big rogue gator nearby is about to be problem for humans. \n\nAnother problem in Florida is the continued pet trade of Pythons.

We went down and visited her once, she had a large dog - alaskan malamute that loved to swim in the pond next to her apartment. I pointed out in Florida if there is water, chances are there are alligators in it. She made fun of me, called me ignorant, the next day as we watched a crew came out was throwing  chicken on a large hook into the water (she'd taken the day off because we were there). She wondered what they were doing, I thought (wait for it...) soon enough they pulled a couple 5-6' gators out of the pond.  No apology came so I walked over and asked them how frequently they   did this, their response (about once a month, usually get at least 2 each time), again silence. Lucky for the dog the gators apparently thought it was too big to handle. Incidentally on that same trip I told her her brakes needed to be replaced on her car because I could hear the wear indicators squealing. The next week my ex-wife got a call that she took the car to a gas station and they told her just to add brake fluid. The next month her brakes went out and she wrecked the car, she could not afford to fix it and had to move home....",

Once a big huge guy (probably 13' long) was laying across both directions of the Alley.  A guy coming from the opposite direction yelled over to me, \"Are you going to get him to move or am I?\" And, we had a good laugh and waited about 15 minutes before he finally moved enough to pass.

In the 50's till late 60\"s the gator population was controlled, until they were declared an endangered species. Than they were \"Protected\" and their population grew rapidly. In the 50's swimming in a lake in South Florida, or the canals were safe, no predictor to kill you. And camps in central and northern Florida always had swimming in the lakes and open water, Winter Park and Orlando homeowners has access to the water ponds in their neighborhoods and used them safely. NOW that the Gators have been \"Protected\" the Gators own all the open fresh water in the state! Even looking for a golf ball hit into the water, is a life risking adventure.",
