It was just a rock shaped like a vee. I took it to have it appraised and the lady told me   Sure nuff that looks like an old rock. I asked her how old. She said how do I know I’m just a waitress at this bar, I don’t own it!!! She did give me a dollar for it because she collects rocks and make jewelry with them. Next time I saw her she told me she made a necklace with th rock she bought from me and sold it for $100.00. Wow I said that’s something. She bought me a beer and took me home with her and hired me to trim her bushes. Oh did I tell you when I found the rock, I was holding a sign that said, will work for food. So you see good things do come to people who are willing to put themselves out there to take a chance. ",
