The Animal National Territorial Independent Facist Association (ANTIFA) stepped in to negotiate the territorial dispute, but Border Independence Democrat Egotistical Nincompoops (BIDEN) failed to secure the borders for the indigenous residents. They said this was monkey business and failed to take any action. However, BIDEN will send two pallets of bananas to the monkeys, if they would leave the gorillas alone and stop enriching their territory. John Kerry said that Cimate Change was the root cause for the aggression due to high levels of CO2.  To solve the problem the Foreign Association of Undeveloped Congo Interpreters (FAUCI) said that the wearing of masks and social distancing would alleviate the problem because the monkeys wouldn't be able to identify the gorillas wearing masks and not being up close.",

Their peaceful and generous natures make them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills... which are unrivaled by any other culture. Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an inspiration to all who hope to achieve prominence and success as people. Real estate values are fueled by the influx of black Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nature toward these communities... an example of all they have achieved through their enthusiasm for self improvement by hard work and a self-reliant nature. Without their industrious and creative drive, the USA would be poorer as a nation.",
