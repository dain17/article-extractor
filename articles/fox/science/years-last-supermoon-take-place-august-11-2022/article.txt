Aug. 11 is the last chance to catch a glimpse of this year's supermoons. This will be the third and final supermoon of the year. 

According to Life Savvy, the moon's peak is set to occur at 9:36 p.m. ET and will be shining though the night.

The other name for this supermoon is the Sturgeon Moon, which was named after the sturgeon fish that were caught during this time of year.

According to NASA, a supermoon "occurs when the moon's orbit is closest to Earth at the same time the moon is full." 

So what will that look like for us on Earth? The moon on Aug. 11 will be slightly brighter than it is on an average night. 

Even though this is the last supermoon of the year, there are also some other sightings to catch in August. Travel + Leisure reports that from Aug. 11-12, the Perseids Meteor Shower will occur, but there will also be a full moon that day, which could make it hard to see the shooting stars. 

On Aug. 14, Saturn will reach opposition, making it brighter than it usually is. 

And at the end of the month, NASA could potentially launch Artemis 1 on Aug. 29.
