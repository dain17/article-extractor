The problem is, it is not coming from white people. \n\nAmerican black culture was born out of rebellion and resistance towards an unfair system at that time. Yet, it has failed to change with the changes in society. It's not a culture that can mix with other cultures because it is,  by design, rebellious and resistant.\n\nEverything from language to appearance is almost the direct opposite of \"white culture\" for lack of a better term. \n\nAsking white people to accept or adapt to the American black culture is not practical or even possible because it is in direct conflict and geared to rebel against white people. \n\nThis really isn't hard to understand. In American black culture, white people are the enemy from the start. That has to change before anything else can. \n\nNaturally, a culture that is inherently rebellious is not sustainable, even for it's own people. Once the rest of society distances itself from the culture, the same rebellious qualities will turn inward toward each other because that is all you know. \n\nThey are right about a systemic problem, but they are looking to make changes in the wrong place.",
