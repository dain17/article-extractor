One of the guys just jumps off the boat Steve Irwin style and grabs this dang six-foot alligator from behind by the tail and starts dragging him and the other guy produces a shotgun and shoots the alligator in the head with a slug. They had a propane deep fryer with them and they cleaned the gator right there and fried up gator tail nuggets, turtle nuggets, and french fries and when they found out we had plenty of beer in our cooler, they were happy to share and we all had a huge feast.
