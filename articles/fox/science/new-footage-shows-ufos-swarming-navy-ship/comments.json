Soon there will be a UFO (UAP) disclosure where the Globalist, New Worl Order proponents claim that they are our saviors and that all life on earth was seeded from aliens.  It is a lie.  These are not extra terrestrials from others planets although they are beings from another dimension.  They are demons, the seed of fallen angels and they come to deceive in these last days before Christ's return.  Oh, I know some of you may say that I am nuts, but I am quite sane and to say that we have ET's that seeded life on earth and have come to save us is NUTS and a lie from Satan himself, the deceiver.  When the Church is taken out of this earth to be with Christ, the Deceiver will lead the ungodly to believe that we were taken out because we were hindering the good.  Another lie.  Jesus said, \"Do not be deceived!\"",
