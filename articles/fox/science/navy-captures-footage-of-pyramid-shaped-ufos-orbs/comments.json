These supposedly psychic manifestations, or phenomena are actually fallen angels (demons) masquerading as extraterrestrials; they are just another variation of the age-old demonological phenomenon.

They are a personal archetype of being, that is, they are beings perceived by intelligence and by the will of like interlocutors. They are rational and gifted with will, they are also gifted with power.

They possess this attribute taking into possession this world, and its humanity in order to show that in, and through these mediums their nature as powers.

Back during the 1990s while overseas in Panama I was playing on a military golf course in Panama during a weekday after work with two golfing buddies. The hole number escapes my memory—boomer syndrome —at the moment but the location is seared in my mind.  We were on the putting green, the Bay of Panama behind us.  As we begun to putt we heard this huge splash.  All 3 of us annoyed at the noise turned to look at the bay.  We thought initially it was a big game fish fleeing. Instead we saw suspended  several feet above the water a silver tear drop orb. There was no other noise other than the initial splash of it breaking the water surface. We all stared at it in disbelief.  It did not stay suspended in place very long. It began to move away from the water exit point with the dome end of the sideway teardrop leading. It followed the contour of the bay.  appearing to pickup incredible speed, again without a sound—then it was gone.  We looked at each. The army pilot in the group chuckled, the school teacher nervously laughed. I piped up, —anybody on drugs? Anybody smoking? Nope, anybody drinking? Nope. That was some fish uh?? Yup, and we all three walked back to the green to resume finishing the hole by putting out,  We guessed it was unexplained explorer orb of some kind taking samples from the sea, Why else was it in the water??",
