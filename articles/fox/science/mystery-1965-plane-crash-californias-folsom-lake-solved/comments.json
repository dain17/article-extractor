The collision took place about 2 miles from the Dam and the plane crashed into the water and exploded  in 125 - 300 feet of water off Beales Point.  The other three people on the plane were Pilot Ford Marshall (Age 50), Helen Gotcher (Age 51) and 15 year old Glen Emmick. Curtis Metcalf, the Pilot of the other plane was able to fly to and land at Sacramento Municipal with one tail stabilizer ripped off. Metcalf ran a Flight Service and had two passengers on board for a sightseeing trip. Metcalf did not see the other plane, only felt a bump then saw the other plane dive straight into the water. The impact took place at 3000 feet on New Years Day, Metcalf pulled out of his dive at 1500 feet. Metcalf was flying a single Engine Beechcraft. The impact was determined to be a Broadside Impact between the two aircraft.  The Marshall's and their passengers were also on a sightseeing flight. A U.S. Navy four man Dive Team conducted a dragging exercise to attempt to locate the aircraft. A Lady by the name of Mrs Johanson witnessed the crash, location was determined by marking the spot on the window she was looking out when she witnessed the crash. The Marshall's were from Roseville, Ford Marshall was the owner of Town House Motel in Roseville. Glen Emick was a Roseville H.S. student and Helen Gotcher was originally from Lincoln but a resident of Roseville.",
