A telescope is a unique way to see the moon, first time my kids saw it, they were truly impressed (and they are not easily impressed) .   A lunar eclipse is also a special thing to see as well. And many other things, comets ( I saw Hale-Bopp) from my home in Atlanta, and again from the deck of a ship in the China Sea, Halley's comet in the 80's and it won't be back until 2061.  I won't be alive then, so glad I saw it once in my life.  I've seen several solar eclipses, truly incredible, when the sun is totally covered, the birds start chirping and go to their nests for the night.  It's beautiful . Many planetary alignments can be seen easily from Earth, and constellations. Meteor showers are not to be missed. I'm not a astronomy geek, but I know one.",

The democrats and the left are producing racial tension and hatred between the people to stir the pot for a power control of the people.
