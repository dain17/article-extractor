Even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion:\nA year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, \"It might be nice to have another child.\"\nI have never heard a guy say, \"You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.\"\nI rest my case.\nTime for another beer.",

I was so bored I called Jake from State Farm just to talk to someone. He asked me what I was wearing.\n3.  2019: Stay away from negative people. 2020: Stay away from positive people.\n4.  The world has turned upside down. Old folks are sneaking out of the house and their kids are yelling at them to stay home!\n5.  This morning I saw a neighbor talking to her dog. It was obvious she thought her dog understood her. I came into my house and told my cat. We laughed a lot.\n6.  Every few days try your jeans on just to make sure they fit. Pajamas will have you believe all is well in the kingdom.\n7. Does anyone know if we can take showers yet or should we just keep washing our hands?\n8. This virus has done what no woman has been able to do. Cancel sports, shut down all bars and keep men at home!\n9. I never thought the comment, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt touch him/her with a 6-foot pole‚Äù would become a national policy, but here we are!\n10. I need to practice social-distancing from the refrigerator.\n11. I hope the weather is good tomorrow for my trip to the backyard. I‚Äôm getting tired of the living room.\n12. Never in a million years could I have imagined I would go up to a bank teller wearing a mask and ask for money.\n13. Not sure if my body absorbed all the hand sanitizer but I have noticed that the toilet seems to clean itself.",
