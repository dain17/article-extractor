So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.  3 Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.  4 They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.  6 In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.",
