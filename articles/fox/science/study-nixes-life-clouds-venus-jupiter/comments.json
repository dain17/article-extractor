Written 500 years before Christ. Then his work was stolen and plagiarized to create the so called \"golden rule\".\nIf everyone lived with that philosophy, religion would be obsolete. The ONLY reason Christianity still exists is the coercive fear instilled to young children from birth, obey or burn. Why not let children learn many religions and decide for themselves? No, their parents need to coerce them to believe.\n\nOh, and your incredible claim question has nothing to do with evolution.

Christianity may have started with Christ, but its foundation is much, much older.\n\nYour statement about coercive fear requires evidence, and you have already displayed your ignorance of the Christian worldview.  And your statement about children being exposed to more religions and able to pick for themselves...  That happens more often than not.  Christianity is not genetic.  You don't become one at birth.  You choose to become one.  Ask many of the Atheists that came to the faith after decades of fighting against it.\n\nThe origin of life, and the universe, is the crux of the matter.  It always has been.  Without a correct lens to view the world, you only see what you want to see.  If you want a world without God and consequences for your actions, you invent an origin that does not require Him.",

That is EXACTLY what I posted you people do earlier. When parents start religious coercion on children far too young to understand it, they use images of h3ll, devils and burning if the children don't believe and obey.

You are merely adopting theoretical explanations for the origin of the universe that sound good to you, even as you claim you don't know how it happened.  The common thread is, you reject other explanations that include material you simply do not want to believe.

I never claimed enlightenment is unique to one particular religion or another.

A court room doesn't use the same standards as the scientific community, which doesn't use the same standards of proof that common people in society use to make general decisions about what is reality or not.  Seems you have a shifting definition of what is and is not evidence, OR you haven't clearly defined what it is and stepped into the conversation with a couple of assumptions built in.  \n\nThe two statements are complimentary, but each stand on their own.  When you are wronged, do not seek out vengeance.  Love you neighbor as yourself.  If you do that later, you do not do the former.  Why was the vengeance part first?  It only matters to those interested in nit-picking the passages for loopholes rather than taking it at face value.  That's like asking why Spanish has different places for their verbs and nouns in their sentence structure.",

The vast majority aid and abet, stand and watch, listen and follow their leaders, participate indirectly and directly using righteous beliefs as reinforced by their leaders and biased beliefs to perform the atrocities. Nazi Germany is the latest example with over 70% of its population being \"good\" Christians. The coercive nature of organized religion is insidious and once it gains a majority in a country, it takes over the government, then can use the resources to coerce others and inflict pain, misery and death to the non believers.",

You are somehow just hung up on the ones that gained power and rocked the boat, to coin a phrase.  Understandable but you still need to keep it in context.  There have always been evil people.  Start acting like that is a reality and stop pretending groups are responsible for the actions of the evil individuals.\n\nThere were very few 'good' Christians that acted in Nazi Germany, and they were the ones that helped hide the Jews under threat of their own lives.  I'd argue that most Christians are not 'good' at all.  Christ himself sad that many will call his name and he would reply that he never knew them.  Actions and behavior are indicators of faith, not words or claims.\n\nSuch is why we have taken great care to separate the government from religion in the western world.  But, fanaticism is inevitable as government will become its own religion (as it is quite near to doing right now) and seek to impose itself on the country again.  It is only through strict tenets that evil is kept at bay.",

Your kind always does because of the animosity you hold towards religion (Christianity).  Let me clear it up for you.  The Constitution never meant to keep religion out of the government.

Others need to be updated for more modern issues that weren't possible to foresee when it was written, however... separation of church and state were not one of them.

It is really that simple.  People just want it to be more.\n\nI apologize for misreading your last post.",

They are all metaphysical constructs we use to understand the universe.  Throwing away philosophy just because you don't like it, ... well, that's foolish. \n\nRight, the universe began with a bang.  As far as we project and assume.  We can't push it back further because time essentially began there.  Space began there.  Energy became light and matter.  The physical laws of the universe began there.  We have no frame of reference beyond it.  But something caused it all.  I call that something God.  You can call it whatever you want.

What is your response to my post that ID in NOT science because it does NOT have a falsifiable hypothesis? Two of the primary ID arguments, irreducible complexity and accelerated nuclear decay have been shown to be false numerous times. ID has ZERO published studies and data other than in religious works, why is that?\nThese are just a few of the sources and arguments you can refute. Good luck.\n\nIt is not necessary to \"bear witness\" or \"replicate anything\" to prove things in nature. That's the old \"falling tree in the forest doesn't make a sound\" ignorance. Crimes are solved by forensics as are cosmological problems. The scientific tools of physics and mathematics allow the human mind to understand nature and is the language of nature that we can understand to some degree. No super being is created to explain anything, a scientist would simply say \"I don't know, I'll figure it out\". Philosophy crosses over the boundary of the scientific method when super beings are postulated. And since it is impossible to prove the existence of a super being, that renders it UN scientific.\n\nAs for the \"cause\" of the BB, we don't even know if there was a cause. You stop short of admitting that. It's possible, philosophically, for another universe prior to the BB coalesced to the singularity, or maybe there's a pulsing of matter-antimatter, etc. we simply don't know. You and religious adherents create a god instead of saying you don't know.",

I will not continue to debate this.\n\n\"It is not necessary to \"bear witness\" or \"replicate anything\" to prove things in nature\" - Depends on what you mean by 'prove things'.  You want to convince a skeptic that things work a certain way, you must show them.  You want to make claims that alter the fundamental assumptions of origins, you must prove them definitively.  This is what it means to provide incredible evidence for incredible claims.  Otherwise, an uncaused caused is just as logically sound as any other theory you can provide on the origins of the universe.  \n\n\"its possible for another universe to have...\" - Blah, blah, blah.  As I said before, causality requires an initial cause.  If a universe caused this one, then one caused that one.  Keep rewinding until your mind breaks or you admit that something had to have kicked started the whole thing.  Had to have CHOSEN to start it because forces don't act on their own, they simply are.",

You need to study physics more. Leonard Susskind showed that in holograms is but one example. I am still using the definition of what you gave, and it is nebulous at best.\nChanges in critter DNA happens on a random basis, however, it is NOT the primary reason behind evolution, that is natural selection. Critters that survive pass on their DNA, random changes occur and a few change the critter for enhanced survival for the next generation, most changes do nothing a fewer are detrimental.",

It‚Äôs only here, on this Earth ‚Äî nowhere else. Get over it, affeists. Your god is dead. ‚ÄúTime‚Äù has no ideas. Material has no wisdom. And the universe has no intentionality.

Since my god declared it and it's written in the bible so it must be TRUE!!!! OOOOO, we're sooooooo scared of burning for eternity in an afterlife we must obey.\n\nHow's it feel to live in constant fear and subject your 5 children to it?
