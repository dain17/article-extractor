That's USING science to develop a \"theory.\" If your observations agree with your predictions often enough it becomes a \"law\" - at least when I was studying for my physics degree in the 70's. But even the \"laws\" we develop aren't necessarily absolute and can change. We went for hundreds of years believing Newton's \"laws of motion\" were cprrect. Einstein, and his theory of relativity, showed that Newton's laws were very good approximations at non-relativist speeds. However as the velocity approaches the speed of light Newton's laws totally break down.\n That's what science is about. You formulate a hypothesis to explain what you observe but you can NEVER call the reality itself \"science\" as you want to do. Science is the process of developing a theory and attempting to explain it in terms as you understand them. But science is ever-changing. NOT like you trying to say the Copernicus misinterpreted the \"science of the universe.\"\n Science is the process of developing a theory. It is NOT what the reality may be, and in his case what it turned out not to be as he thought. The truth and reality is the end goal, science is a tool to get there. \n You cannot \"confirm\" science as you said. You can only try to \"confirm\" the conclusion your draw by USING science.\n \n But enough. I can see nothing will satisfy you when it comes to science.

Proof not even close.\n\nIf they claim the mineral and or chemical content matches samples or readings from Mars they would have to assume Martian rock component ratio is unique to Mars alone.\n\nThe Scientific Method is open to and welcomes theories as a basis to explore and refine our knowledge. It also requires that before anything can be established as a fact that said claim must be something that can be observed  and independently verified in a controlled environment.\n\nWe can do repeat independent analysis of the chemical and mineral composition in a controlled environment and we can do independently verifiable repeat Carbon dating in a controlled environment.\n\nProof that it came from Mars and how many millions of years ago is far beyond meeting any level of even an accurate probability.",
