President Biden on Monday revealed the first image from the newly operational James Webb Space Telescope, giving a glimpse into a vast universe.

Biden released the image from the White House during a briefing with NASA officials. 

"This telescope embodies how America will lead the world, not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example," Biden said. 

"The image showed various galaxies that shined around other galaxies whose light has been bent," or gravitationally lensed, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. 

"If you held a grain of sand on the tip of your finger at arms length, that is the part of the universe that you're seeing. Just one little speck of the universe," he said. 

On Monday, the space agency said the six-month process to prepare the telescope had been complete, meaning all 17 ways or "modes" to operate the Webb's scientific instruments have been checked. 

"All of the seventeen ways or 'modes' to operate Webb's scientific instruments have now been checked out, which means that Webb has completed its commissioning activities and is ready to begin full scientific operations," mission team members wrote.

The rest of the first batch of Webb Telescope images are expected to be released Tuesday. The telescope launched in December with its primary mission to view objects far and wide. 

The $10 billion Webb — successor to the almost 32-year-old Hubble Space Telescope — blasted off from South America in December and reached its designated perch in January.
