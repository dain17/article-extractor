For one, there is no evidence that the universe began in a Big Bang. No one has ever witnessed matter appearing out of empty space, certainly not the entire universe. \n\nFor another, any signals we are detecting are here now, otherwise our instruments could not detect them. Their origins are unknown and speculating they came from the beginnings of the universe is bad science. \n\nBesides, hydrogen does not emit signals in the radio spectrum, its emissions are in the light spectrum, the lowest being in the frequency range of the color red.  Hydrogen emits single line spectra when it's single electron changes energy states from a higher level to a lower level. In order for it to be detectable, the temperature of the source would have to be pretty high, like in a star.",

Because of that speed of Light, we are looking at what was, and may no longer be, because of how old the visual information is, that we are seeing now!
