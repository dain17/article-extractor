The carcass of the four-legged land creature was not flattened, as is the case with many fossilized vertebrates. But most strangely, it was found in an area known primarily for fossilized marine creatures.\n\nPrevious vertebrate fossils found in this oil sand formation were marine reptiles, like the ichthyosaur and plesiosaur. Marine invertebrates such as clams and ammonites are the more typical fossils found in the region, so a large, land-living ankylosaur \"wasn't supposed to be there.\"1\n\nBut finding a mixture of fossilized marine and land creatures together is not an unusual occurrence. For example, the famous dinosaur beds in the Morrison Formation at Dinosaur National Monument contain logs, clams, snails, and mammals.2\n\nMedical doctor Carl Werner actually used fossil-related criteria as a test for evolution.2 He reasoned that if the evolutionary story were true and that dinosaurs lived in a unique \"Age of Reptiles,\" and if everyday natural processes were responsible for their fossilization, then no fossils of creatures from other \"ages\"‚Äîfor example, creatures that had not yet evolved‚Äîshould be mixed up with dinosaur fossils.\n...cont'd below",
