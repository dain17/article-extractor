Meanwhile illegal aliens, ahem, flood California and no policies are instituted to deal with them or the water they use. A few heavy rainy seasons commence, and everyone forgets about the last batch of stooges when a new batch of stooges takes over in say, 2026 and declares, \" This is the worst drought since Cain and Abel squared off.\" The cycle continues as stupid Californians elect do-nothing Democrat stooges who schill for the Enviro-Nazis and do nothing about illegal immigration and the lack of genuine water management skills.",
