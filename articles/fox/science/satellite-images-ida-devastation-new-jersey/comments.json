Yet, they never do, hard to feel sorry for those in the Lost Valley. There was quite a bit of money offered for their homes that these residents could have availed themselves to. I get that residents did not want to leave homes that their families had built way before flooding became more of an issue.\n\nAdditionally the area has been way over built like many areas in Central Jersey. The few retention ponds there are are not enough to handle huge storms like this.\n\nQuite a bit of government money was thrown at water management in Manville and Bound Brook. Looks like not enough reached the areas that needed it.\n\nBTW, that is a branch of the Raritan River by Manville. The Raritan River overflowed it's banks into the D&R Canal in Franklin causing traffic issues all along Easton Ave which is a  major thoroughfare to 287. The Millstone River also impacted Franklin in East Millstone as well as Millstone. Don't see any coverage of those areas.",

New Jersey's GDP per capita is $63,492 (2019), placing it in the top 10 among states.  39.7% of Garden State residents have a Bachelors Degree or higher - 4th among states.  16% have an advanced degree - 6th among states.  Now, look up the states at the bottom of these measures of productivity and educational attainment.  Notice anything about them?\n\nI absolutely support the people of Louisiana in their recovery from Hurricane Ida.  They are our fellow Americans, and deserve our help.  I would never, ever, say about them what you said about the people of New Jersey.  Yet, in the interest of completeness, Louisiana's GDP per capita is about $51,000; 25% of its residents have a Bachelors or better (48th among states) and 9% have a graduate degree (48th).",
