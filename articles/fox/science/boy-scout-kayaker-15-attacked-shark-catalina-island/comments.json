Advanced Scuba Diving Training Courses you are taught that you never dive before 08:30 H AM or even better 09:00 H AM.. the same thing at 17:30 - 19-30 H PM.. after that ok, and always adjusting for Daylight SAVINGS TIME.  At those hours the sun is angled at a spectrum of degrees that provides a luminosity which triggers the sharks and most marine life to ascend to the surface and feed.  They do not eat lunch.. but they eat breakfast and supper pretty much the same time as children get hungry. Surfers often try to catch the returning Tide waves early in the morning and early evening, placing themselves in the worst possible time to be in the feeding zone. Catalina island is known as a home to Great Whites. Having kids out on the water at 07:15H AM is outright a sacrifice. Please know this when you are around the ocean. Attacks can always happen but those hours are the highest by a long shot, that something swimming at the surface will get attacked.",
