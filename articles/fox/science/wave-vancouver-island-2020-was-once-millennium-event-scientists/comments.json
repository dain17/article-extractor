If I remember correctly one wave in 300 will be twice the average wave height while one in 300,000 will be three times the average height.  These waves do not roam around the planet wreaking destruction, but exist for only moments as two or more waves combine and then just as quickly disperse.  A large wave in itself is not destructive; it is a breaking waves or waves that are dangerous.  A wave breaks as it gets higher (and often, shorter) until it becomes unstable, bends over, and then hundreds, thousands of tons of water cascade down its face.  Breaking waves are very destructive and dangerous to shipping, sometimes damaging or destroying even large, heavily-built steel ships.  Breaking waves are also caused by a current flowing against the wind (a Gulf Stream norther) or by the waves feeling the bottom as they pass over a shoal such as the Outer Banks, also known as the Graveyard of the Sea.",

When you see a sea speckled with white caps, each white cap is a double wave. When surfers wait for the sixth wave, they are waiting for the waves to double up. A tripling is just a double wave overrunning the next wave in front while still combined. Surfers wait for the 6th, 6th wave - the tripple. Happens often with small waves, so probably also happens often with large waves. Every sailor in a storm reports that there are big waves, then, after several waves, there is a bigger wave. Then, very occasionally, there is a really big wave. Just, usually not recorded.",
