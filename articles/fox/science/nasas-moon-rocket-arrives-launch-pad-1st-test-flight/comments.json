It was a massive budgetary sink-hole and failed miserably at it's primary goals -- to make space launches cheap, frequent and safe.  \n\nOnce we got rid of that we went back to where we left off in 1973 -- conventional single-use rockets and apollo-style capsules and landers.  It's only an incremental improvement over Apollo, but we have to relearn how we did it before so we can advance further.  Keep in mind all the people who designed and built Apollo are long gone.  \n\nBut the current Artemis system approach is evolving and by the end of this decade few people expect we'll still be using the single use SLS rocket and Apollo-style capsules.

This rocket may look similar to the Apollo Program rockets but it is infinitely more powerful and complex. The engineering decision was made to have the Human Capsule land via parachutes in the ocean with a recovery ship nearby because quite simply, IT'S THE SAFEST WAY TO LAND ASTRONAUTS. While this may not be the sexiest way to accomplish this, it has been proven to be, from an engineering standpoint, the most repeatably stable and cost-effective system. This ain't StarTek, it's real life. \nSpaceX, which has had obvious success launch small to midsize, unmanned rockets and LOW EARTH ORBIT MANNED CAPSULES is not ready to safely launch humans this far out into space.",
