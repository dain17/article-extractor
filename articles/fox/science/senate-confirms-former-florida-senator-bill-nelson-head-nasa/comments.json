Beating the USSR to the punch was a big part of their focused campaign, of course, but it was more that: the space age ushered in a time of great national pride and excitement, bringing us together in the certainty that we would be the ones to usher in a hopeful future. The whole country looked on in wonder as they relentlessly pursued their ambitious campaign to put man in space.\n\nI feel doubtful that a tired, partisan politician can bring us anywhere close to a NASA resurgence. It's a shame, because our country has never needed a common goal more than we do right now.",
