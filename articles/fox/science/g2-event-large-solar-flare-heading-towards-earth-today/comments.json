Pulled US out of the Paris Climate Accord. \nInsisted on reopening coal mines, criticized energy windmills, pulled funding on climate research, approved deforestation on Well preserved federal land, deregulated dozens of environmental protections, and never cared about the effects it would cause in our nation or the impacts it will have on our warming planet. \n\nTrump knew nothing about scientific data, he knew nothing about his obligations as President, he knew nothing about Governing, he knew nothing about American History, he knew nothing about American Values, he knew nothing about, he knew nothing about foreign policy, our democracy, or rule of law, or the basics and fundamentals of our US Constitution, and very sloppy about handling what little he did do. \n\nWhat‚Äôs worse, is he NEVER even wanted to learn. He could care less to be educated on the most important leadership position anyone could have. He didn‚Äôt even try to understand his role. Instead he watched TV, tweeted nonsense about things that were irrelevant. He criticized everything and everyone. He made a spectacle out of himself. \n\nThat‚Äôs all Trump did in 4 years. A whole lot of NOTHING! Don‚Äôt take my word for it, look at his record! Like the GOP. NOTHING to see there, move along!",
