Possible effects are power grid fluctuations with voltage alarms at higher latitudes. For satellites, it could have orientation irregularities and increased drag in low earth orbit.

The Carrington Event left an aurora visible across the sky, even in latitudes much closer to the equator, and was described in contemporary reports as even brighter than the light of a full moon.

Sky News reports there are a number of classes of solar flares, with X-class being considered the most intense. Saturday's CME was a M-class event, the second strongest behind X.

The Biden Administration is watching for the effects of this flare. NOAA is tracking it.Â
