They are already interfering with land-based astronomy so are 'pollution' in that sense. Per your comment, the ELSA-d  satellite (made by Astroscale) that launched a few days ago is a first step toward junk removal. Musk could never have gotten to where he is today had he spent much time obsessing over all the things that 'could' go wrong (and he does seem to be taking responsibility for controlled de-orbiting of things like second stage boosters - the 'controlled' part failed in this one case).\n\nUndoubtedly there are ways to minimize risk and if I lived in an area without land-based broadband I'd definitely be interested in signing up for Starlink.",
