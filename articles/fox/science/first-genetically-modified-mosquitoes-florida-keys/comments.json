I’m not a scientist, got a “c” in college biology, but I do believe in yin and yang where there is a basic order. There are known and UNKNOWN reactions to changing basic order to life. There are countless variables that affect this species and species that relate to them. Also the species that relate to them,  etc...... I guess that’s progress but I think we as the human race must be cautious because something small like this can have life ending consequences. Look at COVID, the best scientist in the world still don’t know the specifics to a virus that has affected the world.",

As a result, local mosquitoes inherited pieces of the genomes of the GM mosquitoes, the team revealed last week in Scientific Reports. The paper’s suggestion that this genetic mixing could have made the mosquito population “more robust”—more resistant to insecticides, for example, or more likely to transmit disease—has triggered anti-GM news reports, a backlash from some scientists, and strong pushback from Oxitec. The company, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech Intrexon, has a lot at stake; it recently submitted a new generation of its GM mosquitoes for U.S. regulatory review and hopes to conduct its first U.S. field test next year.",
