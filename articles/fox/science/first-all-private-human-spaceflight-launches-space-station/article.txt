Axiom Mission 1, the first private crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS), launched Friday morning. 

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon Endeavour lifted off shortly after 11:17 a.m. ET from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The rocket's first stage booster touched down on the droneship – called "A Shortfall of Gravitas" – at 11:27 a.m. ET. Dragon separation was confirmed just before 11:30 a.m. ET.

The Ax-1 mission sends four private space travelers on a 10-day flight to conduct science and push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight. 

The crew – the first all-private astronaut team – includes former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría and paying passengers Larry Connor, Mark Pathy and Eytan Stibbe. The three businessmen paid $55 million apiece.

"During the mission, the crew will spend eight days on the International Space Station conducting research, outreach and commercial activities," Axiom said in a statement.

They'll arrive at the orbiting laboratory on Saturday after a more than 20-hour flight, and are set to return on April 19.

Friday's flight is the second private charter for SpaceX, which took a billionaire and his guests on a three-day orbit ride last year.

Axiom is targeting next year for its second private flight to the space station.
