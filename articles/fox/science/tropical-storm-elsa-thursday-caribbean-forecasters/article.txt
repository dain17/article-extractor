Tropical Storm Elsa formed from Tropical Depression 5 overnight Wednesday as it headed toward the Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday morning.

Heavy rainfall and possible isolated flash flooding and mudslides will likely hit Barbados and the Windward and Leeland Islands by Friday, forecasters said.

Potential impacts on Florida weren't immediately clear "given the uncertainty in the long-range forecast," the hurricane center said.

Parts of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Hispaniola, Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas will likely have wind and rain through early next week, the NHC said. 

The tropical storm was moving west with current maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. 

A faster west-northwesterly movement was expected within the next 24 to 36 hours, the hurricane center said.
