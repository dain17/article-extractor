Monsanto successfully sued literally hundreds of farmers across the nation, many of them were forced into bankruptcy.  So now we know the rest of the story and why Bill Gates is now the largest independent owner of farmland in America.  Bill Gates just had to let Bayer-Monsanto do his dirty work and bought farm land on the cheap, amazing what liberal billionaires and globalists can accomplish when they work together.

Most of the fish used there are expensive mainly because of size, and scarcity of catch, but also because the mortality rate of the eggs is incredibly low compared to farmed fish. The other positive is the mercury levels of the fish are substantially lower or virtually non-existent. The downside? Farm fish tend to lack the same firmness of wild-catch - either because of salinity issues, stress levels, or something as simple as lack of exercise having to swim in naturally changing currents. Either way - we farm Tilapia, Carp, Salmon, Catfish and a multitude of other species of fish ... it's not really that big of a deal. I'd even wager some grow faster simply because the lab controls the feedings, keeps it consistent and plentiful, and the tanks are far less stressful with no predators or temperature swings to stunt growth.",

He takes the healthy one and uses it for seeds for next year's crop thinking it's more resistant to pests.  He has no idea the reason can be that this tomato's mutation allows it to absorb a higher concentration of naturally occurring arsenic from the soil.\n\nWouldn't you rather have professional scientists in a controlled environment with sophisticated equipment guiding GMO than some farmer or fisherman using only their senses?",

If this company is telling the truth and it filters the water to keep the fish healthy, don't use antibiotics or hormones, and doesn't feed the fish chemicals then the meat SHOULD be as healthy as wild caught.
