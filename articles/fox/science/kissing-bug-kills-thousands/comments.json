In the US most are in southern states, but also are not capable of carrying, much less transmitting, Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas Disease. Transmission to humans occurs when a feeding triatomine bug defecates on the human and then the feces are transferred into a break in the skin. The parasite is NOT injected by the bug's bite. The reason that the disease is more prevalent in Latino's in the USA isn't some racial inequity. It is because they were already infected when they came into the United States. An academic decrying the \"inequity\" of the disease is pure Woke lying. LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION is the reason that Hispanics have the disease. It is endemic to Central and South America. That's where the Hispanics mostly live.\n\nThe statement that physicians are racist for not recognizing the disease is also a lie. EVERY physician, and especially cardiologists, knows that the most common cause of cardiomyopathy in young Hispanics, and maybe older Hispanics as well, who have immigrated from Central or South America is Chagas Disease. \n\nUnfortunately, it is damn hard to treat. It is enough of a problem without some Woke Academic socialist trying to turn it into something it isn't.",
