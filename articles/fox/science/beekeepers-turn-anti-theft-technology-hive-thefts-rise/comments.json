Almonds take a lot of acre/ft of water, but so do pretty much all crops.\nPasture (clover, rye, bermuda and other grasses), 4.92 acre feet per acre\nAlmonds and pistachios, 4.49 acre feet per acre\nAlfalfa, 4.48 acre feet per acre\nCitrus and subtropical fruits (grapefruit, lemons, oranges, dates, avocados, olives, jojoba), 4.23 acre feet per acre\nSugar beets, 3.89 acre feet per acre\nOther fruits (applies, apricots, walnuts, cherries, peaches, nectarines, pears, plums, prunes, figs, kiwis), 3.7 acre feet per acre\nCotton, 3.67 acre feet per acre\nThe list goes on and on... and all are in the same basic amount; 3 to 5 acre/ft of water.  Heck it's not until we get down to cannabis that we see water in the 1.5 a/f range.\nAlso, this gallons-per and acre-ft per X is misleading. I only have to water one almond or citrus tree to get a LOT of produce, but strawberries and tomatoes, which are basically MADE of water, are far worse.\nReally, California's problem is too many people and too little water - all badly managed by greed instead of long-term thinking.",
