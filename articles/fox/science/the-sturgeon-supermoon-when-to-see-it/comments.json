My great grand daddy put that rock there back in 1902. Acrost the street from that rock is a big sign shaped like a fish that says “Big Bob’s Bait and Liquor.” Now listen here. Don't you mess with that rock. There's nothing under that rock. Now, I remember when that fish was on the other side of the road. Some city councilman moved it! He tried to mess with the rock, too. But my grand daddy stopped him. But, anyhow, take a left turn at that rock, go twenty feet and that’s where the Alabaster Sons of the Confederation Goose Club is. Stand still, look up at the sky, and you will see the Super Moon clear as day!”",
