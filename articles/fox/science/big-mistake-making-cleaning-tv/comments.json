When my 50 inch went on the fritz after about 4 years, I took off the back and went on the hunt.\n\nI found the offending board by looking, finding a blown capacitor.  A five cent part.  Checking for a replacement board, after 4 years of use, the part was no longer available.  Going to the electronic repair store I was again told the part was not available.  And the capacitor could not be replaced because the board was sealed in a thick acrylic coating preventing replacement.  But they cannibalize broken sets for working parts.  They had the used board I needed for 90 bucks plus tax with a 30 day guarantee.  A new set cost 500 bucks.\n\nJust a suggestion.  If you're not looking at the set, keep it turned off.  If you want to look at family photos, print them on your computer, purchase frames at the dollar store, and hang them on the wall.",
