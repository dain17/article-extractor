You parked us in the darkest part of the Milky Way so we could observe the heavens. You gave us a stable powerful sun to support us. You slowed down this planet to 24 hours in a day, optimal for humans to thrive, explore, and observe. You raised oxygen levels to 21% over time to get this planet to that optimal point for us and all the life around us.

What we do with our skepticism participates in our outcome. Free will is both our greatest asset and our kryptonite.  A good example of kryptonite is the statement \" You are not welcome here go to the fiction section\" or that, \"science has shown free will is an illusion.\" I suspect science would confirm this earth is rotating at the optimal speed for human life. Science would confirm the sun is at optimal stability to support human life. Science would confirm the luminosity of the sun is ideal for us, even the size of the sun and moon so perfect eclipses to happen gives us the ability to scale the solar system, calibrate calender's maintain historical records, confirm Einsteins concept of general relativity. Optimal fossil fuel storage, tectonic plate activity, it just goes on and on...all of this understanding and structure give us insight into the intellect, affection, character, proclivity, disposition, and will of God deposited into all of us.",
