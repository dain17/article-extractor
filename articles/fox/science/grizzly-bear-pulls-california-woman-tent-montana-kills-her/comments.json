I now live in Eureka,  Montana near the boarder. During our trip from the  Canadian boarder to Ovando we camped in  different settings from campgrounds to wilderness  camps  and Leah was very bear aware. One night, in  a  wilderness camp,  she  and her sister, cooked well away  from  their tent and then hung their food about 3 hundred feet away. Other nights, in campgrounds, we used food storage boxes that are provided in some campgrounds. She didn't have any food in her  tent the night she died. Know, that  she was out doing what she loved and that she was a loving person, a friend, a daughter, a  sister and a nurse,  who at one time may have helped  someone you love. The community of Ovando is  devastated at  this time  but on the morning of the bear attack all I saw there was love and compassion for  myself, Leah's sister and all who  were  present. So, have some compassion and let us mourn for the loss of our  friend.",
