It's worth pointing out the original test shuttle flights had an ejection system, pressure suits for the flight, and Story Musgrave was instrumental in getting an escape system (though not an ejection one) and pressure suits back onto the shuttles after Challenger.  The Russian shuttle also had ejection seats, and while the US considered them not likely to work well in those circumstances, the fact is there were ejections from SR-71s and it was quite remarkable how well ejection can work, especially when you're protected in a pressure suit. Heck, there was a case where the entire Blackbird disintegrated around the pilot in-flight without even an ejection taking place and he survived due to his pressure suit and automated parachute!",

She said there was a report that the crew had survived the impact and the capsule was being brought in. That was the last mention of any survivors or the possibility of such that late night. We searched and recorded the news for months and it was never mentioned again. Of course we didn‚Äôt have internet but if only she‚Äôd had her VCR recording! She knows what she saw and heard.

That sad tragedy lives in my brain right next to JFK, MLKJ, Bobby Kennedy, the NASA silo fire, and 9/11.  ",

Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), and Cong. Bill Nelson (D-FL), both on their respective bodies' Science & Technology Committee were the beneficiaries. The rumor was that they started the entire mission program's foundation. The underlying error in the entire mission is that the space program itself, despite the public perceiving it as a routine operation, was and still is highly experimental in its basic nature. Astronauts accept the risk of that fact. (Alan Shepard quipped that it's pretty scary to sit on the launch pad and realize the whole thing was built by 'the lowest bidder.') I'm not certain that McAuliffe really grasped the fact.  Garn and Nelson both got their 'ride on the space shuttle' and NASA (to McAuliffe's detriment) was pressed into making the mission launches PR events rather than the complex engineering experiments they actually are. Nelson, recently named NASA Administrator by Pres. Biden, was chastised by Gus Grissom's widow (Betty) when his 1st Senate campaign described him as 'an astronaut' despite not meeting the criteria for the title that were in place at the time. In true political fashion, the criteria were changed so that 'Mission Specialist' is now considered an \"Astronaut.\" Fundamentally, both Garn and Nelson were PR cargo on the Shuttle.",

After the German rocket team retired out, Utah had powerful politicians who mandated the big solid rockets for the Space Shuttle Program.  The pressure to use big solid rockets for NASA human space flight is still alive and well today.  Look at the current NASA SLS Program.  The problem with the big solid rockets for human space flight is that you can't turn them off once ignited, posing a safety issue for getting the crew off in the event of a failure.  This has been looked at and studied for years, with no really good solution, but politics still drive their use.  The big solid rockets also make the Air Force Range Safety officers nervous every launch.  What if the Flight Termination System fails?  If so, it is then just a prayer these big solid rockets don't hit a populated area.",
