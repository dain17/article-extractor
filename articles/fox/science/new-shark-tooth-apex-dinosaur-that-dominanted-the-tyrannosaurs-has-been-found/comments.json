Smaller mammals came and competed for food and probably ate the dinosaur eggs. And most likely, gradually dinosaurs over a few more million years disappeared because they couldn't adapt. But no some scientist says that they were here for 35 million years, and one day an asteroid wiped them all out, in just one day after they were here 35 million years.
