This way they can disclose the \"truth\" at a later time without taking the blame for hiding everything from the beginning.  \n\nI only say this as an opinion based on some things that I know about internal diversion efforts.  Who knows what the real agenda is behind this because, to be completely honest, the pentagon has been a part of this cover-up for decades.  but \"pentagon\" is also being used loosely due to the fact that they are compartmentalized (even within its own walls) and it could simply be a whole new division that was only partially aware of these things in the first place. \n\nAdditionally, I used the word \"truth\" in quotes because, from what I do know, I cannot imagine any scenario at all where the real truth would ever be revealed to anyone.",

Or US adversaries are monitoring our military with their top secret advanced equipment. Or these are US black project craft operating in restricted airspace, exactly where they should be doing their testing.\n\nWhat seems more likely? If you study the subject you know about Bob Lazar. He described a craft back in the '80s that was recorded in a Navy video called the \"gimble UFO\" about 20 years later. It gives his story a lot of credibility. According to him we've been working to back-engineer recovered advanced technology of unknown origin. It very well may be that we've had some success.\n\nIn the 2004 Nimitz encounter an object described as a Tic-Tac flew close to a military jet and zipped away. It showed up at a point in the sky many miles away that turned out to be where that same jet was to go before returning to the carrier. Who would do that? Aliens?
