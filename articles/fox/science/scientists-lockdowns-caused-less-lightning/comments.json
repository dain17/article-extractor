We had a lessened number of cases of flu also, could that be because covid19 was over diagnosed?

The less nitrogen that reaches the soil, the less fertile it is which is why farmers add anhydrous ammonia to the soil prior to planting.

In those countries without technical farming it's going to cause famine on a massive scale when coupled with the supply chain issues.
