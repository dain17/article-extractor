We are about 16,000 years out of the last ice age, moving into a tropical age, in addition to the expected increase in volcanic activity.  A volcanic collapse of the ocean floor could actual lower sea levels world wide 75 to 100 meters.  Nearly overnight.  With a gradual recover over two or three thousand years.  Why would this be predicted with some level of confidence?  Because we know it has happened at least a dozen times in the last 250,000 years.  So, it's likely to happen again.  \nEarth quakes accompany this activity.  And it effects many things.  The Tonga volcano last winter has stimulated an increased amount of rainfall.  Flash floods, mudslides, in the middle of a politically proclaimed drought.",
