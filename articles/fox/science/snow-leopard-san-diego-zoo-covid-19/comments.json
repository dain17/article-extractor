Exposure and infection are not the same things.  You could have been infected MONTHS ago and still be shedding DEAD virus dna particles which the PCR test will reveal.  But that shedding leftover dna is NOT evidence of an active infection.  So-called “asymptomatic” infections are NOT infections.  If infection was present, there WOULD be a symptoms....symptoms are the hallmarks of infection. Asymptomatic positive PCR tests are simply evidence that the person had recently been EXPOSED but his immune system successfully blocked the virus from replicating and causing an infection (as it is designed to do)",

I'm not talking about people who have died \"with\" Covid, but they've actually died from a heart attack, or some underlying illness, but because they tested positive, the cause of death was reported as died \"of\" Covid. I'm talking about average semi-healthy people who've tested positive for Covid, and actually died \"from\" Covid. I'm just curious if other's have experienced the same thing that I have. \n\nThere are over 6,000 residence in my town, and although many have tested positive for Covid, nobody has died from it, or even had any severe flu like symptoms, and the majority have had no symptoms at all. We may not realize it, but most of us are connected to thousands of people. Whether it be through family, friends, co-workers, or just passing acquaintances, we all know somebody, who knows somebody, who knows somebody else. Other than what I've heard through the news, and the daily Government report of Covid cases, I still don't personally know of anyone, through my thousands of connections, who has died \"from\" Covid. Has anyone else? Please be honest, and avoid making up Covid stories to fit any political agenda you may have. Just the truth, please. I just need to know, as I'm sure others do as well.",

Even some of those who are considered extremely vulnerable don't die of it. My much older sister has heart problems, diabetes, asthma, and she needed surgery for a blocked artery in her left leg (groin area). She had been exposed to Covid through an in-house twice a week visiting nurse, who was asymptomatic, just a few days before she was scheduled for surgery. So before they admitted her they tested her for Covid, and she tested positive. They quarantined her, but they performed the surgery as scheduled. Of course when she woke up she was in horrible pain, and had Iv's hooked up to her.  But the weird thing is....she had no Covid symptoms whatsoever the entire time she was quarantined in the hospital. According to what we the public have been told, my sister, a 75 year old woman, with heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and having to go through an invasive surgery that lasted 4 1/2 hours would have almost zero chance of surviving Covid.....but she never even had so much as a sniffle from it. At first we thought maybe it was a false positive, but she was tested later and they found antibodies in her blood, which they said meant she did indeed have it.",
