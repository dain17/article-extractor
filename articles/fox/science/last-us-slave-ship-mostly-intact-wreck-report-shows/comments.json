It was an efficient method for the tribal leaders to get rid of potential threats to their superiority. Then there were people from other tribes who were captured and sold. \nArabs are still dealing in slavery today. It has been a profitable endeavor for them for hundreds of years.\nThe Brits were so smug about banning slavery... in England. They still profited from the trade in their colonies and elsewhere in their period of domination. \nThe focus on American slavery, to the exclusion of all others involved in the disgusting and horrific practice, is just more propaganda and hogwash.  Americans fought a war with brother against brother that changed the art of warfare for the entire world. The causes of that war were many but slavery was the prominent one. \n  Many of our forefathers came to America fleeing war and persecution in their former nations. They assimilated, forming a great country; one of which the world had never seen the like. \n  But we made a few mistakes... The main error was subsidizing failure of the Native Americans and blacks rather than melding them into the fabric of our society.",
