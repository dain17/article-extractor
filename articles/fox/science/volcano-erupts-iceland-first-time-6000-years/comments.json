What they are doing is destroying livelihoods, good paying jobs, and an extremely good source of energy. Lord You are aware of what they are doing and why they are doing it, some purposely and some maybe out of ignorance, but it's a demonically driven plan designed to destroy and not help. The global natural disasters are coming because Your Word says they are, all they are doing in the meantime is bringing oppression and depression to our country and our world and a drag on our economic health that we will most likely not recover from till Jesus comes to reign over the whole world from Jerusalem. He who hinders will hinder till he's taken out of the way. In the mighty Name of Jesus Christ and by His authority I pray that these wicked spiritual forces driving these evil plans be hindered and prevented by Your mighty warring forces till the Rapture of Your church.

We ARE the generation to witness the return, the seven year Tribulation, Armageddon and God's Judgement. If Jesus is not your savior, it will be a horrific, miserable time that most will not survive. IF you have believed in Jesus, his sacrifice for your sins and have your faith and trust in Him, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, the Bema Seat Judgement and knowing your name is in the book of Life is yours, along with eternity with God; you're saved by His grace and love.\nFolks, wake up!

Even those that have been sleeping in the depths of the seas will awaken with enormous might. My people, now is the time to strengthen your relationship with your heavenly Father and your relationship is only strengthened through prayer. \n\nMy people, you will not be spared of these events, for mankind has continued to ignore My pleas, My words of warning. Now is the time to open your eyes and hearts to My words because just as I am your merciful Savior who died to save you from your sins, I am again coming to warn you that your lives are not pleasing to Me. Turn off the distractions and let the ways of the world fall to the side because the things of this world can be washed away, but your soul lives on forever. \n\nAs you begin to see lava fall from these mountains more evil souls will be unleashed, so remain on guard. Do not fear this time, rather embrace it knowing that if you are following the will of your heavenly Father you will be saved. Now go forth and respond, respond by living the Gospel message, living the Commandments and cleansing your soul often. Now be at peace for I am Jesus and My mercy and justice will prevail.‚Äù",

Measuring the earth temperature is really irrelevant when it comes to saying we are warming to fast. The weather has had wild temperature swings in the past and the last years have been relatively calm. CO2 is not the culprit that the Gorons (Al Gore morons) would like us to believe. The reason CO2 is used is because they can point to something they can blame that theoretically can be reduced. This is driving them getting rich with green energy solutions. They are pushing the 9 year and it's all over for mankind narrative because there is a real chance that the mandarin minimum will cause a cooling for 70 years and they will be dead and not able to make or spend all the the money from there \"World is going to end \" hysteria. They ask scientist is the earth warming? The answer they have to give is yes! We have been warming since the end of the last glaciation period. They use this in their narrative as proof that 97% agree with their climate change narrative when it only means they agree the earth is getting warmer.\n\n Here is good article that explains the real climate change. Beware you cannot be drinking Al Gore's climate change Kool-Aid while reading it as the confusion would cause your head to explode. This website will not let me insert  the link so copy and paste in your browser. \n\nCO2 lags temperature - what does it mean? (skepticalscience.com)",

No righteous works or good deeds on the earth will save you when you draw your last breath...Only Jesus Christ.\n\nThe 10 commandments are there to show us that we fall miserably short of God. And are in need of the finished work on the cross. JESUS\n\nFor when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
