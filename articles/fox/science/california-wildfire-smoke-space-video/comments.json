That said we manage our fires, California does not.  Seems someone would realize that a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Instead , its the same every year, they try to contain the fires but wind and fuel make it impossible resulting in my state and others having pollution to deal with.   Its completely the governments fault.",
