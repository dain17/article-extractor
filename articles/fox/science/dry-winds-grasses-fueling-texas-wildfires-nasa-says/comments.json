And are creating this Climate with HAARP the weather weapon that they control the whole earth with and the destruction of health with so-called vaccines that are to shorten your life. Wars are not needed anymore as HAARP and the Active Denial system can keep the masses in their place, and if that fails too, they still have the Nuke above two miles up that can take out everyone in the first year after it is used by the USA government and blame it on Russia.
