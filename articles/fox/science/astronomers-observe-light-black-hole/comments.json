Then a black hole is graphically represented showing light/matter ejecting/spewing from polar(?) ends.  But we are told NOTHING escapes - not even light.  Is it just me or does the science seem to bend to make rationalizations supporting earlier claims, or any claim for that matter?\n\nAnd now it's time for armchair astronomers to label me, call me names, say I'm an idiot (I won't claim otherwise), etc.",
