But for us, our planet resides on one outer bands of the vast milky way‚Ä¶. We are more remote than easter island to put it into perspective. Older stars/planets would have a chance to evolve more and colonize outside of their base. I believe we are one of many. If Darwin was the answer, other creatures on earth would be sending rockets to the moon by now too. We were given something by our ancestors that set us apart with our language, intelligence and more‚Ä¶.. but we are also 1/2 earth ingenious too, of which is our setback to the animal kingdom that keeps us as uncivilized as we are civilized.
