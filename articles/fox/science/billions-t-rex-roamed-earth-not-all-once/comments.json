Also, just due to their size they would have retained heat.  Overly simplifying it based on a couple of Google searches of animal weight and how much lions eat, a T Rex would have to eat about 600-700 lbs a day were it a mammal.",

God is all-powerful. He is NOT magical, and doesn't just \"poof\" things into existence. The Bible describes Him as the ultimate energy source...enough energy to start the Big Bang, cause stars to explode, which creates all the  particles of the periodic table, then use gravity to form the particles into planets (accretion), then allowing water particles to stick to some of the planets...then adding coded DNA particles to said water, mix with certain electrical particles to get a one celled amoeba with the code to become all the creatures of the earth. \n\nThis did not happen in the modern 24 hour earth days. How could it? The Bible even said that God started the process before the sun that our earth revolves around was even formed (obviously), so we are not talking 24 hour earth days. We are talking billions and billions and billions of years of a slow process by an all-powerful, intelligent energy source. Quit with the silly stuff that the earth is only 6,000 or 10,000 years old.

Theories become laws once the actual evidence and data make them fact.  Gravitation is NOT a theory.  Electromagnetism is NOT a theory. Those are laws based on the fact that all the evidence and data prove them to be.  On the other hand, evolution is still a theory because the necessary evidence and data to make the Theory of Evolution a law has yet to appear as evidence or data.  Literally no scientist anywhere has found any evidence or data to outright prove evolution as something more than a theory.  Learn the scientific method, son.  First step is observance.  Next step is forming a theory based on that observation. Than you test the theory.  If you prove the theory as true, it becomes law. If you fail to prove that theory as true, it remains just that, a theory, until someone comes along to either prove or disprove the theory.  This is how science has worked for millennia and will remain how science actually works today.  Your TOTALLY warped view of science is how idiots today who actually deny scientific facts and findings have destroyed what science actually is.

While scientific facts have been  proven by scientists and approved by all scientists around the world. So this story has lots of scientific theories that are far  fetched but trying to convince An average intelligent person it’s a fact. Pathetic!",

Listen to yourself.  Pathetic. And no scientific theories (guessing) is not and never has been absolute truth. I know science  extremely well but people like you will not accept what is true and what is guessing .
