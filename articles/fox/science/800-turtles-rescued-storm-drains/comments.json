I've taken good care of her this whole time but she still hates my guts & I'm not particularly fond of her either so we just try to respect one another's privacy.  Like having a darn dinosaur in the house, big enough to break out of her cage whenever she wants to so I had to bail her out of jail this winter after she busted through my sliding screen, jumped from the second story & snarled up traffic in the center of town during a snowstorm.  \n\nWalking into the police station next door to bail her out, was rather embarrassing.  lol",
