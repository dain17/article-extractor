I paid less than half of that AND it's paid off too.  (well...less than half if you don't count the interest, but overall still less than $500K).\n\nI used to SHARE a $300 a month apartment with a Chemical Engineer and like he always said, \"Weed will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no weed.\"   Just a little stoner humor there, but aside from the CRIME and the lack of heat during winter, sharing a $300 a month apartment wasn't so bad. I'm still 95% sure the burglar was the maintenance man in that apartment building - no way to prove it and it's not like the cops care about people who live in such low-rent housing.",

It was nothing fancy - just a ranch-style house about a mile from where my father went camping as a Boy Scout when he was a kid - because when he was a kid that whole area was undeveloped.\n\nMost people can't afford to live in houses like that.  I know I can't.  I'd love to live in that house, but my parents sold it and built their own house that cost far more money.  Maybe I'll inherit that.  LOL, no.  I don't want my parents house. I mean it's nice and everything, but I'd have to move back to Texas.  Still, I'd rather move back there than California or NY.  I actually lived in NY for a month. It was NOT NYC, so It was okay.  I saw .38 Special...in upstate NEW YORK.  Good show.  I'd go again if they were the same band they were back then. Too bad they're not.",

We've already got a few just like every other city in the US. We've had them for YEARS.  Some of them look like refugees from the meat plant in the next county.  Seriously, they hire a lot of actual refugees and of course some of them are illegal.  There's nothing they can do about that unless they start paying a living wage.  Americans won't work in the plants. It's hard work. They use E-Verify but they still get raided by ICE and before they used E-Verify they got fined MILLIONS by the EEOC for trying too hard to keep illegals out of the work force.\n\nThere are some unscrupulous lenders who will give loans to people they know can't pay them off. The whole idea is to collect as much money as they can and foreclose on the home and sell it again which is far more profitable than steady income from low-rent housing.  They do the same thing with car loans too - even the leased ones.\n\nThere are 3 tiers of housing in my neighborhood. There are apartments, townhomes/condos and McMansions. There are no homeless people in my part of town. They're downtown or hanging out in front of stores that we would NEVER walk to. I don't give them money, but sometimes I buy them food.",

The entire 45th floor is owned by anti-American Jihadis who are not only terrorists but war criminals.

They believe the object has either disintegrated in space, or it may be a space ship from another planet which has the ability to nullify all radar beams.\n\nBetty: What are those funny things sticking out of your head?\nRigna: Those are our antennae.\nBetty: Are you a television set?\n\nRigna: Chochem is eight hundred years old, you can't dismiss the wisdom of centuries.\nVoldar: I can.\n\nHer SECOND movie was totally hot though.
