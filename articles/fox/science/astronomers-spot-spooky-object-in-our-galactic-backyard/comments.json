Not only are these two states of relative motion NOT mutually exclusive but are, actually, mutually inclusive and dependent.  It is impossible for body A to revolve around body B without body B to, simultaneously, revolve around body A.  I require only the Wiktionary definition of revolve to make my point.\nVerb\n  1. Physical movement\n    3. to orbit a central point.\nThe choice of a central point is arbitrary in this definition.  So choosing the central point to be that point at the center of mass of the Earth gives the Sun revolving around it.  It does not matter that the Sun is 330,000 times the mass of the Earth because \"revolve\" indicates only the relative change in positions over time.\n\nIt is such a pity so many millions of man-hours and money were wasted in Carl Sagan's pet project SETI.  These resources would have been much better spent on a STI project, the Search for Terrestrial Intelligence.",
