In May, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced an additional $43 million in relief, \n...\nForeign aid to this rogue state is 100 percent fungible. It’s money the Taliban don’t have to spend feeding their people, buying them medicine or building them houses. It’s money that helps free up funds to pay for other items more important to the religious zealots who run the Afghan regime. Things like guns and bombs. And missiles and aircraft. And pilot training and living expenses for bin Laden’s followers in the U.S.\n\n...\nThere must and will be revenge. Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden’s adoring host, is rightly at the top of the target list.\nBut before we send bombs to the land of our enemies, we should stop sending them cooking oil and corn meal.",
