However, the fact is this is probably the most important astronomical body in our solar system other than the earth. Why? Well for one it is the largest moon in the solar system. However, the real interest is because it is believed to contain a gigantic ocean larger and deeper than the earth ideal for life due to the way it orbits Jupiter creating heat and because of residual radioactive heat in the center. This body could be the best chance for life.",

And since it's tidally locked, with the same hemisphere constantly facing Jupiter, all of the moon receives sunlight at some point in the orbit, just like our Moon.  When people talk about the \"dark side of the Moon\", they're actually referring to the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth.  Even the \"dark side\" receives sunlight though, getting two weeks of sunlight during every orbit.  I really wish that Fox would get some \"science\" reporters who knew a bit about the science they're reporting.
