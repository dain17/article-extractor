They don‚Äôt base their hunting of prey based on sight, they base it off of the Ampullea of Lorenzini, which are receptors that determine a change in the current, electric field that is disrupted by another electric field produced by prey! That is the simplest explanation, but don‚Äôt expect many to understand! This is why when a shark attacks it is considered mistaken identity! That is also why they let go, because we lack the fat that can sustain their needs! You have to respect the environment that belongs to them when entering the water, plus you have to remind yourself that you swim at your own risk! Hope this gentleman makes a full recovery and will have an awesome shark attack story to tell his friends at the bar! Just look at Bethany Hamilton, she lost her arm in a shark attack but was asking when she could get back in the water just days after her attack! She didn‚Äôt let her tragedy prevent her from competing in the surfing circuit!",

One thing that most of these experts(?) tell us repeatedly, is how we are more likely to be struck by lightning that bitten by a shark. I doubt that to be true.  The other thing we hear a lot about is how endangered many sharks species are and how we have to protect the poor creatures.  Other experts tell us that we really don't much about sharks, including how many there really are.  Experts tell us that sharks have been around for millions of years, even before the dinosaurs in many cases. Now all of a sudden, they are endangered? Sounds like a bit of Democrat Party  politics at work here. Shark experts love to remind us that sharks unintentionally attack people due to mistaken identify. The idea being proposed is that they sometimes think we are seals. Truth is, they don't know that to be fact.  Personally, I believe that if you have a hungry shark in the water and you happen to be in that shark's direction of travel, that shark doesn't care whether or you are a seal or a smiling mermaid. The fact is, that shark is hungry and he wants to eat you, plain and simple.",

You could walk about 200yds offshore and never get more than ankle deep in water because of the reef. Then you sat down, put on your flippers, goggles and rolled into the water. We would fish for things along the reef to cook on the beach. Was warned to not venture away from the reef because of Hammerheads, Makos and Tiger Sharks. I rolled into the water one time and came face to face with the larges Tiger Shark I'd ever seen in my life. That think came by like a train and was only inches away. I can't remember much other than thinking to myself there was no way I could beat that if it wanted to eat me. The water was maybe 30' deep so I didn't want to risk it coming back at me from behind or underneath so back up on the reef I went and we had hamburgers that day.",
