East Coast residents will have the chance to watch a NASA rocket launch from Virginia at about 7 a.m. ET Tuesday, the space agency said in a statement.

The statement said the Northrop Grumman rocket, the Minotaur 1, will take off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. NASA said the rocket will carry three national security payloads for the National Reconnaissance Office. Spaceflight Now tweeted that the launch has been delayed due to storms in the area.

The rocket should be visible from New York City about 30 to 60 seconds after lift-off. It could also be visible to residents of western Pennsylvania, eastern Long Island, Massachusetts and southern Vermont about 60 to 90 seconds after launch.

The U.S. Space Force Space and Missile Systems Center’s Launch Enterprise will coordinate the launch.
