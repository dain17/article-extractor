Gee, if only the chicoms had the ability to shoot down a satellite, now would be a great opportunity to apply that technology.  It'd be kind of cool if the US tracked this junk well enough to plot its re-entry and then hit it with our own kinetic weapon .... just to put a thumb-in-the-eye of the CCP.

The only one that does is Fox News. \nChina launched knowing they could not control its reentry and nothing happens in China if its president for life does not know about it first. If the rocket crashes on a heavily populated metropolitan area killing hundreds if not thousands of innocent people, what are they going to say, oops, sorry? That should be enough to bring its president for life to the ICC in The Hague and charged with crimes against humanity. Likely that will not happen though, since China has such a strong and strangely inexplicable control over the U.N. \nAs you can see, I am a bit angry about this one.

Because the project represented the next step toward wider space exploration, NASA threw itself into successfully putting Skylab in orbit. Unfortunately, the agency spent far less time and energy planning how to gracefully bring the space station back to Earth at the end of its mission. Even though Skylab was devised for just a nine-year lifespan, NASA failed to build in any control or navigation mechanisms to return the orbiter to terra firma. Doing so would have “cost too much,” administrator Robert Frosch said at the time. \nThis lack of preparation presented a problem in late 1978, when NASA engineers discovered the station’s orbit was decaying rapidly. Skylab had become a 77-ton loose cannon.",
