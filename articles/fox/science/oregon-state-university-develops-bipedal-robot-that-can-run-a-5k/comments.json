Mankind is in deep trouble, no mark that, DEEP TROUBLE, if we thin a robot will lead to fulfilment living life.  Fulfillment is not found in robots, or other such nonsense.  While robots may be useful, there is no way to connect the dots between robots and fulfillment.  Fulfillment hinges of an understanding of meaning and purpose.  Sadly, many people today have no clue about meaning and purpose.  \n\nProf Marston of New York University recently did a survey.  He asked 3,000 people, â€œWhat have you to live for?\"  94% were enduring the present, hoping for something in the future. They had no substance on what they were hoping for.  \n\nWith 94% only enduring, meaning and purpose, (hence fulfillment) was beyond their reach.  No robot will make the 94%, 50%, or 25%.  When we search the wrong places, we cannot expect to find answers.",

I had a long career based in technology.  What was done with this bi-ped is amazing and well intentioned.  But, adding fulfillment, ... no, not at all.   Some of the least fulfilled people I know are deep into technology.  Recall my comment about looking in the wrong places....?\n\nRemember, when the personal computer began an upswing, mid-80s?  Consider what Ken Olson said regarding PCs. The goal was to make things easier so that people would have \"more time to do what they wanted to do.\"  Remember when cell phones first came to the market, \"... make life easier.\"  How many people are slaves to this technology in 2021?  What happened to all the relief of time, \"to do what you want to do?\"",
