The isotopic dating techniques used to date the earth and its rocks are so full of tenuous assumptions as to be meaningless, unless you are bent on \"proving\" Darwinian macroevolution. Some of these assumptions are:\nThe proportion of \"parent\" and \"daughter\" isotopes were known when the rock was formed.\nNone of the \"parent\" or \"daughter\" materials entered or escaped the rock in question during the \"millions of years\" it existed.\nThe rate of radioactive decay remained constant throughout the specimen's life.\nThere are other assumptions involved as well. The bottom line: when volcanically formed rocks known to be only 2 - 20 years old are tested by the dating labs, the results routinely \"show\" them to be hundreds of thousands of years old. This has been documented scores of times.\n\nFossils are found in sedimentary rock - they were buried with dirt and rocks washed over the animal bodies during a violent flood. It is impossible to know the age of the fossils themselves from the surrounding rocks.\n\nThe Bible doesn't use the word, \"dinosaur\", because it wasn't coined yet. Look at the verses on the behemoth and it is a good description of a sauropod. The description of the leviathon could be about mosasaurs or other extinct aquatic reptiles. Similarly, dragons may refer to extinct flying reptiles such as pterodactyls.",

That‚Äôs your faith thats right your faith. I believe in God you don‚Äôt thats a fact. Just because you do not believe in something does not make it go away. Now going back to the simple question. You will never ever answer that question . It has everything to do with the article. Because it‚Äôs dating that‚Äôs in question so you have to go to the resources they are using Carbon 12-13-14. It‚Äôs a fact ( please go on the Internet) it will go in detail how it‚Äôs accurate up to about 5000 years.all the articles say anything after that is questionable ( guessing). That right guessing. I know science . I look at both sides of a coin and the facts all point to a creator hands down. Yes you have been misled by scientists who use their positions to miss lead people on purpose to further their own agendas to make name for themselves , fame and money",
