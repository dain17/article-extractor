Do fossil fuels pollute the earth, it appears so, but will switching even a substantial portion of the world to green vehicles stop or reverse the existing climate change, again speculation says yes.\n\nThere is a lot of speculation on climate change, very little scientific proof.

Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500¬∞ C (932¬∞ F) to 2,000¬∞ C (3,632¬∞ F) or higher.A thermometer in the thermosphere will register below 0C because the hot \nCO2 and NO2 molecules are so sparse they can‚Äôt make up for energy loss from the thermometer bulb.During solar storms, CO2 and NO2 in the thermosphere act like an energy shield\n to protect the Earth. The human eye can see wavelengths between .38 and\n .70 microns, making it possible to see light shows like the aurora \nborealis, which is higher up in the magnetosphere and driven by electrons and protons not photons.(Above written by an engineer, didn't keep name, old tidbit of research.)",

But occasionally, a star will inexplicably begin to overheat, followed by a premature explosion and death. Our sun may be overheating prematurely. The whole climate change/global warming rhetoric is just a distraction from the scientific community and governments of the world to keep the population from panicking. It's a way to try to explain the changes in temperature and climate patterns that people have been noticing. If we are led to believe that these changes are man-caused, that gives us some sense of control, makes us believe that we can fix it. Those extra long and lingering \"contrails\" we've all noticed, but were too embarrassed to admit to noticing, were a way to buy us some time by putting up a reflective shield of aluminum, barium, or silver particles. That program was very expensive, so it was largely scaled back. We were all told that they were typical contrails, but those of us who have been around a while knew that they looked nothing like the contrails from our childhood. The program reached its highest point of activity during the Obama administration, and then those new types of  strange \"contrails\" seemed to magically disappear on January 20th 2016, and have only occasionally been seen since. Of course real contrails are still frequently seen; those short, quickly dissipating, vapor trails that follow jet aircraft.",
