I remember one President thinking that scientists could inject disinfectant into the human body.  Oh, oh, oh, and this President told his treasury Secretary to print money in the tune of 1.5 trillion dollars and prop the securities.  Yeah, economists then predicted inflation would come like we have not seen since the 70s.  Wait this President pushed through a tax reform bill that permanently gave tax benefits to the ultra wealthy but for the average family their benefits would last until 2025.  Wait wait this tax. Reform adds 1 trillion to our deficit on an annual bases.  \nWow this President was something that much is very true. ",

Jesus was not trying to teach a science class, but was making a theological (philosophical) point. If the audience understood his point, then his analogy was successful, regardless of it's scientific accuracy. When Jesus says a mustard seed is the \"smallest of seeds\" his listeners understand that it is very small but grows into a large tree..\nOn a cloudless morning, do say \"the Sun has risen\"? Does anyone call you a liar? According to Copernicus, the Earth turns, the Sun does not rise.  I do not think you are new to the English language, or even to human languages but if your determined to disparage the Christian Bible, I'm quite certain you can find a way.\nWhat I'd like to know is not about bats and birds or mustard tree seeds but rather, how will you account for your sins when you leave this Earth and are brought before God, your Judge? He knows everything you've ever done or even thought. There are no secrets with Him and there are no shortcomings in His justice. The wages for sinning against the infinite God are infinite punishment. Unless you have a way of escape, you will pay in full.\nSometimes you focus on the stupidest things. (Oh, wait.

Have they become multi-cellular? \nLet me teach you about the Lenski experiment. E. coli already have in their DNA code for proteins to aerobically process citrate but those sequences are regulated \"off\" in the wild because they are not chemically/energetically economical for the bacteria, so those DNA sequences are regulated \"off\" in wild e. coli bacteria – they are a handicap. Why should the bacteria waste molecules making proteins they don't need? However, in Petri dishes with controlled growth media that includes citrate, these DNA sequences can become regulated \"on,\" allowing for the production of proteins to process citrate. No new information has been acquired by the bacteria. They have simply stopped turning off the code they already had. There is no evolution taking place – only adaptation that was programmed into the bacteria by their Creator. They certainly are not a new species. They are still bacteria and in particular, they are still e. coli.\nSo, what have you got, ScienceGal? Ya got nothin'. Go, learn the details of the Lenski experiment.\nStop calling yourself \"ScienceGal.\" You don't think like a scientist, you don't talk like a scientist, and your general knowledge of science is very weak. Many microbiologists believe in God because they recognize elements of design in cells. Cells are simply amazing – all cells.",

Many of those common human traits and characteristics - anger, love, compassion, hate, grief, jealousy - are seen in the Bible as characteristics of God. He, of course, goes beyond as He is perfect, holy, righteous, and vengeant. There is nothing in the Bible that tells us that we will \"create\" anything - something that is uniquely in God's domain and His domain only. If one understands that \"getting right with God\" is all about establishing a personal relationship with Him, then one can see what is the importance of being created \"in His image\", .i.e., like Him. How would we \"relate\" to Him if we did not share similar characteristics?",

Per Wiki, JWT has the capability to see light that was generated 13.6 billion years ago.  Why not build a telescope that sees light generated 13.77 billion years ago?  The gap seems suspiciously close, e.g., like they intentionally don’t want the data.  Seems like it might provide irrefutable proof that a Big Bang event occurred, e.g., that there is no visible light beyond a point and it doesn’t matter what direction you look.  No, I’m not an astronomer, just a taxpayer, like millions of others, who play a small role funding this project.",

Chapter 2, verse 4  uses day as a longer period of time.  \"This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.\"   Gerald Schroeder and Hugh Ross have expanded explanations on the meaning of \"day\", if you are interested. \nHow did the 3500 year old Genesis chapter 1 get all these steps, placed in the correct order, when there is no other holy book or science book of any age that even get close?\n• George Smoot, Nobel Prize Physicist : “There is no doubt that a parallel exists between the big bang as an event and the Christian notion of creation from nothing. … Until the late 1910’s humans were as ignorant of cosmic origins as they had ever been. Those who didn’t take Genesis literally had no reason to believe there had been a beginning.”\n• Robert Jastrow (Agnostic cosmologist, director of NASA): “the essential element in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis is the same; the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply, at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.” “For the [non-believing] scientist who has lived by faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.\"",

Then we discovered molecules are made of atoms.  Then we discovered atoms are made of neutrons, protons and electrons (and morons....just kidding...btw why can't you trust atoms? Because they make up everything!)  Anyway, then we discovered quarks actually make up protons and neutrons,   I DK about electrons, I believe the current thoughts are they are quantum particles with zero mass and zero dimensions . \nThat gets me to my second question:  What happened \"before\" the big bang?  My personal belief is absolutely nothing, not even time  itself existed before the BB.  What gets me is what triggered the BB?  According to Neil deGrasse Tyson (I think) he said, as many others have that the universe was an infinitesimally tiny particle of unimaginable density/mass.  Then  I believe he said, \"an instability kicked in, causing the BB\".  I thought, well that's handy to create a new universe. But it's hard to believe. If time didn't exist before the  BB.  Wouldn't the BB have occurred instantly as soon as the particle was formed?   \nWe need to keep an open mind, who knows what else we'll discover?  God himself? Intelligent design (but not \"God\"), the oscillating universe theory being confirmed?  Lots left to learn. ",

Improvident habits, \nslovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist \nwherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism \ndeprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. \nThe fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - \neither as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery \nuntil the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. \nThousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die \nbut the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. \nNo stronger retrograde force exists in the world. \nFar from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. \nIt has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; \nand were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science \nagainst which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, \nas fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.\n - Sir Winston Churchill \n(The River War, First Edition, Vol. II, pages 248-50 (London: Longmans, Green | 1899 ",

It probably should. You're getting high school level science wrong after all.\nAs stated, abiogenesis is not a theory because we don't know which of two major steps came first and until we do, it will not be a theory. If tomorrow one of the two models was found to be accurate, we might then have a theory of abiogenesis, but even then it would take years and years of work and verification.\nYes I'm aware that you understand the topics on a creationist level, as in less than high school, but those of us in the field of biology know that abiogenesis and spontaneous generation are not the same thing, don't describe the same thing, and are not even remotely in the ballpark of being related.\nEvolution does show that humans were not 'specially created' but evolved over time, fossils and genetics demonstrate this, and some Christians accept that, others do not :-)",

The only way to make that happen is to have a light source really far away or have a machine that generates parallel light rays.

Those pictures aren’t in red light.\nIn any pictures with divergent shadows, you can see a light source brought to the moon. \nIf the shots were on a sound stage you’d expect all the shadows to be divergent in the direction of the source light ans.
