The fakery actually began in 1958 shortly after Naca (pre-curser to Nasa) and the Soviets confirmed that hypersonic re-entry is impossible to survive because you simply vaporize as do meteors. Re-entry temperatures were documented to be \"hotter than the surface of the sun\" and posed a major problem for engineers to successfully \"land\" a vehicle through what they described as a \"thermal thicket\". Ablation was the answer and it was 'on with the show'.. (i.e. cargo plane drops).\n\nThe Shuttle was remote controlled, launched from the Cape and landed in Baikonur. Then 're-launched' via the AN-225 (specifically designed for this), and piloted back to Edwards or the Cape at high altitude and Mach 2-3 for the sonic boom - thrusters off then 'glided' in for a landing. The trick worked like a champ..",

The shuttle never reentered, it flew at high alt. at supersonic. The 'shooting star' effect was created by the contrail of the rockets - that's clearly seen in right conditions at night. In addition, the TPS system did not 'ablate' so therefore it would not develop a 'streak' of light (nor would plasma leave a 'trail').\n\nBack to the Columbia supersonic disaster - Carefully study the vid as it was spotted before the breakup (no trail). It became a 'shooting star' afterward and was clearly moving at supersonic, not the alleged hypersonic velocity of 12,000mph at the time when it turned into a fireball.\n\nThe last shuttle 'reentry' recorded was Atlantis, and you can clearly see that it left a contrail streak by the rockets. That was all part of the show..\n\nAgain, hypersonic reentry is impossible because you vaporize. Period.\nHuman 'spaceflight' is the grandest scientific fraud in history.",

I think it‚Äôs all hype. \n\nApparently, even a sample of Martian soil is too much to ask for. That movie, ‚ÄúMartian‚Äù was a real joke. At least a little bit of real science is being done on the space station. Plus we get a few nice pictures of home. \n\nThe 50th anniversary of the last step on the Moon is coming up soon. Also the last time any man was above ‚Äúlow Earth orbit.‚Äù  So much for ‚Äúreaching for the stars.‚Äù Sorry, millennials. It‚Äôs not looking good. You‚Äôll just have to enjoy your CGI and VR. It was my generation that produced Star Trek and Moon landings. (And the space station and the Voyagers.)",

(December 17, 2021.) Do you really want to talk about going to Mars? 12 people have walked on the Moon and now nothing for 50 years. We haven't even gone beyond low Earth orbit in 50 years.\n\nMars?
