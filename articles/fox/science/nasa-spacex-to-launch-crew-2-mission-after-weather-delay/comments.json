Maybe if someone saves this and remembers it years from now it might help science a bit. \n\nBack in 1993 I was on my way home from work driving up Interstate 5 in California from LA County back to Bakersfield in Kern County in the early morning hours. As I climbed the Grapevine in my pickup I'm naturally looking up due to the climb up the mountain. Now here's an example of the best way I can describe what I saw and it lasted for over a minute. \n\nTake a photo of a blue sky with very little to no cloud cover. Carefully rip a hole in the center of the picture so that it has somewhat jagged edges instead of being just round. Now take a picture of a clear night sky with lots of stars and no moon showing any light. Place that picture behind the day sky picture so the stars can be seen through the hole. Now add in the Hollywood distortion affect used to represent a cloaked ship in Star Trek in the night photo.\n\nBest way I can describe it. Maybe someone else has seen it before now too. Save this for posterity and you never know what can come of it. I've only seen this phenomenon once in my life.\n\nJohn Campbell",
