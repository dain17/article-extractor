So it's not just about the impact but other gravitational forces as well. These miniscule shifts provide large magnitudes of course trajectory when you consider the VAST volume of space and distance out there. Think about the impact of a bullet over a mile away by shifting the barrel of a rifle ever so slightly. The results are significant and even more astounding when you're talking about 6.8 million miles ( approximate distance from Earth to Dimorphos at time of impact).",

The purpose of DART is to provide just enough kinetic impact (it's traveling about 4.1 miles PER SECOND) so that Dimorphos' orbital period around Didymos is slightly changed, pulling Dimorphos slightly closer to the latter. So it's not just about the impact but other gravitational forces as well. These miniscule shifts provide large magnitudes of course changes when you consider the VAST volume of space and distance out there. Think about the impact of a bullet over a mile away by shifting the barrel of a rifle ever so slightly. The results are huge.\n\nPlease educate yourself before making your type of comments.
