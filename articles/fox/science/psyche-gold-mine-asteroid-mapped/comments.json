Then, from there, smaller and shorter trips could be used to bring materials to Earth. Only a single ton of material would be extremely valuable and I'm sure they can figure out how to get multiple tons back to Earth per trip. They currently can carry 70 tons from Earth to space in a single trip. It says online that they can carry 18.5 tons to Mars already. Imagine multiple 18.5 ton trips from 16 Psyche to the moon and 5 or so ton trips between the moon and the Earth. The missions would basically be paying for themselves many times over. They wouldn't be bringing the whole rock back. They would mine for valuable metals and bring that back.",

The first version, which appears in the original 1977 film Star Wars, is stated to be more than 160 kilometers (99 mi) in diameter, and is crewed by an estimated 1.7 million military personnel and 400,000 droids. The second Death Star appears in Return of the Jedi, and is significantly larger at 200 kilometres (120 mi) in diameter and, although unfinished, is technologically more advanced than its predecessor.",
