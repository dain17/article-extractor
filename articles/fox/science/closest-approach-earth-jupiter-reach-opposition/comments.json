But I've gotten to know a lot of the people who frequent the science section, so get more casual with a post like the one that started this thread, as a conversation among friends.\nI can hardly be \"partisan\" in that I no longer support any American political party. You might not like my honest conservative views, but what was once the GOP I embraced has been dying for decades. It is hard to tell, as the last good GOP president was George HW Bush -- and even that is hard to judge because I was living overseas during his presidency. I voted for his son, but was not impressed most of the time. And Congress declined as well, with Republicans, like Democrats, putting party before country. I really miss the Howard Bakers that used to make Congress shine. And, yes, you might not like that I see Trump as the presidential force that nailed the coffin shut in the GOP, and that the Party of Lincoln no longer exists. But that is my long-term perspective.\nAs for Covid, the only things I've written about that come straight from the scientific literature, and certainly not from politics.\nThank you for your interest in following my \"historical comments\" on this outlet. Perhaps you'd like to read more of my writing by checking out one of my published books, two of which are aimed at a general audience with scientific interests.\nHappy autumnal equinox, today at 9:03 pm ET.",

In fact, the more they learn about how life works (which they can learn from life that actually exists now) the further they seem to be from coming up with any idea how life could have begun spontaneously. Without life, no biological evolution takes place. By the theory you believe, you can‚Äôt exist. \n\nIn the ‚Äútree of life‚Äù (taxonomic tree) images, the vast majority of branch nodes are question marks. Only end points of branches show actual known creatures. The fossil beds contain the remnants of millions of creatures buried suddenly in sedimentary (flood created) layers all over the Earth. The same layers are found over vast areas of every continent. Your interpretation of the fossil record is wrong. There was a global flood, just as it is written in Genesis. \n\nYou reject God‚Äôs Word which is inspired by God‚Äôs Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1.21). You blaspheme the Holy Spirit. Genesis is no allegory. There is nothing in the text to indicate it is allegory. Jesus treats as historical. Peter and Paul and Luke treat it as historical. \n\nDo you also think the resurrection of Jesus Christ is allegory? It certainly seems to violate known scientific laws. \n\nWhy would you exchange the narrative given by God for a narrative invented by godless men?",

The Earth was created for Man ‚Äì not Jupiter or any of its moons.\n\nThe stage, the Earth, was built for the narrative. The props were set up ‚Äì the oceans, the mountains, the trees, the lights in the heavens, the sea creatures and animals ‚Äì and last of all, the main actors, Mankind, were put here and the play began. The hero of the narrative, Jesus Christ, came on the scene and gave the most compelling performance ‚Äì the King giving his life for his subjects and then rising from the dead. Very soon it will be time for the lead performer to return to the scene and finally conquer all of his enemies ... in my opinion, less than 100 years.\n\nWhen Jesus has conquered all of his enemies, this portion of the play will be over. The stage will no longer be needed and will be uncreated far more quickly than it was created.\n\n\"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens a new earth in which righteousness dwells.\" 2Pet 3",

Prior to that, the previous record low was set in October 1963, with an elevation of 4191.35, rounded to 4191.4 to conform with data reporting formats of the time and a recorded size of 950 square miles.\n\nThat was about 60 years ago.  The last time Jupiter was this close to the earth.\n\nCould the earth just be going though natural cycles with the cycles of the planets?",
