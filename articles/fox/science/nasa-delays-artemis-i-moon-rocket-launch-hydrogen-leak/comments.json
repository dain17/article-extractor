The Artemis program has an enormously bloated budget, which includes high dollar federal contracts to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and yes, even SpaceX. Yet, there have been a load of production & quality delays from Boeing, and now we have launch delays with this controversial program due to leaks and engine issues which should have been addressed at the vehicle assembly building, and not on the launch pad. Do not be surprised if they have to slowly wheel this \"big boy\" back to the assembly building.\n\nOh, Zephram Cochrane, where R U???",
