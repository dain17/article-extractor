Something definitely happened say 10,000/12,000 years ago and ancient cultures definitely hint at that. Maybe we're livestock but Darwin was wrong.  There is some base of truth in religion.  You don't have to believe it all,  maybe Jesus knew where the rocks were when he walked on water,  maybe Moses just happened to cross at low tide.  Where is the actual physical evolution since ancient times?  Because we fly planes around and nonsensically tweet our every move isn't exactly evolution. Have you seen the democratic party?  If anything humans as we call ourselves are de-evolving. We're definitely in the decline of civilization.

This allowed a MUCH wider range of noises humans could make, and a much wider frequency range.  This allowed the development of powerful languages, instead of mostly grunts.  Around 15,000-8000 years ago there was a mutation in the brain that allowed people sense pitch and other characteristics, and also much better sense of rhythm.

There should be no useful DNA left after 40,000 years. \n\nDenisovans and Neanderthals are just other ethnicities of humans. As a species, we come in many shapes and sizes. \n\nThus the lies are perpetuated. Lies about ages. Lies about ancestry.",
