Everyone has experienced a business receipt that smears and smudges. This ink is what gets onto our skin and is absorbed by the body.\n\nPlastic bottles also have a serious issue with BPA and BPS. UV rays (sunlight) breaks down the molecular bond and the BPA/BPS leeches into the containers contents (water, soda, milk) and we slurp it down.\n\nDon't use plastic drinking or eating vessels. \nDon't EVER put plastic into a microwave!\nDon't leave plastic drinking containers in your gym bag or worse left in your car.\n\nStainless steel is our best option right now. Its fairly lightweight for shipping, lasts a long time, is highly recyclable and has little to no chemical leeching properties. Aluminum is a solid second choice for storage or drinking vessels, as it can be recycled virtually forever without degrading, minimal health concerns when kept cool, but there are leeching concerns when aluminum is used in high heat situations - like those cheap aluminum cooking pans.",
