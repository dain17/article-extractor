A snipit from the JPL/NASA website:\n\n'Ingenuity features four specially made carbon-fiber blades, arranged into two rotors that spin in opposite directions at around 2,400 rpm - many times faster than a passenger helicopter on Earth. It also has innovative solar cells, batteries, and other components. Ingenuity doesn't carry science instruments and is a separate experiment from the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover.\n\nWhat makes it hard for a helicopter to fly on Mars? For one thing, Mars' thin atmosphere makes it difficult to achieve enough lift. Because the Mars atmosphere is 99% less dense than Earth's, Ingenuity has to be light, with rotor blades that are much larger and spin much faster than what would be required for a helicopter of Ingenuity's mass on Earth.\n\nIt can also be bone-chillingly cold at Jezero Crater, where Perseverance will land with Ingenuity attached to its belly in February 2021. Nights there dip down to minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius). While Ingenuity's team on Earth has tested the helicopter at Martian temperatures and believes it should work on Mars as intended, the cold will push the design limits of many of Ingenuity's parts.'",

In my opinion, this is easily the most impressive mars development since they landed that first rover in the 1990s but it would still be a lot more impressive if it was actually manned.  I'd be interested to know more about the helicopter's limitations, like how high, far & fast it will be able to travel through the skies of Mars before it needs to recharge, this story was a bit light on the info like that.  \n\nNow we have to wait for a Martian to come up out of his underground cave & start shooting a shotgun at this thing in his boxer shorts.   At which point, we will be able to tell just how much we really have in common with the Martians.  \n\nIt'd be cool if they could just drop similar helicopters right out of orbit to fly around the planet's surface, even cooler if they were able send them back up into orbit to be collected & dropped again wherever/whenever they wanted to.  Even with the current setup though, it should help to drastically expedite the exploration of Mars, maybe even find something that's worth spending billions of dollars to find.  Preferably something that has more value than just scientific value because until we find something that's worth commercializing, we're not going to be going too much farther or faster than we have since the 1960s.
