A few days later, something that looked like a shiny, silver, metallic, hourglass on its side just hovered over my front lawn for 15 mins. I ran to show my father but once I got his attention of course it was gone. I don't recall ever seeing anything quite like that again. My grandfather and uncle were on the Mulberry river in Arkansas and they witnessed what they called a fireball, as big as a house, come down out of the sky and skimmed across the water.

A couple of times I see a light in the sky traveling at a speed like the space station would do but it was going the opposite direction, then it stopped and darted off at incredible speed the complete opposite direction it was traveling at first.

This one is just extraordinarily difficult to test. But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. For example, in 1871 Charles Darwin \"speculated\" that human ancestors evolved in Africa, based upon our morphological similarities to the African hominoidea. That was basically an hypothesis, first confirmed by fossil evidence, and then further confirmed by genetic evidence.\nYou hit upon a good point, though, when you wrote that we \"can't possibly even imagine all the variations that might exist out there.....\" True, but we know the possibilities are endless. Life outside Earth need not have a basis in anything similar to our genetic system other than self reproducibility.\nAs 'Bones' put it, \"It's life Jim, but not as we know it.",

For all we know, it could have required a super extraordinary coincidence to set up that basic mechanism which itself is the basis for evolution.\n\nWe have not found evidence that life started more than once on earth, which might have been evident from, say, different encoding methods.  All life on earth uses essentially the same codon table to manufacture proteins.\n\nSaying that trillions of earth-like planets in billions of galaxies likely have amino acids floating around doesn't overcome this difficulty.  It leaves us with NO reasonable statement about if life is likely very abundant in the universe, or if life would rarely even appear at all in a universe like ours, as it's not clear that our big bang universe is the only time it evern happened.
