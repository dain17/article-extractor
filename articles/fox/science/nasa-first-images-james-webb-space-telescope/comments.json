You got the Periodic Table which introduces us to the gang of 118 and tells us a little bit about their personalities but there’s nothing anywhere in that table that’s going to get us to to Alpha Centauri, the closest solar system to ours, just over 4 light years away, in any of our lifetimes. We can send unmanned, interplanetary rocket drones to what we think is a Blue Planet in the Alpha Centauri gravitational bound system as a way to let them know that we heard the phone ringing, but it won’t arrive there for at least a hundred thousand years. We can show them how to get here but you know what? Let’s not even bother. For some reason we never named our solar system, probably do to our low self image.",

Gagarin never ‘orbited’ or re-entered the atmosphere at hypersonic in that comical Vostok cannonball- and “bailed out” to safety with a parachute.. \n\nPrior to all of these alleged ‘space flight’ stunts, it was confirmed that hypersonic re-entry is impossible because of rapid vaporization. NO material could, can or ever will be able to ‘survive’ the heat, which was documented- by NASA- to be 100,000 deg. F.\n\nPerhaps now you can understand that NASA and the CCP are/were ONE organization formed to con the masses. The Chinese are also part of the global con, even though their fakery is deplorable.\n\nBTW the moon does reflect energy. This was also well known prior to Apollo.

Science has as its goal discovering the laws which govern the universe; religion reminds us of the identity of the lawgiver. Laws do not come into being on their own. And laws of the universe are the products of a divine intellect.\nJoseph H. Taylor, Jr., Nobel Prize winner in Physics for the discovery of the first known binary pulsar, and for his work which supported the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe, said, “A scientific discovery is also a religious discovery. There is no conflict between science and religion. Our knowledge of God is made larger with every discovery we make about the world.”",

Albert Einstein disagreed. “The more I study science, the more I believe in God,” he is reported to have said. Science has as its goal discovering the laws which govern the universe; religion reminds us of the identity of the lawgiver. Laws do not come into being on their own. And laws of the universe are the products of a divine intellect.\nJoseph H. Taylor, Jr., Nobel Prize winner in Physics for the discovery of the first known binary pulsar, and for his work which supported the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe, said, “A scientific discovery is also a religious discovery. There is no conflict between science and religion. Our knowledge of God is made larger with every discovery we make about the world.”",

Gagarin never ‘orbited’ or re-entered the atmosphere at hypersonic in that comical Vostok cannonball- and “bailed out” to safety with a parachute.. \n\nPrior to all of these alleged ‘space flight’ stunts, it was confirmed that hypersonic re-entry is impossible because of rapid vaporization. NO material could, can or ever will be able to ‘survive’ the heat, which was documented- by NASA- to be 100,000 deg. F.\n\nPerhaps now you can understand that NASA and the CCP are/were ONE organization formed to con the masses. The Chinese are also part of the global con, even though their fakery is deplorable.\n\nBTW the moon does reflect energy. This was also well known prior to Apollo. And to think that anyone has equipment with the capability to “hit” a tiny reflector on the  moon, is asinine.",

So they are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.

Instead, his understanding of God as (1) the source and sustainer of mathematically describable order in the universe and (2) the intelligent designer of living systems and the solar system actually inspired his scientific endeavor. The Principia was a theologically inspired mathematical treatise in which Newton sought to bring glory to God by discovering, as its title indicates, the \"mathematical principles\" that governed the universe. Similarly, Newton’s conviction in the intelligibility of nature led him to investigate how natural systems work, so that he could appreciate and bear witness to their ingenious design. For Newton, postulating divine action as part of his natural philosophy was anything but a science stopper.

You got the Periodic Table which introduces us to the gang of 118 and tells us a little bit about their personalities but there’s nothing anywhere in that table that’s going to get us to to Alpha Centauri, the closest solar system to ours, just over 4 light years away, in any of our lifetimes. We can send unmanned, interplanetary rocket drones to what we think is a Blue Planet in the Alpha Centauri gravitational bound system as a way to let them know that we heard the phone ringing, but it won’t arrive there for at least a hundred thousand years. We can show them how to get here but you know what? Let’s not even bother. For some reason we never named our solar system, probably do to our low self image.",
