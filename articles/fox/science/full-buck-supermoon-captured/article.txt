Stunning images were captured around the world of July's full buck supermoon on Wednesday night. 

Shots of the celestial event were captured in Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Iraq and Wisconsin. 

In some photos, the rising supermoon appeared with an orange tint. 

Also known as the thunder moon and the hay or mead moon, NASA said the moon would appear full through Friday morning.

The supermoon's closer proximity to Earth can make it appear slightly bigger and brighter.

The buck moon was named by the Algonquin tribes of the northeastern U.S. 

Early summer is normally the time when the new antlers of buck deer come out of their foreheads. 

The tribes also called this the thunder moon due to the summer's frequent thunderstorms.

Europeans called this the hay moon, for haymaking, and sometimes the mead moon. 

The supermoon on June 14 was the "strawberry moon," because it is the full moon at strawberry harvest time.
