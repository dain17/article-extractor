This guy was nuts, the Black Mamba is not only one of the most venomous snakes in the world and makes a rattlesnake seems like child play, but it is possibly the most aggressive snake in the world.  Unlike most venomous snakes that would prefer to leave the area if you don't bother them, the Black Mamba will actually chase you.  It is very territorial, it does not need to be threatened.  In the wild, it can stake out a territory the size of a football field as its own, any human that steps into that football field sized area will most likely be tracked down and killed.  I doubt that we even have anti-venom in the United States close enough to this guys residence.  A human will die with almost 100% certainty within 30 minutes to 3 hours.
