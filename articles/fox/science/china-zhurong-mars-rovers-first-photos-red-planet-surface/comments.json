Consequently, I would expect any efforts to bring charges that stick will be delayed until after Trump has passed. Just spit-balling.\n\nThe resumes of any of these figures absolutely destroys Joe Biden's credentials. And it's not even close. All three understand how to work. Biden understands how to profit exclusively and only from other people's work and taking credit for himself. And sure, Trump's exploitation of the Central Park rink's contractors was terrible.

Yet the government seems to think they know better and go to extreme efforts to control thought.  If you disagree with them, you are imprisoned and/or executed.  It frustrates me that we in the US buy so much from China.  The profits from these purchases have funded their military and their space program.  And in time, I believe both will be used against us.  With that said, currently their technology is not equal to ours.  However through intellectual property theft, that is quickly changing.  Frankly, the Chinese leadership are not to be trusted.
