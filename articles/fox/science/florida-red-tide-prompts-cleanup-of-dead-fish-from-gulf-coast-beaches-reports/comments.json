This one began in 2017 and, over the past few months, has slowly ballooned into a nightmare scenario for residents and business owners — not to mention the thousands of animals that have died.\nThere are several ways human activity can exacerbate a bloom, but the main culprit is allowing nitrogen-rich material such as fertilizer to run off into natural water sources. The same fertilizer that helps sugar cane, tomatoes and corn grow in the Sunshine State feeds algae when it reaches the ocean.\nHumans are also playing a role by driving up global temperatures via greenhouse gas emissions. In a letter published by the journal Environmental Science & Technology, researchers at the University of Florida and the University of North Carolina said that “climate change will severely affect our ability to control blooms, and in some cases could make it near impossible.”\nAs air and ocean temperatures increase, the environment becomes more hospitable to toxic algal blooms in several ways, according to scientists and the Environmental Protection Agency.\" - WaPo (2018)\n\nBy the way, how's the coast in Turkey looking lately?  Mucilage?  Meh..",

That's the present day problem.\n\nBig Agra all over the developed world does the same. The Great  Barrier Reef is being overrun by crown-of-thorn starfish because their natural predators have been slowly destroyed by farming runoffs. Shoreline golf courses in Hawaii pollute the coral reefs with their fertilizer runoffs destroying everything in conjunction with ACC, bleaching, fishing line and plastic.\nCan all this be managed? One way is to increase the cost of consumables so that waste management is built in to the price instead of socializing the cost by just dumping it in the air water and land. Simple economics in a global economy doesn't work well though. That's why you see SE Asian fishing boats strip mining the Atlantic ocean, oil companies destroying the Arctic, South American and African jungles to extract oil, etc.",

However, the real reason the Gulf Coast is experiencing these massive fish kills is man made. Yes, red tide is naturally occurring, but add man made fertilizers to it and it becomes red tide on steroids. This is caused by run-off from Mosaic Fertilizer, Big Sugar, old septic systems and poor water management. This article fails to mention the health risks to humans from the Cyanobacteria, brevotoxins and microcystins red tide creates. For years this has been Floridas dirty BIG secret, swept under the rug to protect the tourist industry. The CDC has finally started to investigate the harmful effects and the links to Alzheimer’s, ALS and non-alcoholic liver disease from these toxins which have been found airborne, as far as, 10 miles away from their source. The 11 tons of carnage removed from southwest Florida beaches in 2018 was horrific, it is finally being acknowledged. Hallelujah Fox News! Send the water South out of Okeechobee. Stop the spraying. Marine lives matter. Human lives matter. ",
