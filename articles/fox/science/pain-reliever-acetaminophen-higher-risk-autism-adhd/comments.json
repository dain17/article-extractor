Every generation sees headlines about the results of health studies, many change their lifestyles to protect themselves, then we find out the study was wrong, and the changes were pointless, or even harmful. \n\nHave you ever read the study which said salt causes heart disease? It is one of the most absurd things ever written, yet to this day, doctors recommend a low-salt diet. \n\nThe study looked at heart disease fatalities by salt intake. Central Africans ate the least salt, and almost none of them died of heart disease. Southern Europeans at the most salt, and had the most heart disease fatalities. The problem is that the median life expectancy in Central Africa was only 34 years when the study was conducted, no one there lived long enough to get heart disease. The country with the highest salt intake, which is Japan, also has the longest median life expectancy.\n\nThe study induced heart disease in rats with high levels of salt. The amount needed was the same you would get from eating 100 McDonald‚Äôs hamburgers per day, every day, for months. Any less, and there was no risk increase. Indeed, we now find low salt diets increase heart disease fatality rates.",

Andrew Wakefield (who published the only paper demonstrating a link) only had 12 total children in the study and was retracted because he handpicked children who would show the result he wanted and unethically did invasive tests on them that he was not approved to do. He lost his medical license for that. Since that paper, since its a hot topic, there have been literally thousands of papers on the subject some with massive sample sizes and none have found a meaningful link between the two. It's always sad for a parent to find out their child might be on the spectrum, and they obviously want answers, they want to know \"why?\".

At the same time, the loss of stable families (kids in daycare while their parents work is not a stable family), the proliferation of mind sucking electronic gadgets, and the loss of the ability to discipline miscreants in school settings and the failure to do so at home has amplified natural tendencies all children have to misbehave. \nAt the same time, the government schools get more staff and money if they have a child with a diagnosis, pharma makes money drugging them, and parents of onlies have no confidence to say leave the kid alone, since they have no parenting experience.\nWhen you add the fact that it is much easier to teach a class of drug addled zombies than a class of normal boys, it isn't surprising so many children are being medicated.",
