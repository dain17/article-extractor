So it's no surprise that you don't see what I am trying to say.  I  will  dumb it down some more for you:  I said that flying in the Martian atmosphere is very challenging.  I put some numbers to some of the basic variables to quantify the level of challenge - 27 times harder just to get off the ground.  That's a lot.  Not impossible, but very difficult.\nAs for understanding the \"basic variables\" as you say, I am what they call a \"subject matter expert\" in this area.  I have had a long career as a technical lead in  flight dynamics for a major aerospace company, and served as the lead systems engineer for a (international) missile systems company.  I also specialize in low Reynold's number flight regimes, (even sub-critical).  I have designed and constructed my own custom propellers, so I understand the variables.  I have experience conducting tests at every major US test range, and in 10 different wind tunnel facilities across the US and Canada.    And what I am implying in my original post is that your experience with toy helicopters simply does not equip you to understand the nature of the challenges involved with mars flight.",

Without abiogenesis, their godless paradigm has no support. \n\nLife only comes from life. The first life on Earth was created by the eternal, living God. God did not create life on Mars so there is none there and there never has been. Yet these godless men will continue to hope against all hope and continue to waste time and money and resources looking for what exists only in their imaginations. It’s so pitiful. It’s like watching someone whose child has just been killed shake the child and pound on the child and try and bring the child back to life but the child will not live again. \n\nAbiogenesis is dead and evolution is dead but the haters of God remain in denial and won’t let go. It’s just so sad. \n\nGod is very real and he is risen from the dead and he will be returning to Earth shortly. Jesus Christ will be ready to wage war this time. Don’t be on the losing side.",
