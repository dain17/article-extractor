The raid on Trump's house was no coincidence, but appears to be part of the strategy along with the Jan 6th committee.  The special master review will alter the Democrats planned time table concerning leaks and a possible indictment of Trump before the elections whether the DOJ has a prosecutable case or not.  Any DOJ appeals will also effect the Democrats time table and further reduce the window for a Trump indictment before the elections.  So, don't be surprised if the DOJ doesn't appeal.",
