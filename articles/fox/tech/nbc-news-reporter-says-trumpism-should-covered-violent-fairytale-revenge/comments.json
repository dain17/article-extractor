I hope Conservatives have a back up plan in case they actually bar Trump from running. It's ludicrous that the Democrats are calling Republicans and MAGA supporters a threat to democracy. They are the ones pushing socialism. Ask the Venezuelans and Cubans about socialism. It's not the utopian dream theses lefties think it is.",

Too many law abiding, hard working, tax payers who have every right to their opinions too, have been treated so unjustly and who want to save democracy, not tear it down. What right does anyone, especially a President, to say such terrible things…it’s our tax dollar at work too let’s not forget. Law and order seems to now be old fashioned…really…and making excuses and taking it to the extremes blaming the other …it’s everyone’s fault etc., really getting on everyone’s nerves. It’s these kind of people who ARE THE PROBLEM. It is time moderates on both sides take action and vote responsibly…to make it possible for both sides to work responsibly, and that are truly civilized human beings. We need to also hold accountable people like this who stir up problems that provoke violence and to  be held responsible…not have them try to blame it on the other party and get away with it.

Let’s hope that Fox News can still continue to bring truth in reporting without turning into another liberal media.

I’m sure they were liberal democrats but yet seemed to bring newsworthy news into our living rooms each evening but today it’s all about slamming and slinging mud and spinning a story to help the democratic socialist party’s agenda, which means destroying our democracy as a Republic and dragging the Conservative Republicans through the mud.

I found this published by the Mises Institute.  I know it is long but please take a second to read it and provides food for thought.  Why do the hate Donald Trump\n\n \"It is acceptable practice for any politician and bureaucrat to criticize things that happen within the Washington, DC, sandbox in which these people play. But woe to the politician or bureaucrat who challenges the sandbox itself. He is toast.\n\nNo president since John Kennedy has dared to do that. Kennedy did it, especially in his famous Peace Speech at American University five months before he was assassinated. He said that the Cold War was a crock and that he was calling an end to it, which, needless to say, constituted a grave threat to the sandbox in which the national-security establishment had been playing and hoped to continue playing for the indefinite future.\n\nWe all know what happened to Kennedy, or at least those of us who are not afraid to examine and challenge the dark inner workings of the national security state sandbox. No president since Kennedy has dared to do that…until Donald Trump came along.\n\nNo matter his faults and failures and poor policy decisions, there is one indisputable fact about Donald Trump: He is not like the rest of the Republican and Democrat politicians or their followers and supporters in the mainstream press. During his campaign, he called them out all. He challenged their sandbox or, if you will, their swamp. He appeared to be willing to take on the military and its forever wars as well as the intelligence community and its nefarious, dark-side activities. He garnered lots of support and votes for that stance.\". ",

You can’t call yourself a patriot if you were for the insurrection on Jan 6!  You also can’t call yourself patriots if you are siding against the FBI.

Trump followers always call themselves patriots when they obviously don’t understand what the word means.
