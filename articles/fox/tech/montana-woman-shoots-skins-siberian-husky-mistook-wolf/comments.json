It was far away and I’d never seen a bear in the wild before so I agreed with him. He shot it. Turns out it was basically a cub. Few months away from his mother. One man could lift the bear by himself. All the other hunters laughed and laughed at the guy, making jokes about how big it was. The guy who shot it turned to me and said “you told me it was big” and tried to blame me for it. When you mess up own up to it. All this trying to blame others for your mistake just makes you look worse.",

He proceeds on to his own hunting spot. Within minutes afater he settles into his own spot he hears a gunshot coming from his wife's direction. Then he hears another. He starts getting excited thinking \"Maybe she got one!\". He begins heading back to his wife when he hears another gun shot and can now make out some yelling. As he gets closer she is still shooting and he hears her yell out \"Get away from my deer!\", another gunshot and then another \"Get Away From My Deer!\". Now the man is really worried and as he reaches his wife he sees she is shooting at a man out in a field and she is just screaming \"Get Away From My Deer!\" and then that's when the the man she was shooting at yells back, \"Lady you can keep the deer but can I just have my saddle back ?!\"",

        "context": "Yrs ago during a Deer hunt,,something was approaching. I grabbed my rifle ,hunkered down behind a log and it approached. It was a Coyote ..As it stood there panting I'd admired the animal..I had no intention of harming it...Slowly it turned and as it did,,I saw the limp and blood dripping where it's leg had been shot off.. It was bleeding to death. I shot him. As I held it I wept. It was very large and beautiful. The teeth were so white they were blue. I know some justify killing them..I don't. I never took pleasure taking a buck either..The hunt I loved,,the tactics,the tracking..but seconds after the animal went down melancholy would set in..I loved the venison and taking the animal down yourself paid homage to the animal at every meal.  You would set down and remember the day. A few yrs ago I dropped one and as I approached I watched the life fade in it's eyes. From a rich crystal brown to a dull gray. It was my last hunt. I have nothing against hunting for food ,,but to hunt for bloodlust sickens me. This woman's entire story is a lie.",

It took nearly five hours to hang, and after drying made a quarter of a ton of Jerry, all legally hunted and for personal non commercial use.\n\nAnyway, to cut a long story, I was her biggest catch, and, fifty eight years later, she still won't let go, and right now, as I type this, she still snores contentedly in my bed, next to me.\n\nOur little boys, however, are far less of a success, having turned turned out Woke intolerant Democrats, and being White Conservatives are not politically worthy to meet our grandchildren.",

Early one morning  as we were sitting around the fire eating breakfast we heard shots from the next camp down. We walked down the road and found the wife of one from that camp “Tagging” one of the mules. She claimed it was a cow elk and none of us disputed her including the owner. He explained later that this was likely it’s  last hunt anyway. By the time the husband got there it was skinned out and in the game bag. ",
