It is hard to believe that so many people in America do not see how Biden is destroying this country. Many Americans who have worked hard day in and day out for decades providing for their families and planning for retirement have to delay retirement. Some are wondering if they will ever be able to retire because of inflation, which continues to rise. Often, retirees have a fixed income. Rapidly rising inflation erodes a fixed income. Biden does not care whether people who have worked for a living and supported their families and paid taxes have enough money for basic living expenses. People need to pay for utilities, housing, food, water, clothing, healthcare, and more. Joe Biden only cares about his woke agenda and shutting down the oil and gas industries. We need a conservative Congress (with term limits) and we need a conservative president. Otherwise we will lose the country. Term limits -Voter ID!",
