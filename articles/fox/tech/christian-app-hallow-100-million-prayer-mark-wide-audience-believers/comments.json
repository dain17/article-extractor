God calls us to be immovable in our beliefs, to stand firm and always be like a rock (Acts 5:29, Ephesians 6:13). \n\nEastern meditation is pushed because it allows you to suffer more and be more tolerant of the suffering they are about to inflict on humanity.

That is why this nation has no official religion or official language. In 1800's the president of the United States made war in Utah with the Mormons, since the governor of that time in Utah wanted to make a religious state and it was not allowed, and he was removed from office, in the same way it happened with the Puritans The government did not allow them to create religious states, and thank God, otherwise we would be like the religious countries that persecute other religions and kill and imprison in the name of God.

The Bible clearly and consistently states that receiving Jesus Christ as Savior, by grace through faith, grants salvation (John 1:12; 3:16,18,36; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10,13; Ephesians 2:8-9). The Roman Catholic Church rejects this. The official position of the Roman Catholic Church is that a person must believe in Jesus Christ AND be baptized AND receive the Eucharist along with the other sacraments AND obey the decrees of the Roman Catholic Church AND perform meritorious works AND not die with any mortal sins AND etc., etc., etc. Catholic divergence from the Bible on this most crucial of issues, salvation, means that yes, Catholicism is a false religion. If a person believes what the Catholic Church officially teaches, he/she will not be saved. Any claim that works or rituals must be added to faith in order for salvation to be achieved is a claim that Jesus‚Äô death was not sufficient to fully purchase our salvation.",

First it treats biblical text with a different standard that other ancient historical works (many of which have supernatural claims in them as well).  Historians are fine with finding a work that mentions Aristotle even if they don't have another source to corroborate that claim.\n\nSecond, this puts atheists into an infinite regressive loop.  If a biblical text requires corroboration from another source, then that other source needs corroboration itself from yet another source.  And then that source must be corroborated with something else.  And so on.\n\nWhat the above argument is trying to do is discredit the text without actually being able to show how it's wrong.",

But in this animalistic humanist world few are willing to reach toward the \"religious\", the eternal, because that has great moral implications for their present daily lives, how they SHOULD live.\n\nThis app helps them to understand their spiritual nature, by helping them reach out to God's Spirit, to find their identity in God, as their Creator, and to Whom they are ultimately accountable.",
