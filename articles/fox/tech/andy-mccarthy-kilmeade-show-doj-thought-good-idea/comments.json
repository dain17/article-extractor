On the DOJ reply to not wanting the independent magistrate, one page is saying they have completed the investigation and turned the papers over to investigators, so there is no need for a magistrate, on the very next page it says the magistrate would interrupt the investigation of the documents.  So, which is it are they finished or not?  A first-year legal assistant could write a better objection.\n\nThe DOJ went in looking for documents they amazingly can't find on Cross Fire Hurricane they think Trump has copies of that are damning to Obama, Biden and Clinton.  The don't have those and they have nothing.  This is just another attempt to discredit the president and you will never see an indictment because then the affidavit becomes unredacted and the who thing falls apart.  Watch and see.",
