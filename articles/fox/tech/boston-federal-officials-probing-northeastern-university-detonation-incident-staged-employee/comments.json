When they get bored or find it too difficult to control the people, they create a  big fire.

They blame you, the victim, for the fire, claim victory for saving the day, and expect to be rewarded. And you get to be the bad guy. You know, like how they are creating chaos with race-baiting, launching new ways to discriminate, creating chaotic, setting up fake kidnappings, and high visibility  riots. Only violent situations on a grand scale that they know normal citizens cannot handle themselves. So they barge in to save the day‚Ä¶ and say for all to hear: ‚Äòoops sorry a few of you innocent citizens died or were maimed.
