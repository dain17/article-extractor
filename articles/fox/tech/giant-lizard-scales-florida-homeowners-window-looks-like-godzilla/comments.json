Although these lizards are carnivores, they have a penchant for roaches, earthworms, super worms, and other insects.  These aggressive eaters will consume nearly anything placed in front of them.  However, variety and balance are key to a healthy monitor.  Hatchlings and juveniles are primarily insectivores in the wild but in captivity can be taught to eat other foods as well such as Mazuri carnivore mixed with insectivore chow.\"\n\n-Source - Chicago Exotics Animal Hospital.",
