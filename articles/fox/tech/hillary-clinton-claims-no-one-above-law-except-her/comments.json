A three-year State Department investigation concluded in September 2019 that 38 individuals were \"culpable\" in 91 instances of sending classified information that reached Clinton's email account, though it found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\". Yet a September 2022 \"Fact Checker\" analysis by The Washington Post, which followed a tweet by Clinton claiming, \"I had zero emails that were classified\", also quotes the same 2019 State Department report as having noted, \"None of the emails at issue in this review were marked as classified.\"",

She was careless and sloppy in safeguarding classified information. She should have had her clearance revoked. Trump removed and brought home classified documents that were clearly marked with cover sheets and full markings. He was asked to return them, but only returned some. He was subpoenaed to return the rest and only returned a few more. He refused to let the DOJ investigators search the boxes where the documents were believed to be stored. His lawyer signed a statement that all subpoenaed materials were returned after a diligent search. When the search warrant was served, many more classified documents found throughout MAL. All of that shows intent to keep them hidden and illegally retain them. That would get anyone with a clearance arrested.",
