Many whistleblowers also say there’s also a bag full of Ukrainian money up there worth hundreds of dollars. As everybody already knows, aliens from Roswell are using technology that makes these items and many other items invisible. However, Adam Schiff, a hybrid, could possibly see through their cloaking device and report what only he can see to Congress again. It’s precisely this invisible evidence that Trump is especially worried about and desperately trying to distance himself from. The Democrats won’t stop looking until Adam says they’ve found the invisible evidence. Adam never stops looking for invisible evidence. This explains the neck.",
