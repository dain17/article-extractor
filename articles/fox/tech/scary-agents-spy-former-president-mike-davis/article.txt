Former Supreme Court law clerk Mike Davis revealed exactly who is the target of growing anti-FBI rhetoric Saturday on "Unfiltered."

They even spied on him when he was the president of the United States. That is pretty scary when federal law enforcement agents are so emboldened that they think that they can spy on the president of the United States. This is not an attack on rank-and-file law enforcement agents around the country. This is about the political leadership in the FBI and at main justice in Washington, D.C.
