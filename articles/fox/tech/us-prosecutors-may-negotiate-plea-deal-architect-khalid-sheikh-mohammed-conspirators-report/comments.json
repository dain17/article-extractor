They were eventually released under pressure by the GW Bush (R) administration and fled back to the Israeli regime.   Later when Paul Kurzberg was asked why they were filming the first plane hitting the WTC during an interview on Israeli TV, he replied that their \"Purpose was to Document the Event\".\nI'm not saying that they were behind the 9/11 attacks just because they knew the exact date, time and target of the 9/11 attacks, or because they were celebrating the deaths of so many Americans, but it sure is suspicious.
