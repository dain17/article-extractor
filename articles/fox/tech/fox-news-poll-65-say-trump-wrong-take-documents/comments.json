The administration’s classified documents are stored in a separate NARA facility in the Washington, D.C., area.\nPresidential libraries are managed by NARA, and the documents therein belong to the agency, which also manages related public records requests. But the Obama Presidential Library has no physical location; it’s the first to be wholly virtual. Some 95 percent of Obama administration documents were “born digital,” meaning they have no “hard-copy” version and don’t need to be digitized, per NARA.\nSeparately, construction began in 2021 on the Obama Presidential Center, a complex in Chicago managed by the privately-run Obama Foundation. But because the center will not be affiliated with NARA, the Obama Foundation will need to request to borrow any artifacts or records intended for display there from the government. The foundation did provide funding to NARA for digitizing the Obama administration’s paper documents, but NARA itself is responsible for actually handling them, according to the agency.\nTraitor trump?

I started to, but then I had to agree to, basically giving up my privacy to participate, so I exited the survey, then got a warning about my Mac being compromised! I have malware programs, so I got it straightened out. But anyone who agrees to participate in a survey agrees to having their answers used to prove a point that they do not agree with! Like, how long have you been physically abusing your spouse? No good answer! Polls are designed to support the answer the pollster wants to hear. Another example, “Do you support that abortion should be legal?” Personally, I think it should be legal, with very strict conditions, and it should be like the SCOTUS in 1973 majority rule stated, “It should be legal, safe and rare”. Libs have morphed that into abortion should be a woman’s choice at any time in the pregnancy, up until and sometimes after the child is born. But a pollster who supported abortion would report my answer as “supports abortion and a woman’s choice”. That is not what I believe, but what is reported. So, intelligent people do not participate in bogus polls, but we do vote!",

Tucked into a bill Trump signed into law in January 2018 was a provision increasing the punishment for knowingly removing classified materials with the intent to retain them at an “unauthorized location.”\nPreviously, someone found guilty of this crime could face up to one year in prison. When former CIA Director David Petraeus was charged in 2015 with mishandling classified data, he pleaded guilty under this statute to avoid a felony charge, as Politico pointed out. A similar situation unfolded a decade earlier, when former national security adviser Samuel Berger pleaded guilty to removing terrorism-related materials from the National Archives in 2005.\nNow, a person convicted of violating this law can face up to five years in prison ― making it a felony-level offense to mishandle classified documents under 18 U.S.C. 1924. \nIRONICALLY......WHEN TRUMP GOES TO PRISON......WE CAN THANK TRUMP!!!",
