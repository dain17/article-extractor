The 72 year old actually went after someone 6 Times under his age a 12 year old boy which Mark viewed as a threat to his son's safety and to protect his son he \"pushed\" Bruce away from his son to protect his child. A federal crime was not commited nor was any federal law broken. Bruce was pushed away from Mark's 12 year old son because Bruce's actions were viewed as threatining by his father Mark and the law allows defending of ones child's safety. The pushing was a defensive act out of protection of his son , it was NOT done to intimidate, obstruct, or threaten someone from a medical act or because of their beliefs or views ! Two completely different things. So no federal law was broken nor was any crime commited. So there was absolutely no reason for the fbi to get involved . Just another political stunt.",
