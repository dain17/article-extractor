Former FBI special agent Stuart Kaplan said FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to step down and that the agency needs an overhaul of its headquarters on Saturday's "Unfiltered." 

But this time, not only do we need to have the director step down; we need a complete overhaul of the FBI headquarters. I've said it before, I'll say it again, the seventh floor — they need to come behind in a bulldozer and just clean house from top to bottom and retool it. I think there is, unfortunately, some oversight that needs to come in and get people back on track.
