        "context": "The FBI had a rough start. It finally cleaned up its act, and the trust in its investigations grew after the Vietnam War. In a single presidential administration, the top leaders all changed. That led to a federal law enforcement agency ripe for political weaponization.\n\nPOTUS summoned his party's nominee to the White House, warning them of \"credible information of Russian influence\" in the process. Meanwhile, nobody notified the other candidate so they could take protective measures.\n\nAt the same time, the DOJ elected to soft pedal Hillary's mail servers containing classified information. [Do not forget that Hillary had to return a bunch of White House property that was not hers when Bill's term ended.]\n\nThe comments about reopening the Hillary investigation by the FBI Director were unprecedented. [No other director ever gave such a press briefing.] Days later, the FBI Director held another presser saying Hillary did not mean to do it.\n\nOne could argue the first presser intended to help Trump, but the second only benefited Hillary. Obama should have fired Comey after the first statement. After the second one, it is ridiculous that Trump had to do it.\n\nMonths later, when the FBI's text scandals came to light, it cast a shadow over anything the FBI said. Their actions since then have remained less than candid or transparent.\n\nThe distrust is in the upper hierarchy, not the thousands of agents who do most of the work.",

Some say that capitalism works for the rich, but the fact is that capitalism is far better for middle class. And it's the middle class that built this country. That's not at all hard to see, because it's the truth. A prosperous middle class is what makes America great. Besides, we cannot help the world if we ourselves are the ones that need help. When is the last time you saw the Russians or the Chinese reaching out to HELP the world??? They only reach out to DOMINATE the world.

It is clear that in the upper echelons of the FBI, where they all wear their Ivy League school ties and use their secret handshakes, they have used the Bureau to act as an agent of the Deep State, doing its bidding without hesitation. In this instance, the entire snake must be severed, not just the head. Starting over with a clean slate, and a wary eye to prevent such a corruption to occur again, is the only solution.
