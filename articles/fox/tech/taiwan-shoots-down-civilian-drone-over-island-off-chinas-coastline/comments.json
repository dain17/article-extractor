Thus far the LEFT has not directly done, so either but, considering that they still have 2 years to go & the fact that they have absolutely no dialogue with the other world leaders the likelihood is way more prevalent.  Just wondering where those LEFTISTS are or even if they really exist or perhaps it's just something the MEDIA has conjured up to promote FEAR .",
