Whatever you want to believe is no longer relevant. \n\nIf the liberal elite want abortion legalized under federal law, all they have to do is write it, pass it and have poopy pants sign it. It's that easy. But the truth is, they don't want to solve it. They want to win elections over the divisiveness of it.  \n\nFor every prochoice sky screamer upset about Roe V Wade, which RBG didn't even agree with, your actual beef is with Chinatown Nancy, Cheese Cake Chuckie and the Kenyan puppetmaster of the dude with the coloring books, eating Jello, wearing depends in the oval office.",
