It seems that this has been a trial run by Marxist activists to see what they can get away with.  The ultimate purpose of their efforts is to erase American history.  This is glaringly evident by their attempt to erase Christopher Columbus, the purported discoverer of America.  They apparently claim all of the past sins of America are due to his \"discovery\" of America.  The concept is ridiculous on it's face.  In addition, they have no large surveys of Native Americans or other evidence that supports their conclusion.  They do not actually care about the feelings of these people which is evident by  their attempt to remove gender from Hispanic language.  Surveys have shown only 2% of these people agree with that concept, while the vast majority HATE it.  Yet they continue to push for the term Latinex.  The pulling down of historic statues during the 2020 riots is another example of their attempt to erase U.S history.  Erasing history  is one of Marx's three main principles to gaining control of a country, the other two were removing religion and the family unit.",
