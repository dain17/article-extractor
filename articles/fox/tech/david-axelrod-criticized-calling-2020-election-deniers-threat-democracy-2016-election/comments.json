They boycotted his inauguration and tried to impeach him twice.  On national TV the Speaker of the House showed her Trump hatred to the nation.  Yet we are to believe if the Democrats loose the House and Senate our democracy will be at risk?  I think it has been.  Not by Trump but by Democrats.",

Voter turnout was highest among those ages 65 to 74 at 76.0%, while the percentage was lowest among those ages 18 to 24 at 51.4%. Overall, voter turnout increased as age increased, with the exception of 75-plus which had a turnout rate that was below 65-74 year-olds and not significantly different than the turnout for 55 to 64 year-olds.
