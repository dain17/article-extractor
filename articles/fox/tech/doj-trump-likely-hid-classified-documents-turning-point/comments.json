You want us to forget that the FBI raid was supposed to be about an informant seeing a NUCLEAR WEAPONS DOCUMENT in Donald Trump's house.  Both President Biden and Merrick Garland told news reporters there was an alleged nuclear weapons document.\n\nBut some of us know that Top Secret is not the top security classification.  There are FIVE MORE LEVELS ABOVE TOP SECRET.  Such documents are kept in thick-steel-walled vaults.  You cannot remove Above Top Secret documents from the vault.  The President has to go to the Pentagon where the vault is.  Any document that could get Trump executed for treason is in one of those vaults.\n\nNow, Kurtz, YOU are trying to make it sound like Trump hiding documents was the impetus all along.  No, it is a desperate attempt to salvage a smart-aleck strategy.  The affidavit cannot be fully revealed because doing so would likely cause monstrous EMBARASSMENT to the Biden administration that the impetus was the alleged nuclear weapons document.  How could Biden and Garland NOT KNOW that a nuclear weapons document cannot leave the Pentagon vault, therefore Trump never had one in the White House to move to his own home? \n\nFurthermore, Kurtz, you are kidding yourself if you think the Biden administration didn't know what was in those classified documents on the day they were confiscated.",

We now know that the FBI was tipped off that there was more boxes,  that boxes were kept hidden from them in June.   They got the search warrant and found hundreds of classified documents including many labeled Top Secret including in Trump's own desk drawer.  'That is obstruction of justice.",
