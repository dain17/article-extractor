Free speech is not to be controlled and \"filtered\" out because it doesn't meet the propaganda that the ruling parties are forcing down people's throats...biggest example is \"climate change\", they keep telling us this is \"settled science\", but really there is no actual science to support their positions, just rhetoric and misguided beliefs! All this twaddle is to control every aspect of the economies thus total control over us! They act like there has never been hurricanes, tornados, droughts and floods and they pretend that these 'weather' conditions are getting more often and severe...research it yourself and you will know severe weather has been around for centuries long before vehicles and factories! I like when they say in their presentations, that this is the worst flood in 500yrs (meaning it happened before...500yrs ago!).
