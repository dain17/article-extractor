Isn't there someone in this administration with enough intelligence to realize this?  She consistently looks like a deer caught in headlights.  She tries the Biden approach, of reading off notes or a teleprompter at a time.  She's clearly unaware of the issues, is unable to discuss things.  Jen was, for the most part, well-prepared.  Although, there were sometimes when she was caught off-guard, particularly during the height of the Afghanistan debacle, when the various spokespeople speaking on behalf of the administration were contradicting each other.  Occasionally, Biden went off the written script and left her in a bad situation.  But for the most part, she held her own. However, this is what happens when you are more interested in checking boxes than seeking competence.  For her sake, replace her with someone who has some level of ability. She doesn't deserve what she has been forced to endure.  What's worse, she's not even dealing with a hostile press.  Could you imagine her handling the press during the Trump administration?  She would have been carted away after having a nervous breakdown.",

Okay, you have that figure? Now, subtract Biden's number from Trump's number and then divide that by the 20 months that Biden has been in office. What's the number?\n\nThis exercise is not designed as a gotcha. We know Trump lost a massive amount of jobs ONLY because we had the covid pandemic. Remember, though, that it was mostly the lefties who locked down the country, so Trump had nothing to do with those job losses, as I would not blame Biden for them if that happened on his watch. \n\nNow you've done the calculations, how many jobs has Biden added and how many is that on a monthly basis.",
