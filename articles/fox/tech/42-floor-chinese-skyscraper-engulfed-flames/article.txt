A 42-story building in Changsha, the capital of China's southern province of Hunan, was seen engulfed in flames and black smoke on Friday. 

Videos of the incident showed debris falling to the ground and workers evacuating the building, which belongs to the country's largest telecoms operator. 

The city's fire department said 280 firefighters were deployed and were able to quickly put out the fire on the 720-foot-tall building.

Social media users complained of being unable to use their phones. However, China Telecom said in a statement that there was no disruption to cellphone service. 

Officials said no casualties or injuries were reported in the blaze, as dozens of floors burned.

There was no immediate information on the cause of the fire.
