Quite the system - the guard on duty in the shack simply slaps a wall-mounted button and the barrier (a couple of hundred yards and several sharp corners away) drops into place.  It is rated to stop a 10,000 lb. vehicle traveling at 30mph (and trust me, no vehicle can accelerate fast enough to get past that metric).  The route is bordered on both sides with 10' chain-link fence topped with razor wire and reinforced with three 1\" steel cables which would probably stop a tank.
