Helsinki 2018 was clearly the a moment all Americans should have paid attention to. trumps attempts to dismantle NATO are also now legend and in fact trump promised to pull the US out as he did with many other agreements and global associations. Putin gambled that trump would return to office and once he lost Putin moved on Ukraine. It really is that simple. We should also take note that trump has yet to denounce the war in Ukraine....in fact, he stated the opposite. In the end, trump is our number one national security threat....and I'm a real republican telling you this.....I'm not a weak of mind easily conned tribal trumplican.",

You just proved my point. Thank you! \n\nThat's like saying \"Canada was always thinking about war\", and when they invaded America, America was shocked and caught off-guard!\nIf only America had known!! LMAO!",

Later, the Polish dictator Jozef Beck refused to allow the German city of Danzig to return to Germany.  Beck put is faith in his military alliance with the mighty French Empire.\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was proposed by Stalin, the communist dictator of the USSR.  Hitler hoped that the pact would prevent a war with Britain and France, if he went to war with Poland over Danzig.   Stalin hoped that the pact would encourage Hitler to attack Poland, resulting in a war between the capitalist powers of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy.\nHitler launched his attack on Poland (joined by Slovakia) on Sept 1, 1939.  Britain and France declared war on Germany on Sept 3, 1939, thus starting WW-II in Europe.  However, Britain and France did nothing to help the dictator Beck and Poland.  Stalin saw this, and launched his own invasion of Poland on Sept 17, 1939.  Britain and France did not declare war on the USSR!\nSome interesting books:\n\"The Origins of the Second World War\", by A.J. P. Taylor\n\"Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War\", by P.J.
