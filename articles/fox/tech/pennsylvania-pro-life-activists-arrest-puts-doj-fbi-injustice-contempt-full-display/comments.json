Absolutely none of this situation or really any of these abortion situations need to fall outside the state laws that have been violated.  Abortion is a state issue.  Get used to it.  We all have to.  If the DOJ and FBI want to arrest somebody, how about going down down to Texas and arresting a few people for illegally entering the United States?  A federal offense.  They seem to be more than willing to leave that problem in the hands of the states, federal responsibility notwithstanding.   They need to fire everybody in the FBI above the rank of branch head and start over.   The FBI leadership has forgotten what business they are in, and they refuse to be reminded.  I blame the FBI because they were on the scene.  They could have communicated with local authority and deferred to that authority in spite of the agenda at the DOJ.  It is called risking your job to maintain your integrity.  We all have to from time to time, and sometimes it does not end well.  But it was their turn.",

When you have a radical like him running the show expect to be targeted if your political opinions don't line up. This is the same guy who labeled parents domestic terrorists for voicing their concerns. This case was thrown out since the accuser never showed to court multiple times, yet for some reason the DOJ picked it up. Since when did shoving a person away from your child warrant a raid from the FBI? If the accuser never showed means he knew he didn't stand a chance in court. One minister with no history of violence didn't need more than 2 agents to make an arrest. This screams make an example of what happens when you don't fall in line. Which has now sparked more public distrust for the Garland and the DOJ.",
