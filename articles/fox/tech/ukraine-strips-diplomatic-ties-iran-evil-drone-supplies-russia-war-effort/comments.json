Yes, the down side is we have given them billions of dollars in military hardware to conduct a counter offensive. Ukraine has destroyed a large portion of the outdated Russian military by mostly using small arms which is impressive. If Russia was able to capture Ukraine, they would move on to the next country, and the one after that, and so on. It would destabilize Europe and if you think our economy is bad now, just wait. A bonus is the Ukrainians are fighting a proxy war for NATO and they have destroyed a large portion of our enemies military. Win win",
