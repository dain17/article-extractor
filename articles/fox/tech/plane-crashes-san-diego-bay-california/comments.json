Plane got tossed 10,000 feet down in blink of eye. Captain came on with voice that sound like he was very calm and collected. Sorry folks hit batch of small turbulence there nothing to be scared about. Very reassuring. I was sitting right behind the pilots btw. I saw him reach for his coffee his hand was shaking so bad like he had just killed someone.  That's when I was like we must came really close to disaster. ",
