Hillary Clinton, of course, would never accept the outcome.  She still hasn't! \nThe big lie was that she really won.  Bitter that it didn't turn out that way, she and her cohorts decided to implement Plan B which was delegitimizing Trump's election victory, forcing him to resign or removing him from office.  Their tentacles in the Deep State ran deep.\nThe Russia accusation, supported by the false Dossier, grew feet and they got a lot of mileage out of it.  It took a determined Congress to coax out enough of how the whole scheme was set up to realize it was based on false documents (bought and paid for by Hillary and the DNC), false accusations and innuendo they managed to pass off as fact from sources they attacked with innuendo & hearsay litigation/prosecutions.  That's all it was.  Legal perfidy tricks that practitioners of the legal arts know how to use. \nTrump survived.  They are up to it again.  If they can get Trump out of the way, Hillary will run again.  She's baack!      ",

The remedy is limited to removal from office. Because all officers in the federal government are confirmed in the Senate, officers appointed under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution may also be disqualified from holding any other appointed office under the United States in the future.
