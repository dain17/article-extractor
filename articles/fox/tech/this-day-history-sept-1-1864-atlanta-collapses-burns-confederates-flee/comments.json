Confederate forces  retreated and abandoned Atlanta on Sept 1, 1864 and exploded what munitions they could not take with them which resulted in fires that burned a few buildings.  This was NOT the burning of Atlanta.  The burning of Atlanta took place on Sherman's orders on Nov 15, 1864, 45 days after the city surrendered to Union forces and was occupied by  Sherman.  Sherman publicly announced his intention to burn the city to the ground and the city father's begged him not to as it would leave much of the city's population (mostly women, children & elderly) homeless.  Their correspondence is preserved in writing and is heartbreaking to read.  Why would a military commander burn a city to the ground that had no opposing forces in it and had submitted to Union authority?  An act which would result in many unnecessary civilian deaths.  It remains one of the cruelest, unjustified acts of that war or any war.",

The couple were Isidor and Ida Strauss, the retailer they bought was R.H. Macy & Company but history remembers them most as the elderly couple so devoted to each other they refused to be parted in the face of disaster and were lost aboard RMS Titanic.",

If people think Atlanta had it bad they should read what Sherman and his forces did to South Carolina, the birthplace of the war.  It makes Atlanta look like a weekend barbeque.

Sherman asked for a truce in order to remove the citizens and as much of their belongings and baggage as could be carried.

So much for the \"Army of the Lord\" fighting for an end to slavery, but then, Sherman was a virulent racist.) He needed the Confederate Army of Tennessee's help (wagons, horses, etc.) conducting the citizens southward. In response, Hood agrees but adds:\n\"And now, sir, permit me to say that the unprecedented measure you propose transcends, in studied and ingenious cruelty, all acts ever before brought to my attention in the dark history of war. In the name of God and humanity I protest, believing that you will find that you are expelling from their homes and firesides the wives and children of a brave people.\" Post evacuation, Atlanta was burned.",

Does one not see that they, the Northern forces, took the homes away from an unarmed population as winter was approaching and then burned them as they left? That the Northern forces used the 1860 Census to know exactly which farms had food/crops for its soldiers, literally stealing all the food in the area, leaving people to scavenge the land to find food, again, prior to winter. How many people died from this, both black and white?\nDo you not know that all the \"freed slaves\" who trusted the Northern forces were abandoned as the army pulled out?  Read about the drownings at Ebenezer Creek.  \nSherman was called a \"drunken Butcher\" for a reason. All the whitewashing of the history, all the claims of why the South wanted out of the Union because of the slavery issue is not correct. The South succeeded because it was carrying 75% of the nation's taxation, not over slavery.  The North couldn't stand alone without the tax money collected from the South.\n\"History is written by the victors\" said Winston Chruchill, but it doesn't mean the truth was told then or today.   Suggestion: Read history books printed before 1980, read the historical archives... discover how much and why the lies are said.  \nWhat was done in the Southern states... the following years of martial laws, the denial of justice, voting rights, the stealing of property, proves vengeance, not victory of a just cause.",

William Tecumseh Sherman burned nearly all of the captured city of Atlanta, Georgia, United States.\"\n\n\"More than 3,000 buildings (including businesses, hospitals, homes, and schools) were destroyed. The Atlanta Campaign aimed to cut off Atlanta’s vital supply lines that provided Confederate troops with reinforcements, ammunition, and goods such as clothes, first-aid medicines, and equipment. As Atlanta lay smoldering, Sherman and his troops began their audacious, infamous “March to the Sea,” a massive scorched-earth campaign that ended in the port city of Savannah, Georgia, on December 21.\"\n\nI owe so much to FOX News for clearing that up for me.",
