These were by and large successes as far as my unit achieving the stated goals of the mission.  But in the long run, due mainly to the stupidity of politicians, the missions failed.  This is due to the short sightedness of the politicians.  An example of this is UNMIH, the “United Nations Mission In Haiti”.  We were given the mission, “Provide a stable environment for free and fail elections.”  So we did that, and Haiti’s national elections went off rather smoothly.  Then the politician declared victory, we left, the Haitian people ousted the elected President, reinstalled the previous dictator and we now still have Haitian boat people showing us in Florida, 35 years after we allegedly solved Haiti’s problems.",

Remember, it was campaign Obama that continually shouted we didn't have enough troops, that we abandoned Afghanistan.  What was really going on was GWB changed the Afghan war to a Special Ops war with military patrolling the border to capture those who'd come over from Pakistan.  This occurred between 2001-2006 timeframe.  Then, the Taliban started to return from 2007 on....so that when Bush left their were 32,000 troops in Afghanistan.  From 2009 on?  Obama/Biden surged our troops with boots on the ground and then surged some more.  They sent a huge State Dept. presence into Afghanistan.\n\nSo blame GWB for occupation??  Nope, blame Obama/Biden.",

That is the UN's job, not ours, and it is not our job to pick up their slack if they don't do their job.\nIf our military personnel want to feel assured that their sacrifice is worth it, make sure that you fulfill your sworn oath by your actions, and refuse orders that lead you astray from that oath. Protect American citizens. Defend the Constitution from attacks both foreign AND DOMESTIC. Because while you were all off fighting Afghanistan's war, Marxists were here infiltrating our government at the highest levels (including the military) and are *right now* perpetrating the largest attack on the Constitution that has ever occurred.
