Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett reacted to top FBI agent Timothy Thibault's resignation on "Hannity."

And now we learned just a few days ago a top FBI official is escorted from the building because those whistleblowers came forward and said this is a guy who opened an investigation of Trump in 2020, concealing his political bias and motivations, while at the same time he was shutting down the Hunter Biden investigation and spreading the lie that the laptop was Russian disinformation.Â 

So, you know, Biden has it wrong. Americans are right to be both outraged and sickened by the conduct of top officials at the FBI. I agree with you. The rank and file, these are good, honest, honorable people. But the rot begins at the top. And Merrick Garland and Director Wray have done nothing to clean up that cesspool that continues to infect the FBI.
