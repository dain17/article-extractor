It's our military built and paid for by us the American tax payer. \nWith despots and racists and turncoats like Biden and Swalwell and most of the other democrats in office...who needs global enemies?\n Biden is the worst president ever and it's not even close. Carter was bad and personally I think Obama was worse and i voted for him the first time. \nJoe takes the cake though. Telling American citizens they need fighter aircraft to take on the country...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. \nAs much as Joe and the rest of his cult of sheep and morons along with the extreme political bias of the MSM want to believe that this country is theirs and theirs alone it simply isn't true. \nAnyone on the ropes about which side they're going to vote for in November remember one thing. Your vote only doesn't count if you don't cast it. \nPersonally I hope the Republicans take back the house and Senate to make Joe a lame duck. He and his handlers have done enough damage in 2 years. Vote Red!!!",
