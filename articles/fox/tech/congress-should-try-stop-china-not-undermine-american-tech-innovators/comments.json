They have the people and they can put them where they want them, no matter what the individuals involved may wish. The US needs to start supporting their industrial base much more by reduced regulation and, if necessary, import restrictions.

Communism strangles productivity and human rights. Communism puts the means of production and all property in the hands of corrupt and incompetent party bosses. Communism empowers the privileged Communist elite, not the toiling workers. That is the history of Communism in a nutshell. The profit motive becomes the power motive. Rule by fear.
