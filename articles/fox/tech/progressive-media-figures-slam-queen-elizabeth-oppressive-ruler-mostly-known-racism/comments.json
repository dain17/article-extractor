The answer is no. Secondly, whether the monarch can unilaterally dissolve Parliament is moot since no monarch would do so, as the Parliament would either abolish the prerogative or perhaps abolish the monarchy. An no the king could not take absolute power as the monarch has no authority to enact laws. Under the British constitution the parliament is supreme. Only the Parliament can enact law. No monarch would be foolish enough to to challenge that. So your point is meaningless and has nothing to do with the issue raised in the article. By the way, Britain has no written constitution, so there is no “clause.” I also suggest you reread the Wikipedia article about the royal prerogative. It is far less certain than you think that the monarch may unilaterally dissolve Parliament. ",

Perhaps more than one-fourth of the world endorses racism and colonialism, but I suspect they find an association with Britain to be beneficial in many ways. Britain has been guilty of exploitation and racism in the past, certainly. Blaming the Queen for the sins of the past is merely part of the Marxist agenda to cancel history and replace it with propaganda. Britain left its colonies in far better condition than it found them, with political, judicial, and economic infrastructure that has survived the centuries. ",
