We need signs. Signs are good. Without signs, we'd, well,  have no signs.  And the president is one who seeks signs every day, which is what we all need to do. We must seek those signs.  Especially the top of mind signs, for they have the power.  The power to show us the signs whilst we use the tops of our minds to see these signs. I, for one, felt that Jackie was with us.  I saw the signs, I just didn't have the top of MY mind focused in on those signs.  Otherwise, Jackie may have given the president a sign, but he failed to witness it as the top of his mind had an issue with TOO MANY signs in that room.\"",
