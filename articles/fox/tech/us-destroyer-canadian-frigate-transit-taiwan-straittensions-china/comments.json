Everything the West has done is consistent with that policy, which is still the agreement to this day. China's warlike attitude toward a small island that is meaningless to them is the root of the problem. The Chinese communists are fanatics and made up of criminals, gangsters and murderers, especially at the top with Xi and his friends.
