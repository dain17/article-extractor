A worker seen what was going on went to the elections supervisor not knowing that she was the Luthor of the operation. She was promptly fired and escorted from the building for voicing her concerns.  She went to Republicans under sunshine law they demanded observers immediately Supervisor of elections refused. Court judge said now or else all ballots there gone. She still put it off 3 more days. Absentee ballots were ordered held for trial. She destroyed the ballots and made digital copies. Republicans had learned about the ink used in the forgeries was not same as the state made ballots.
