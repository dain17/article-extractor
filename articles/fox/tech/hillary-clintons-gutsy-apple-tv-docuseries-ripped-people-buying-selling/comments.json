If he DIDN'T do something and mention it, he would have been criminally liable so he HAD to talk about it.\nHillary tries to say there was no there there and she was cleared, but for some reason she still had to fabricate the Russia collusion hoax, paying MILLIONS to do so, in order to distract from her VERY REAL email server scandal that she was NEVER legitimately cleared over. He didn't shut up because he couldn't.... because YOUR EMAILS AND CRIMES WERE FOUND AND YOU ARE GUILTY. He literally SAVED you from yourself and this is how you repay him.

Maybe if you got your nose out of the Fox's rear and looked at real news stations like CNN, MSNBC, and NPR you would see that the majority of Americans are gunning for Trump and want him locked up.\nDo a quick news search for Trump today. Pretty incredible anti-American scandal.\nMrs. Clinton's series is getting great reviews and scores from everyone across the board, Fox just enjoys lying. They have to be liars right now more than ever because even though up to 3 months ago the red wave was a reality, but the reds and magas have thrown away and lost the Senate by catastrophic numbers. The House is quickly slipping away. They are losing governor seats. And because of the senate loss Gavin will for sure sweep the presidency in 2024.\nAfter his last speech, Joe's numbers are soaring according to Fox polls.\nMaga is basically an old car that's covered in flames and heading towards a cliff edge with the passengers screaming, wailing, ripping their faces off about to careen into a pit of sewer and toxic waste.\nIt was fun, but it's over for maga and the reds. Reds allowed the minority maga to pollute their ranks, and now it's all over. The reds are in an irrecoverable death spiral, and it's too bad so sad.\nIt's all over for the reds.
