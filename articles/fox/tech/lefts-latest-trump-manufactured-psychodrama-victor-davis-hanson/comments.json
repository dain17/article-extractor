Democrats however want to conflate ALL Trump and GOP supporters into this \"Ultra MAGA\" faction with the people that were trespassing in the Capitol as a threat to democracy in order to continue sowing division.\n1/6 was a demonstration that ended with a few hundred people causing a riot.  It was NEVER a threat to democracy, it was a large group of people expressing anger with the recent actions of their own government that ended up getting out of hand.  Similar to MANY of the BLM riots of the previous summer.\nAll of the following happened long before 1/6 to stoke that anger\nRussian collusion delusion created division.\nImpeachment by simple majority created division \nFBI and CIA spying on political opponents created division \nKavanaugh and ACB confirmation hearings created division\nCovid lockdowns created division\nSchool closings created division\nGeorge Floyd riots created division\nDemocrats excusing BLM and Antifa violence created division\nCircumventing state constitutions to change voting laws  created division  \nSuppressing the Hunter Biden laptop evidence and investigation created division",

Anything to redirect the narrative. But mother nature wasn't cooperating with a convenient disaster, and Biden had already proved that he couldn't manage any kind of military action. So... what to do? Then, some genius in the DNC came up with the only strategy that might possibly work at that point: revive and reinvigorate Trump. Pull off some questionable (but spectacular) action like the Mar a Lago raid and let Trump and his base take it from there. It was absolutely certain that he'd start waving the flag, renew his assertions that the election was stolen and position everything as further \"proof\" of the deep state conspiracy. It was a masterpiece of misdirection. And it was working. But (and it's a big BUT) the DNC miscalculated and pulled the trigger too early. The hoopla is dying down now because legal maneuvering just doesn't have the same appeal as a  raid by the FBI. And after the initial outrage, most people have gotten back  on track. There's plenty of time until the midterms, and continuing to prep for '24 is the second most important item on the agenda.  This was a perfect example of Democratic performance: have an idea  but totally screw up the execution. Way to go Dims!\nDeSantis '24",
