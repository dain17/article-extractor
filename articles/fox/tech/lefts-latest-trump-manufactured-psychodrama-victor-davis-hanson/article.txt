Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson described the Left's "psychodramas" used to divert from issues that matter most to the American people on Tuesday's "The Ingraham Angle."

We saw January 6 die in, die off and then it was resurrected with a raid, and then it died off, and then we had the documents on the ground and the surreal photos. And then we went into semi-fascism and then we went into that "Phantom of the Opera" set. And half the country is a threat to democracy. And now we're back with another psychodrama. And we're not talking about 3 million people flowing across the border or [how it's] unsafe to walk in American streets or stagflation and inflation at the same time. All the issues that we care about, we're only going to talk about Donald Trump and the latest manufactured psychodrama. And you can see it's Georgia 2020 all over again. Try to get two people that otherwise would not be elected by diverting the people from the issues.Â
