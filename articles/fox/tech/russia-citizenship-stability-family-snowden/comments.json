His whole story is an exaggerated tale of fluff and BS.  \nThough I‚Äôm not a fan of the USG obviously spying on its citizens, I‚Äôm also not a fan of Snowden because of his obviously narcissistic personality, and the obvious lies he has told about his story. \nSnowden was a failure that didn‚Äôt live up to his families accomplishments. He failed to get a high school degree while others in his family had high level jobs in the DOJ, military, and practicing law.  He failed basic training, something only very recruits aren‚Äôt able to pass.  \nIn addition, he wasn‚Äôt a CIA employee like he claims he was.  To be an actual employee of the CIA you need a college degree, something Snowden does not possess.  However, the CIA does have contractors, which Snowden was.  These contractors don‚Äôt have access to much.  Snowden makes it seem like everyone bowed down to him‚Ä¶ it was actually a bit the opposite.  Snowdens job was to fix computers if someone was having an issue.  For example, if someone‚Äôs mouse wasn‚Äôt working, they would call Snowden‚Äôs office (tech support) to fix it.  Snowden would tell that employee it would take a while to fix, and suggest the employee leave his or her work space, while remaining logged in to their computer so Snowden could have full access. At that point Snowden would copy all the files he could on a thumb drive.  He was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù that he found that information that he did so he use it to sell out.  Obviously, he found the highest bidder (Russia).",
