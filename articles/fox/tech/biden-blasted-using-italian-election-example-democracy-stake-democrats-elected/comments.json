But now only pity and fear for what he is doing and has done to our country.   There must be a Republican Red wave that sweeps our nation in a few weeks or we are doomed.  The United States cannot stay united under his leadership for two more years.",

The people of the US do not have any say in the rule of the country. Biden and his appointees make the rules and laws. Whether it is healthcare, immigration, the kind of car you drive , what you use to heat your home with, etc  it is not what the people want it is what Biden and his appointees mandate. That is not Democracy. Poor senile Biden is confusing democracy with autocracy but then he talks to dead people and gets lost leaving the podium when he is allowed to speak.

When you try to force a country to go \"green\" and in the process destroy it's economy, what's the up side?  Windmills and solar panels have their place but we need fossil fuels also.  Artificially limiting those supplies has put us where we are today.  It's a misguided policy, especially when our enemies have no intention of following our lead.  We need to reverse Democrat energy policy, it's just plain bad for America.",
