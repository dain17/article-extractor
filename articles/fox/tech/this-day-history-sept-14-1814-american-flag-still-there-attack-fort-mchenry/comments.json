In defiance the Americans were determined the flag wouldn't be lowered.  During the engagement, the frustrated British commander ordered all guns to target the flag to take it down by force, and they succeeded.  The response by the American forces is what I wish to note.\n\nIt is said that men ran to re-secure the flag only to get blown to bits.  Each time the flag faltered men rushed to support it.  Each group knew their fate if they did.  By morning's light the flag still flew.  At its base a very high price.  It stood not on its own but rather because it was planted and held firm by a pile of corpses.  It stood because defiant men gave their lives to assure the British never saw the flag lowered.",
