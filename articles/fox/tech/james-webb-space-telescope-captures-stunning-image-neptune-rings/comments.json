Your argument is specious, at best, ridiculous, at worst.\n\nI believe in a multiverse that may or may not be \"eternal.\" However, if it is, indeed, the \"eternity\" of which you write, it doesn't negate all other knowledge. If it did, there would be a problem: with the exception of adherents of predestination, knowledge of our past sins and indiscretions, as well as of our good deeds and contributions to the betterment of mankind, allegedly forms the basis of the eternal fate of our souls.\n\nSo, while we're talking about knowledge in general, let's get more specific and bring God into the discussion. Speaking from a Catholic point of view‚Äîmy native faith, and the only one of which I have any real knowledge‚Äîby definition, a sin is a deliberate offense against one or more of God's laws. He gave us free will, so we choose when‚Äîif ever‚Äîto sin, we choose when‚Äîif ever‚Äîto do good, and we must have knowledge of our sins in order to be judged for them. For each of us, that knowledge, while \"temporal\" in origin, must be eternal in God's mind and ours. After all, would a just God punish us without letting us know why? If you agree that all knowledge ultimately comes from God, you must admit temporal and eternal knowledge become the same when one dies. In other words, temporal knowledge and eternal knowledge are essentially identical, and are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, 'nuff said. I've made my point.",
