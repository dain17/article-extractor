Not to get overly technical, but AFV autoloaders usually carry their ammo in the turret basket, which poses the risk of explosion if the armor is penetrated. (See photos of disabled Russian tanks in Ukraine)  The time advantage from autoloading in a modern tank is quite small.  That's why most western tanks don't use that tech, and rely more on precision than rate of fire.\n\nThere's much less concern with a \"robotic\" AFV - no crew, more compact, more available weight for armor.",
