I now have heart issues, I have been sick more times since the shot then I have ever been in my whole entire life. I have lost family members who never had any kind of health issue and drop dead three days after getting the shot. Friends who are experiencing similar attributes. Something has to be done about this and soon. China or the Biden admin one of them will have to pay for the crimes against Americans.",
