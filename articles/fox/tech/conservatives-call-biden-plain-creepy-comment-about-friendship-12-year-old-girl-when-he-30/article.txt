Conservatives on social media were disturbed and confused following President Biden's cryptic remark about a friendship he had with a 12-year-old girl when he was 30.

During a speech to the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, and other Democrats on Friday, Biden momentarily interrupted his remarks on climate change to address a woman in the crowd he apparently knew long ago.

Biden said, "And everybody found out, there’s not a lot of total climate deniers anymore after they’ve seen what happened this year. But guess what, we got a lot to do." He then pointed into the crowd, and in a low voice said, "You gotta say hi to me."

The crowd laughed and Biden said, "We go back a long way. She was 12 and I was 30, but anyway. This woman helped me get an awful lot done. Anyway."

The crowd laughed again, though not everyone who heard Biden’s off-the-cuff remark found it so endearing. 

Conservatives on Twitter found it disturbing. 

"As dementia progresses, patients lose more of their filter and tend to blurt out the truth. Biden: ‘She was 12, I was 30.’" wrote conservative podcast host Monica Crowley.

NewsBusters executive producer Tim Graham remarked, "Why Biden frustrates handlers. (‘You know the right-wingers are going to tweet 'did he sniff her hair then?’)"

"Oh my gosh," tweeted Steve Guest, Special Adviser for Communications for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. 

New York Post writer Miranda Devine asked, "Is there any exculpatory context to this?"

Conservative actor Nick Searcy slammed Biden’s supporters following the remark, tweeting, "Democrats think this is normal. @JoeBiden."

"This is just plain creepy," wrote conservative commentator Kyle Becker. 

Conservative YouTubers The Hodge Twins wrote, "Biden’s handlers are cringing after this one. #creepyjoe."
