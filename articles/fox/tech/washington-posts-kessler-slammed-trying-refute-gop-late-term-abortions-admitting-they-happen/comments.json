This limits the procreation of future generations of \"Undesirables,\" who become \"net takers\" rather than net contributors.\n\nSo, with reversal of \"Roe\" and \"Casey,\" abortion will still be legal in some states.  This makes it even more imperative to give financial incentives not only to abort, but also give those same financial incentives to BOTH women AND men to exercise CONTROL over their bodies.\n\nTherefore, in states which allow abortion, women within those states NEED FREE ABORTIONS.  For women outside those states who want abortions, provide transportation subsidies.  Also, as part of the abortion procedure, pay those same women a FINANCIAL BONUS TO VOLUNTARILY undergo sterilization.  That way, the burden of future generations of \"social parasites\" can be LIMITED, if not totally eliminated.\n\nThe same financial incentives can be offered to men to CHOOSE to exercise their right and undergo permanent vasectomies.\n\nCombined, future generations of undesirables will eventually dwindle down to a manageable number.\n\n\"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for their crimes or let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.\" (Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 208 (1927), majority opinion written by Associate Justice of the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.)",

And a lot of horrendous people have no problem with this.\n\nYou also have to wonder about lawmakers that would make a distinction that it isn't murder simply because the fully formed child wasn't given an opportunity to breathe on it's own.\n\nCan this argument be used to justify any murder?  If someone walks up behind another person and covers their mouth and nose, and murders them while doing so, can they then argue, \"The person DEFINITELY wasn't breathing when I stabbed them, so it's not murder, it's just mutilating a corpse.\"",
