Basic addition methods have been replaced by ridiculous processes that take better drawing skills and half a page of paper for each simple one or two-digit problem.  \n\nWriting isn't taught.  Not the physical skill, not proper letter shaping.  Nothing is repeated enough to develop speed or dexterity, so writing is torture (school excuse:  \"Nobody's gonna write in the future; it's all computers!\")  No structure is taught:  spelling \"rules\" are boring and somehow \"insulting\" to certain \"groups,\" and forget ideas about paragraph or essay structure.  Essays are requested starting in FIRST GRADE, because it's \"cute\" and who needs to learn form or build up knowledge of communication methodology?  Oh, and \"typing\" is only taught for a few weeks or months in Kindergarten as a matter of nearly useless online games, where kids hunt-and-peck for letters to save puppies crossing rivers, etc.  So they can't type either",

Kids who raise their hands willingly are declared \"rude\" (seriously) and their parents hear complaints of \"showing off.\"  Kids who don't raise their hands soon learn that being active in class is loudly punished with insults, so they stay quiet; better to part of the pack getting the teacher's general expression of despair and disdain, than to be singled out for personal abuse).\n\nParents are assured that the \"scattershot\" approach to every subject is fine, that \"it will all come together\" in sixth grade, where everything will miraculously \"synthesize\" and suddenly our kids will \"know\" all the math, science, English lit, writing, etc.\n\nBut when 6th grade comes, the teachers are upset, and keep repeating that they do not have time to teach what should have been learned before, so they simply won't do it.  They pass them along, too often for social reasons, or by \"elevating\" lousy work.\n\nThe students don't know, or can't fix it.  Being \"still\" and \"conforming\" is all they get rewarded for.",

How else do you explain their understandings and opinions? An Education Degree is a degree in Pedagogy,  not Math or Science. Not even History or English. The Education Colleges are the academic slums of every University in America. It shows in their speaking, teaching, and work. Why else do you think our public  schools are failing?",
