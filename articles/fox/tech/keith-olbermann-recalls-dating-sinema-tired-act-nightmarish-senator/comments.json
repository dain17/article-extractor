Could he have stated his piece without violating his vow of protecting privacy? Yep. Pretty easily too, because what he had to say could have been said without it. That being said... what is the REAL reason he decided to make it personal and open up the private vault?\n\nI am forced to reveal that Sinema and I have had a close personal relationship because she is now betraying my political beliefs, even though this relationship has no bearing on my political beliefs.\n\nIt doesn't make sense. It is more of a personal attack on Sinema so people will start asking about Olbermann and what their relationship really was. It achieves nothing more than that in reality. So WHY? Does he just want everybody to know he dipped his dinky in Sinema and he is sorry now because she's not a real democrat by his standards? Is he trying to say, \"I dated her, so I really know her and she's fake?\" That is equally unbelievable because people who are \"exes\" are jaded and wrong a lot.",
