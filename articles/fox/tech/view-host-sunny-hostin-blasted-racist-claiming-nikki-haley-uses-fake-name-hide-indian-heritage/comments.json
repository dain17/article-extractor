Her hypocrisy is deafening, yet she can't see it and instead uses it as another opportunity to criticize the country which has afforded her great wealth, fame and recognition.  And then to have Whoopi Goldberg, a woman who chose her pseudonym expressly because she believed some whacky conspiracy theory about people of Jewish heritage having a monopoly over the entertainment industry, shut the conversation down before he choice of names was even brought up.\n\nThe View is a train wreck, it's time to cancel it before it just becomes a laughing stock of television history.  If they don't it may foster a new \"jumping the shark\" industry term, I'm thinking \"flushing a View\".",
