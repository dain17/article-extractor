We've seen this already, represented by the likes of Lois Lerner, the Mueller probe, the Michael Sussmann \"acquittal\", the upcharges of the 1/6 defendants, the indictments of former Trump officials and lawyers, and now the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.

Republicans have not weaponized the government against progressives, despite all the breathless fear-mongering whenever a Republican is in the White House. As a conservative, I will take no pleasure if the Republicans begin \"paying back\" Democrats for their decades of vile behavior.\nThe solution would be for the left to dial back its propaganda machines and remove awful, lying mouthpieces like Joy Reid, Scarborough/Brzezinski, Lemon, and others, as well as gutting the boards of the NYT/WaPo for starters and restore the journalistic integrity in such short supply.",

The incremental nature of the erosion of our freedoms has accelerated exponentially in the last 6 years, likely as a result of their recognition of the possibility of another populist revolution like we saw in 2016 with Trump's election and their need to ensure that such a revolution cannot recur. This helps to explain Biden's off-the-rail behavior in his unprecedented attacks on any opposition lately. It's going to get a lot worse soon.",

I also mentioned that Sweden seemed to have made out no worse than other European nations even though Sweden did not have any lockdowns.\nThose two opinions were sufficient to get me PERMANENTLY BANNED FROM THE \"CIVIS\" NEWSGROUP OF ARSTECHNICA.\nSo be it.\nI also posted a pro Ivermectin comment on Twitter and the next day changed my password.  To this day I cannot get back. into Twitter.  Neither the old nor the new password works and I can't succeed in the \"forgot my password\" because it won't accept my u. er name or email.   The account remains there de facto suspended.\nThat is what we must gain the upper hand about and it can only be done through legislation from CONGRESS.\nIf allowed to continue, it's BAD NEWS for every citizen.",

We have a true dictatorial leader in OBiden, who wants to control and force his left socialist agenda on everyone (Climate control anyone!)  and a very forceful suppression of anyone who disagrees with their philosophy (facebook and twitter ringing any bells!. With the truth finally coming out as to just how and who told FB to target conservatives it should scare anyone who stand for our constitution and just how far we have fallen in the last 20 months!
