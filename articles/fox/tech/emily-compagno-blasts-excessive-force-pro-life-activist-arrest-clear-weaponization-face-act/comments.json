This de facto secret police must be broken up into its component parts (crime lab, HRT, etc.) which would be used to supplement the state police of the individual states, under STATE jurisdiction rather than the central federal government.  From its inception, the FBI has been a political tool serving political interests rather than the Constitution!  Federal control over that much power by one political party is too tempting for corrupt politicians and needs to be distributed to the states.",
