The MH-53 was actually 3ft or so longer than their original CH-53. The MV-22 is the AF replacement for the now retired MH-53. Longer legs and faster overall transit time. ",

Heavy operational tempo, everyone is tired, the airframes are stressed, a certain amount of breakage is inevitable.  With helos being hugely maintenance intensive...and Chinooks have not just one rotor, but two.\n\nIn this instance, it sounds like its was just a bad part (O-ring) that made it into the system, and failed in use.  So out of an abundance of caution, they ground them all, till they dig through the maintenance records and find out which airframes had that part installed during depot level maintenance.  Or tear them all down and replace that part.  It's far cheaper and easier than losing aircrew and a $30M+ aircraft because a $1.99 part failed.",

There is no such thing as a gliding helicopter.\"\n \n \"This is why being a helicopter pilot is so different from being an airplane pilot, and why in generality, airplane pilots are open, clear-eyed, buoyant extroverts, and helicopter pilots are brooding introspective anticipators of trouble.
