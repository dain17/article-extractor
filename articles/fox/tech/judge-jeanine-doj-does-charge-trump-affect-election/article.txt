Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro reacted to the Department of Justice's motion to block former President Donald Trump's request for a special master on "Jesse Watters Primetime," deeming it "another witch hunt."

The simple act of raiding the former president's home casts a major shadow over the Republican Party less than three months before the midterms. Instead of focusing on Joe Biden's crime-infested cities, empty grocery shelves, high gas prices and inflation, everyone is talking about Trump. The border, inflation, high gas, who cares? Trump's got a love letter from Rocket Man at Mar-a-Lago. I remember the days when Democrats cried foul when Comey opened up an investigation right before an election. 

… 

But now that the shoe is on Donald Trump's foot, I don't hear any of those phonies complaining now.
