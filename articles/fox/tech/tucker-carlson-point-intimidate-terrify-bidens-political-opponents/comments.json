Then all Federal agencies should be disarmed unless ORIGINALLY created as a law enforcement arm. I’d breakup the Homeland Security bunch, along with the cozy little club the 17 bed buddies Intelligence Agencies have going on, by eliminating most of them, and those I kept, would be incorporated as departments within one or two agencies with massive deep 50/50 two party oversight. Violations would start at 20-year sentences. Mandatory random lie detector tests for all. NO Intelligence information should be given in any way or form, to any and ALL retirees. (See prison above for those who give and those who receive intelligence info) Eliminate the Patriot Act, since it’s used 85+% of the time on American Citizens than the foreign enemies of our nation. Parents have the final word on how and what curriculum our children are taught. Period. No if, and, or buts, about it. Break up teaching unions. Teachers should get promotions and pay raises based on their ability to educate students, not indoctrinate them. That goes for colleges and universities too! Teachers and professors should have to pass a rotating review of students parents before they can apply for a pay raise. I believe that’s fair since the parents usually are the ones paying the extremely exorbitant tuitions. It should be considerably easy to fire a teacher / professor and have their license pulled, the same with a crooked cop or government worker or official, or a bad doctor or nurse. (This list should be kept open so we can add to it.) Civilian Companies and Businesses should have to adhere to the terms of the US Constitution, with fines being extremely high and often multiplied. But at the same time companies and businesses should have the right to impose certain regulation as terms of employment while said employee is at the time being paid or on the business property.\nJust a suggestion…",

Trump himself also starred in promotional videos and appeared in-person at events for the company.\n\nHe told recruits that the “tremendous” phones, which required ACN internet service to work, were doing “half-a-billion dollars’ worth of sales a year,” and that ACN was “at the forefront of innovation,” according to the complaint. The plaintiffs argue those claims were “abjectly false.”\n\nThe case is McKoy v. Trump Corp., 18-CV-9936, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).",
