She refused to salute the American flag during Veterans Day Service. During the 9/11 memorial ceremony at Ground Zero, after the reverent flag folding ceremony, she disgustingly said, \"All that for a damned flag?\" At Tuskegee University, instead of celebrating the graduates, she whined of the emotional toll of being the first black first lady! She actually gave a teary tale of just how bad her life is and how unfair the media is to her. What an embarrassment to America!\n  Now, we have elder abuser. Jill, who feeds Joe a pill before he tries to read his speech, oversees the Biden Crime Family, and calls Hispanics, \"Breakfast Tacos\".\n  Thank God for Melania, who gratefully displayed great love for America and respect for the flag. She speaks six languages and always looked lovely and engaged charmingly with world leaders. Brigitte Macron and Melania still communicate weekly. Her track record of good will around the world promoting children's health initiatives tells you of her amazing compassion. America was blessed to be represented by this fantastic First Lady!",
