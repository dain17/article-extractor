We have young men and women who volunteer to serve this country and put their lives on the line but can't afford to feed their families.  Many of these Soldiers, Airmen, Marines and Seabees do not qualify for SNAP because they receive BAH and BAS.  BAS is barely enough to feed a military member much less a family.  BAH covers rent but not water or electricity.  Many times servicemembers come out of pocket just to afford a decent home.  They also work for the money they do receive but we have many sitting on their butts too lazy to work that qualify for every free program the government offers. #retiredarmy",

Far too many junior enlisted see the military as an answer to their personal financial dilemma. They're under the age of 26 and have a wife and at least one kid. \nI call that irresponsible. \nAs a veteran myself, it was not a mystery to most of us that, at this point in our lives, we couldn't afford to be family men. We didn't need a financial planner to see this. The old adage was, \" If the military wanted you to have a spouse, they'd have issued one \". Sounds foolish but it had merit, and was stating the obvious. \nEntering the military is NOT the answer to your financial woes, and in fact will complicate your life. Choices have consequences, the participation awards don't pay the rent. \nDr. Jordan Peterson has a piece on delayed gratification, I recommend it to all.",
