Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, made the case that the FBI is too harsh in its investigation of some conservatives being labeled as extremists on "The Ingraham Angle."

But they investigated him a second time. It says, "No, no, nothing, nothing here." But this is what's happening at the FBI: They're being pressured to label and categorize every single case. We've had now over 14 whistleblowers come to us label every single case a domestic violent extremism case when they're not.
