The Texas would not want to test cases with either.\n\nIt is great that the US managed to conserve so many of these battlewagons, although we should have also kept a couple of the Pearl Harbor fleet- like the Pennsylvania for instance or even a slightly older design.\n\nThe British went the opposite route and converted such legends as the Bismarck smashing Rodney- which mission killed that legendary ship in 15 minutes by popping the A & B turrets like grape- into spoons and canned goods. \n\nThat not one of the venerable Queen Elizabeths (Warspite would be a great choice),  KGVs, Iron Dukes or battlecruisers was saved is criminal.
