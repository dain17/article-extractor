We watched as the vote count took over a week in several swing states, even though the vote counting machines can process hundreds of thousands of votes per hour. We watched as a county in North Carolina with fewer than 5000 voters took over a week to count their ballots. Why? Because the Dems were holding them in reserve just in case Georgia went to Donald Trump. Then immediately after Georgia was declared for Biden, the log jam in North Carolina was cleared and the little county suddenly was able to count their votes. We watched as Donald Trump won millions of votes more in 2020 than he did in 2016 and supposedly still lost. We watched as the media declared that Joe Biden won more votes than any presidential candidate in history and the voter participation rate was over 90%, after decades in which voter participation barely topped 50%. It is not believable and the fact that The Establishment wants to force everyone to accept the results, just adds more suspicion.\"",

The administration‚Äôs classified documents are stored in a separate NARA facility in the Washington, D.C., area.\nPresidential libraries are managed by NARA, and the documents therein belong to the agency, which also manages related public records requests.

But because the center will not be affiliated with NARA, the Obama Foundation will need to request to borrow any artifacts or records intended for display there from the government. The foundation did provide funding to NARA for digitizing the Obama administration‚Äôs paper documents, but NARA itself is responsible for actually handling them, according to the agency.\nTraitor trump?

He took nearly half of the country with him in his big lie. 62 court cases says he lost and has no evidence of fraud whatsoever.\n\nTrump will run the Republican party to the ground. The Democrats are in free fall and yet, if Trump runs for president he will lose, more than half of the population can't stand him. He only supports people willing to lie for him and follow him blindly. And he's staging wars inside the Republican party. It's really time to move on.",
