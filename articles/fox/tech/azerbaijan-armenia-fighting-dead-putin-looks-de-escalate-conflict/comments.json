There are four other members; all former members of the USSR. Azerbaijan was a member but left in 1999. Iran has been talking about membership for 15 years.\nThe peace has held only because Russia backed Armenia. Now that Russia is weakened, Azerbaijan will probably seek to get back the territory occupied by Armenia but internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan",
