Inside the conservative echo chamber, the Republican party‚Äôs attacks on the integrity of our elections will sow doubt and distrust in our political process. But in the real world, the idea that marquee elections are being stolen via voter fraud has now been disproven beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWhich means that, barring real evidence to the contrary, it‚Äôs time for our institutions to stop taking partisan claims of voter fraud seriously. Reporters should treat allegations of a fraudulent election the way they treat birtherism or QAnon ‚Äì as pure conspiracy theory. Courts should stop giving self-proclaimed fraud-fighters the benefit of the doubt, and instead demand that they substantiate their allegations before barring eligible Americans from the ballot box. The handful of Republican politicians who, to their lasting credit, condemned Trump‚Äôs attempts to manipulate the most recent election should be equally forceful about attempts to manipulate future ones.",
