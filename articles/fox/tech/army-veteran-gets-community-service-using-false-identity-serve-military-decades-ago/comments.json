He serves in the Army and isn't offered re-enlistment (no indication that he did something wrong, just apparently wasn't considered Army material). He re-enlists using the phony name.  During his service, it seems that he at least served adequately, he served in Berlin for several years and eventually ended up working for security firms for over 30 years.  Not condoning his actions, and I'm sure it's going to cause a little bit of a nightmare for the real person.  It's hard to view this as a \"scheme\" to get VA benefits, as he actually did serve in the Army, albeit not under his real name.  As far as community service is concerned, didn't he serve his community by serving in the Army? Perhaps the Army will take into consideration the fact that he did actually serve. Everyone failed on this--why didn't the Army catch this when he re-enlisted? He was able to renew his passport 3 times?  And, it's obvious, if the real person hadn't tried to file for health benefits, this would not have come to light.  Under the circumstances, the \"punishment\" seems just.  Ironic, when people are trying to avoid military service, he's someone who lied to get in. ",

After the end of the Cold war, however, I saw just as many decent Marines given the axe simply because of troop draw downs and budget reductions. Depending on MOS and rank, of course. By the mid 90s, the pentagon ordered a HUGE reduction in force, and the hardest hit were mid level NCO's waiting for a B billet to open up. I personally had more than a few outstanding Marines under me I had to let go because the cutting score for promotion was sky high, and The Corps mandated an \"up or out\" policy. All Promotions to Corporal were frozen in their MOS's, but you had to make Corporal to re enlist. It was a catch 22 we in the Corps called being a \"terminal Lance\".

Receiving an OTH would be easily bypassed (back then...) by identity theft.\nHe then re-enlisted under a different persona and apparently, served honorably since he qualified for VA benefits. The follow-on employment also indicates good history and performance.\nSo the big question is why the first discharge under his real name??\nVery odd. Very odd indeed...\nRegardless, thank you for your service, even if under a pseudonym. Good luck to the guy whose ID you stole.

(When I joined in the mid-1990s, we used SSN for everything...Not anymore though...) Also,  computers were not prevalent at that time so databases and cross-referencing ID markers was not common. If this guess is correct, he could have used his same SSN and received a new DoD ID number under the assumed name, creating a whole new record. If that's the case then the charges would be correct - he used a false name. And some poor guy in St. Louis happened to have that name, too.\nIf this theory is correct, he didn't actually steal the complete identity of the man whose name he used, just the name. This would be much different.\nRegardless, it sounds like he served honorably TWICE, for two different periods, under two different names, and just didn't get caught for years.\nLike I said - weird situation...........",
