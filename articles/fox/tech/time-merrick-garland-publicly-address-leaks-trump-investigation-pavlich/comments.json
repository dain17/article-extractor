It just sounds way too convenient and unlikely to have been anyone with actual first hand knowledge. \nThe fact the warrant was aporoved by a demonstrably biased low level magistrate makes me even more suspicious. \nAnd of course the timing...one day BEFORE the 90 day limit on politically charged investigations being announced before an election is extremely telling as well.

She is now also in a position of conflict of interest with her client now because of this, so will likely be forced to resign. Not good news for Trump. There are now currently 20 lawyers, including Jeffery Clark, that are under investigation or have been disbarred, mostly due to pushing the stolen election thing with false information as officers of the court. Another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, formerly an OAN media personality, publically mocked the idea Trump had nuclear secrets, a day before it was released that he did. While a lawyer's job is to represent their client they can't lie to the court like say Sydney Powell did when she presented a foreign intelligence expert witness to the court who turned out to be a convicted fraudster with no intelligence knowledge or expertise.",

Complete socialism and Marxism seems to be the goal of many Leftists, these ideologies are country killers, why many brave soldiers are buried in the ground fighting against this and tyranny, trying to keep it out of America. Now, since I'm for Democracy, does a majority of this Country WANT the Leftist ideology and their agendas, I'm not convinced that more people want \"the Leftist way\".\nI'm not worried in the slightest about \"Classified, Declassified\" docs yet. What were the docs actually? Still relevant to national security? What has Trump done with them, but store them. Why does he have them? These are questions I have, but until the facts come out I'm not listening to innuendos, speculations that leak from the media. Sadly, the DOJ/FBI has Dem Trump haters , these are the same people involved in the Russia BS, can't trust these people or the biased media, or with everything I've seen and heard the last 6 years, anyone in the Dem Govt. I'll wait for the truth, no matter what it is. You just keep hoping that after 20?25? attempts to \"get Trump\", this is the one, all many of you care about, hoping \"your\" people aren't lying to you, keep being willfully ignorant.
