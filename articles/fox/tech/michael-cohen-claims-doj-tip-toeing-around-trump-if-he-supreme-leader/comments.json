Robnett, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (‚ÄúIRS-CI‚Äù), announced today the guilty plea of MICHAEL COHEN to charges of tax evasion, making false statements to a federally-insured bank, and campaign finance violations.  The plea was entered followed the filing of an eight-count criminal information, which alleged that COHEN concealed more than $4 million in personal income from the IRS, made false statements to a federally-insured financial institution in connection with a $500,000 home equity loan, and, in 2016, caused $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election.  COHEN pled guilty today before U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III.\nformer Lawyer\nA very Dirty former Lawyer.\nJust go away Michael.",

Talk about shady.  I lived in Denver for 66 years.  Shady area to house a server, for sure!\n\nPresident Trump was elected by The majority of America, won the electoral vote, yet was deprived of his 4 years to serve as President in peace.  Clinton's, and Bidens have proof positive evidence of using their power, and positions to steal from the American People.  As well, the DOJ, FBI, Judicial system, and Liberal Media, as well as News Anchor are lying to the American People in order to assist those in power acquire riches, and power while trying to take down honest, hardworking politicians that actually did/and are doing things to help Americans.\n\nBiden is a huge JOKE!  I will take the economy with low fuel, and food prices, housing was booming, people were working, taking vacations, schools were open, we were respected around the world, and President Trump stood up, and took care of our Veterans, and Military, and our Southern Border was CLOSED.\n\nBiden is trying to take our freedom away.  IRS going after middle-class, EV's that will control how fast Americans can move, or travel, electronic everything in our homes to monitor what we are doing.\n\nWake up America!  Biden/Harris are a JOKE!  Their motive IS to suppress Americans and give \"Illegals\" roaming rights with no covid mandates, no vaccine mandate, welfare, healthcare, free cell phones plus free plans, free food and housing, free education, and some are even allowed to draw social security if they have a child born in US as a \"dreamer\".  These elder immigrants have never paid one penny into Social Security, but can still draw retirement on The American Tax Payers Backs!\n\nAMERICA....PLEASE WAKE UP!  Freedoms will be gone if we do not STEP UP and elect Representatives, and Senators that go to DC to work for The People.  Most go to fill their financial portfolio, and to attain power.\n\nIt is time Americans vote to give Congress their raises, vacation days, and Congress should be required to be in their district more than in DC working at raising money for themselves!\n\nThis American has had it with Biden!  Please, someone tell me what Harris has done at the border she was tapped to take care of.  She has done NOTHING!  What is she doing to earn her paycheck?  Nothing!!!!\n\nNovember cannot come soon enough!  Time to take our Freedoms Back!!!!!",
