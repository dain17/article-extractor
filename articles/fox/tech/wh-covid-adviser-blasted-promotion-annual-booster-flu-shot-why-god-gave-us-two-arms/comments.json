We've lived with colds for all our lives, and we've never had to quarantine or mask up as a result.\n\nThe Covid-19 Coronavirus will continue to degrade in strength as it mutates over time -- a result of natural selection. Eventually, it will plateau -- just like the common cold -- and we'll live with it -- just like the common cold.",

By not giving one means people still have immunity.\nWhere is the data showing patients re-infected, who never took shot compared to those taking the shots?   Colorado State University showed the masks do not work indoors because the virus concentration will slip by a non-sealed mask.  The masks work outdoors and 6 feet apart or in an OR where the air handler is circulating the air rapidly and removing viruses.\nYou may need to do your own research instead taking your talking points from your democrat masters.",
