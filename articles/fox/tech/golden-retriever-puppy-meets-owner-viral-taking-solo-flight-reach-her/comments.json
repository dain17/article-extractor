So I let her in then took her to the manager who I knew loved dogs and asked her to keep her until I came home from work and she said, \"of course!\". She was a stunningly beautiful dog with a face that could melt the iciest of hearts. Turns out she was half wolf, a hybrid. She was way too smart and cunning for me to know how to handle (at least I can admit it, eh?) so after about a year I had to find her a new home.",

The Shepard loved the sliding board and was hilarious to watch. He'd beg to be let off leash and when I did he'd run over and climb the 10 or so ladder steps. I'd tell him to \"Get Down\" and he'd start down sliding on his claws, jumping and stumbling at the bottom. Run around and climb back up again. :) . I recommend a book called \"Water Dog\" to anyone wanting to train their dog. People always ask when to start training and answers vary.
