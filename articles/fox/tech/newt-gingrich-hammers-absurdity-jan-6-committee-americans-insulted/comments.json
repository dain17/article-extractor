Trump kept both China and Russia on their heels and in-check and nervous about America's power in the World.

I mean, would the Trump that achieved all of these seemingly \"impossible\" positive accomplishments have sent a guy dressed as a cross between Chewbacca and a Viking into the Capitol Building as his \"trump\" card for overthrowing the election???

        "context": "The division in America today began with Newt Gingrich 38 years ago. In 1984 Newt took control of a group called GOPAC and trained an army of mini-Newts to run for office. He told them to refer to Democrats as “pro-communist and un-American” and to describe them as “anti-flag traitors”.\nNewt’s tactics had a corrosive effect on the way Congress operated. Thomas Mann of The Brookings Institution said, “he took a wrecking ball to the most powerful and influential legislature in the world and all but ended bi-partisan cooperation.”",
