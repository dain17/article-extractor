You see, China doesn't tolerate CRT, all 56-59 ethnic groups live in harmony (with some who want to separate from China), no LGBT in all PLA military units, no inclusiveness, no social experimentation, and no mixed gender in any unit, either all male or all female soldiers!

The right-leaning media (Fox among them) is reporting that the migrants caused the citizens to go berserk and freak out as they thought of them as trash.
