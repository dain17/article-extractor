Have you seen all of the available online drugs for sale for a far cheaper price than pharma generic drugs. The cartels already produce fentanyl dirt cheap. With a wide open border their transportation costs are minuscule. Customs and Border Patrol might interdict less than 10% of all shipments. With these economic realities evident to the cartels and the profound greed of the US drug companies evident to everyone but you, there is no way legal drug outlets could compete with the cartels. PS…the new high potency pot products are being studied, and the results are not good. The new high potency products are being shown to produce long term psychosis as well as other persistent mental deficiencies in habitual users. That’s what happens when drugs are legalized.
