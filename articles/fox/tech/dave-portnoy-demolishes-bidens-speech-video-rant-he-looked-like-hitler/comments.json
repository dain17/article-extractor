(The first wake-up call, of course, was the Mar a Lago raid.) Both spectacles screamed one thing, and one thing only: \"We are now in complete and total control.\"\n\nYou'll see. The Party's hostile takeover of America will play out in three acts. Act One will be the expansion of the Party's legislative power in November, Act Two will be the expansion of the SCOTUS to thirteen seats in January, and Act Three will be the arrest and public execution of Donald Trump, de facto leader of the anti-Party movement. Then comes social credit, 24/7 surveillance of every citizen, widespread military raids of deep-red territory, and Reeducation and Reconditioning Facilities (i.e. forced labor camps) for dissenters. Then the transformation of America into a proxy state for Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party will officially be complete.",
