I'll look into those claims about defense not having access to the videos as well as the claims that people have been arrested, jailed, and given long sentences for minor offenses.\n\nRE the videos you mention, YES, I saw all those videos on or right after January 6. Police standing by while people walked in (not sure about seeing them holding the door open), people standing around taking pics, et cetera. I am aware that many people were just swept along in the moment without having the nefarious intent that others did. And I'm hopeful that they would receive a light sentence (for trespassing) or none at all. But those who fought with police, destroyed property, or literally broke in to the building should all be convicted, IMO.\n\nHowever, the intent of those in charge (Trump & Co, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers) was definitely to interfere with the election such that Donald Trump would remain president. Those people were literally insurrectionists by deed and intent, even if the mob in totality didn't reflect that. Now, were some of the violent members of the crowd just angry that the \"vote had been stolen\"? Undoubtedly. But that doesn't take anything away from the literal insurrectionists.",

Nobody knows because no investigation has ever been held. It was \"reviewed\" by a democrat \"investigator\" in Georgia who found that everything was OK. As for the court cases, no case was ever adjudicated. Every court, including SCOTUS, refused to hear anything relating to election interference based on procedural grounds. In other words, no adversarial court hearings to present and rebut evidence were ever held. Those are just a few of the things that make me go HMMMM.\nI'm not saying that election interference cost Trump the election, I'm saying that no comprehensive investigation was ever held to determine whether it did or not.

In terms of the smaller states being ignored, they might not get as many candidate visits, but they would still have access through the media to all candidate speeches and communiques.\nI'm sure it will never happen, but I hope we don't get to the place where the minority has ALL the power. . . .\n\nI read about 2000 Mules. Did you hear about the lawsuit against the makers? I believe it was announced yesterday or today.\n\nI would love to chat again. Thanks for the positive vibes; they are so welcome.",

The term I've heard before referring to a \"true\" democracy (1 vote per person) is \"the tyranny of the majority\". The Electoral College was designed to give the minority a say in picking the Prez. \nI haven't heard about any lawsuits in reference to the movie...I'll have to do some research. Having watched the movie, I can't see anything there that would open any liability to the makers, but in today's litigious-crazy society, I guess pretty much anybody can sue anybody for anything, so I wouldn't be surprised. Prevailing of course, is another matter. If you get a chance, watch it. It may not change your mind or convince you of their premise, but is good food for thought.\n\nChat again soon...",

I have heard the same thing about \"the tyranny of the majority,\" but I would rather have a government guided by the opinions of the majority than those of the minority:-)! \n\nThe element that keeps me from shunning a true democracy is the fact that that \"majority\" is not a fixed entity; the numbers of people will change based on the person they vote for. And their thoughts and feelings will change as well, based on the efficacy of the presidential candidate's presentation, AND the successes or failures of the incumbent. \n\nLet's say that we had a true democracy in 2016, and Hillary won. After four years, her leadership wasn't all that her voters had hoped, and the majority of the country were more impressed by a Republican's ideas in 2020. They vote for a Republican. . . .\n\nOf course, for a true democracy to occur, we would have to change the way the senate is configured as well since the \"two senators per state\" doesn't yield true representation. A true representation would currently yield somewhere around 60/40, Democrat/Republican.\n\nCheers!",

I can see that festering into a recipe for disaster. \nThe Senate would be a mess. The actual breakdown is Democrats: 30% of registered voters, Republicans: 24% of registered voters, Independents: 43% of registered voters.

To your first point, I'm not sure about the 51% to 49% figure. When looking at generalized ideology, I'm thinking that it's closer to 60% to 40%, or maybe 55% to 45% left-leaning to right-leaning. Hard figure to come to, but I do believe that MOST of the independents lean left. \n\nTo your point about the minority being bossed around by the majority, I come back to my point that this is much better than the major decisions made by the MINORITY who lead 51% to 49% -- something that could easily happen in the next election. (And I'm looking at the Senate here.) But speaking of the Senate, if the new Forward party takes hold, it could help to break up any logjams; I see it as potentially more of a positive rather than the mess you see.\n\nBTW, the actual lopsided percentage with Trump/Clinton was 48% Clinton to 46% Trump, and we know who won. \n\nRE your cities point, could you explain a bit more? I don't see how a true democracy would negatively impact different sized cities.\n\nHope you're having a good one!",

The damage is the same as if a news anchor spoke the lies.]\n\nI'm not sure how to reply to your examples without knowing more details, but the actual words you quote seem like semantic distinctions.

As far as I can tell, NO news company is covering this as extensively as it deserves.\n\nAbout your point that we need opposing views to have a good debate, I'm not so sure. I think what ALL news sources need is a dedication to fact and evidence-based journalism. Fox and other right-leaning sources often misinform, discuss lies as if they're truth, and actually lie themselves. IF we had opposing views on major issues, are you talking about someone who believes the election was stolen vs. someone who knows it wasn't? Should we give false information and erroneous beliefs equal airtime? \n\nJust one point/question about your \"open border.\" As far as I know, it's not any more \"open\" than it's been for the last 50 years, excepting Trump & Biden's COVID policy (that was recently stopped) and Trump's separation of families. . . . What do you mean by \"open\" border? \n\nThe migrants Biden is sending to different states are either unaccompanied minors going to relatives or guardians . . . or adults being moved to different shelters that are less crowded. RE migrants not being vaccinated, apparently that has changed as of 5/2022. While humans have the right not to be vaccinated, if a migrant refuses vaccination, they are either deported or fitted with ankle bracelets and monitored closely (if they are legitimate asylum seekers).",

Lo and behold, I found what I often find with the less reputable sources -- they misinterpret, misinform, and are simply not credible. \n\nWhat did Stephens actually say in his July 21 NYT article?  \"To this day, precious few anti-Trumpers have been honest with themselves about the elaborate hoax ‚Äî there's just no other word for it ‚Äî that was the Steele dossier and all the bogus allegations, credulously parroted in the mainstream media, that flowed from it.\" \n\nAs you can see, he's not globalizing to the entire Russian collusion story; he's just talking about the Steele dossier.

Tucker Carlsons show is not hard news and is opinion. And it is clearly offered and presented as such.\nFlynn never showed any documentation as to where any fox lawyer stated: \" no reasonable person believes that Tucker Carlson is providing literal factual information.\" he only repeated that claim. You are correct in that I still don't believe Flynn, or you, for that matter. As no such facts were presented by either of you\nA true left wingnut liberal not only cannot accept facts, but They also cannot accept that words have actual definitions. They do not mean whatever you chose to believe they mean.",

Therefore, it is not subject to a tort action. And suit was thrown out.\nOr in what I believe you are referring to is that fox lawyers may have stated something to the effect of that no reasonable person would look at what Carlson actually said and believe that he PRESENTED IT AS A PROVEN FACT, that is not the same thing.\nPlease once again, I know this concept is very hard for you, show me exactly that where you found that fox lawyers stated this \" Fox lawyers argued that no reasonable person believes that Tucker Carlson is providing literal factual information\". I will admit \" Tucker uses exaggeration and hyperbole\". Tucker Carlsons show is not hard news and is opinion. And it is clearly offered as such. Still waiting.",
