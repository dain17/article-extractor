The incumbent prevailed — but not by much.\nA few weeks earlier, Vos acknowledged that he’d received a phone call from the former Republican president, urging him to help undo the results of the 2020 election. As it turns out, it wasn’t just news organizations who took an interest in that chat. NBC News reported this morning:\nThe Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly who was targeted by former President Donald Trump, last weekend for testimony about a phone call he received from the former president in July. The panel is seeking Vos’ testimony by Monday, but the Wisconsin lawmaker is suing to block the subpoena.",
