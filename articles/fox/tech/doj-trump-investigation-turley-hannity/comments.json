When something is put out, that is Classified, whether Top Secret, Secret or Confidential, when it is Declassified, the markings on the pieces of paper don‚Äôt magically disappear. Also, the only person who is (normally) allowed to declassify a Classified Item is called the Original Classification Authority, that is the Person or Entity that originally Classified the Item in Question. The ONLY exception to that, is the President of the United States. He is sometimes called the Ultimate Classification Authority, as he has the power to Declassify ANYTHING in the Government. The Definitions for these are SUPPOSED to be: Top Secret ‚Äì Information whose disclosure will cause Exceptionally Grave Damage to the United States of America, Secret ‚Äì Information whose disclosure will cause grave damage to the United States of America, and Confidential ‚Äì Information whose disclosure will cause damage to the United States of America.

I‚Äôm not sure if it has changed by now but the GDS required documents to be declassified on a timetable and unless a reason existed to keep them classified they were declassified. This applied to ALL classified documents.\nFrankly the only thing that matters is if this posed a real threat to national security. Absent that this is much ado about nothing.\nI would refer you to the hacked server with classified info found in Hillary‚Äôs closet. Huma Abadan‚Äôs laptop with classified emails which was backed up to Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop. Also lets not forget Bill Clinton‚Äôs former National Security Advisor caught stuffing classified documents down his pants in the National Archives.\nI hope you were outraged then as you are now.\nRather than being consumed with hate for one person I would think this country would be better served with the fair and equal application of the law.",

They could have found an Abrams tank, an Apache helicopter, and a tactical nuclear weapon on the compound, and Trump lackeys would try to somehow justify it as a DOJ witch hunt. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before Trump finally dug his own grave. Personally, I want the DOJ to nail him to the wall for defrauding the gov't and election fraud. I'm a lifelong Republican, but I tossed Trump in the dumpster like all Republicans should have done after his delusional election conspiracy theory, his scheme to overturn the election, and his dereliction of duty once he was informed that Jan06 protestors were armed.",

As he stated, \"they're not here to harm me.\"\nAt that moment in time when Trump was first informed of rally goers being armed with weapons, Trump should have placed two phone calls to the Sec of Defense and the AG and had the entire Capitol Complex locked down and swarming with agents from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Secret Service, U.S. Marshals, etc. and the DC National Guard.

From this reality, they understand that convincing a judge is only a tiny element in the attack against Trump. The greater requirement is to create a narrative that either convinces the far right of Trump‚Äôs alleged criminal activity (not likely), or the government will necessarily have to undermine, discredit or fully disenfranchise a potentially dangerous and large section of the American population. The game now is information operations. The government understands that faced with violence or penalty, people are generally weak and easily manipulated into submission. Native Americans, black slaves and Jews can attest to this truth. This time it will be white, middle and lower class republicans. White republicans have no stomach for contesting what will be demanded of them. They will not fight as their forefathers did. \n\nIf the government is successful in prosecuting Trump, his supporters will put their heads down and butts up and submit to government subjugation. Trump‚Äôs white supporters will surrender to the dominate power as has every group since this continent was colonized. We are seeing the beginning of retaliatory strikes against the white, conservative majority.  \nWhen they come for you, you will roll over like every group of people has done in the entire history of this particular ‚Äúrepublic.‚Äù Your America is no more.

I can't wait for 2025 when Biden's house with be crawling with agents finding documents about his influence peddling for 30 years. if we had term limits he would have long been forgotten.  The only way to \"fix\" our country is to put term limits for Congress. Then most of our leaders wouldn't be a bunch of old men (and Nancy) most from California and New York. ",
