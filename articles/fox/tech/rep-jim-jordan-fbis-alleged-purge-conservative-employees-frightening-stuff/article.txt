Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said an FBI whistleblower who spoke with his office has been suspended Thursday on "Hannity."Â 

Which is always the first step in terminating someone at the FBI, and now we think that there has been specific retaliation against a whistle-blower who has been suspended and this is one of the very first whistle-blowers we had who's been suspended. He came to us back last fall with the school boards issue. We learn that memo randomly came from attorney general Garland designed to say we're going to use the counterterrorism measures against moms and dads and 20 some parents were investigated by the FBI for simple showing up at a school board meeting, so it continues to escalate and then when you view it in context of everything we are doing, this is frightening stuff.
