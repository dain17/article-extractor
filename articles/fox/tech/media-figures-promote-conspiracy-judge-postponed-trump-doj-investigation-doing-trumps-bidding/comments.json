The special master was unnecessary since the documents had already been filtered to take out any potential atty-client documents. Moreover, the judge's reasoning could be applied to virtually any crime searches, how does the party of law&order feel about that?! Furthermore and perhaps most important, legal experts questioned the view that Trump might have executive privilege claims. The executive privilege claim is almost certain to be overturned upon appeal.  In the end this will be just another delay tactic that Trump has down to a science.  Anyone of us would be in jail by now.  The decision further erodes the public's view of equal justice for all.  ",

Chief Justice Warren Burger said that the President didn‚Äôt have an absolute, unqualified privilege to withhold information.\n‚ÄúWe conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial,‚Äù Burger said.",
