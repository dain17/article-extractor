Thus, they have no vested interest in how our tax dollars are spent. They vote simply for whoever promises to place another chicken in their pot. Politicians know this. Therefore, politicians who operate in this manner are actually misappropriating our tax dollars for their individual benefit. There is a very simple fix here to stop this growing trend. If an individual is on public assistance and not one hundred percent disabled, require that to stay on the assistance they must also work. The along places more individuals into the workforce. More importantly, it takes away the politician's ability to buy votes through their heartless promises of simply giving away more tax dollars. COVID money was a great example of this. It alone paid people more money to stay home than a lot of them made on the job. Shifting contractual debt from borrowers to taxpayers also takes away the need for a job. A great example of this is the college loan forgiveness program. It is also another attempt to buy votes. IF YOU WANT TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE - YOU MUST BE A TAXPAYER PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM YOU ARE HELPING TO DEFRAUD WITH YOUR VOTES AIMED AT POLITICIANS WHO PROMISE THREE CARS IN EVERY GARAGE, WHETHER YOU WORK OR NOT.

This is always followed by rehiring attempts in the next quarter.\nThe reason there is a worker shortage is that during Covid, Corporate America gutted their work forces to maintain profit, showed that workers didn't matter to them, and now no ones wants to go back at the same wage  prices with no stability, no quality of life, no hope of retiring, no hope of owning a home, and no hope of a better life for their children.",

It became a means to employ those with a degree in Humanities, foreign language, and even mathematics ... the ones who didn't want to teach in k-12 schools or didn't want to work in the private sector. My point, NONSENSE! As for healthcare, because we have Medicare and Medicaid the fees charged have gone up. Please notice what happened when Obamacare was passed, \"We will find out what's in the Bill when it passes\" as stated by a Democrat Nancy Pelosi and what was found out was the costs continued to die even faster, but now select groups were allowed to enter at lower rates which by the way soon caught up with what they paid before. As for healthcare, well, they couldn't handle Covid so we needed a 15 day lockdown! Strange, every time the Democrats and even Republicans throw money at a problem it becomes a more costly problem!",
