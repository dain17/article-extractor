Our national debt may be at a shocking $30 trillion, but that's actually a rosier picture than what our real debt is.  When you account for unfunded entitlements our national debt is over $126 trillion.  The reason the treasury claims that the debt is $30 trillion and not $126 trillion is that it claims recipients have no right to future payments; they only have rights to claims through current entitlement laws.  That means if you're retired now, they don't consider what they owe next year as part of the debt, because what they owe you next year could be taken away with a change to the law.  Normal people and companies aren't allowed to do accounting this way, because we can't change the law to get out of our debts; the only way out of our debts is to declare bankruptcy and to accept a court-appointed financial manager to manage and disperse our assets to creditors (except for student loans which cannot be renegotiated under Chapter 11).",

What Facebook does though is selectively edit posts and comments to keep the ones that support their politics and delete the ones that don't--then they try to claim that they're just a neutral platform and hide behind section 230.  If Facebook edits the content in your feed to remove negative content about a political figure that they support then they are not a neutral platform--they are a publisher, and therefore not protected under section 230.",

They claim this immunity because they claim that everyone has a right to post their thoughts on their website and they are not responsible for those posts.  But if they're editing this content to support one view over another, then they are not a telecommunications company like AT&T and are instead closer to being a publisher like MSNBC or Fox News and therefore not protected under section 230.  Blake Masters is not saying that Facebook *has* to publish what he posts, he's saying that if they do edit those posts because they disagree with his politics then they can't at the same time claim to be a neutral telecommunications company with total immunity under section 230.  Here's a totally different example, there are laws defining how a non-profit company must operate in order to get the tax benefits of being a non-profit.  If they want to become a for-profit company, great, they can do that, but they can't still claim non-profit status.",
