What's interesting is the Clinton campaign denied that they funded the Steele dossier. That denial was even made to Congress when investigators asked campaign officials in the presence of their general counsel, Marc Elias, and reporters later accused Elias and others of hiding that fact. But what we have now is a much more complete picture of how they did get this scandal into the bloodstream, how they worked the media, how they worked, friends in the FBI. And now we find out that the FBI not only funded Steele himself or actually paid Steele himself rather than fund it, but also paid his main source. Now, the key here is that the Steele dossier has never been established as true, and American intelligence quickly threw flags up that they thought this could be Russian disinformation coming through the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign.
