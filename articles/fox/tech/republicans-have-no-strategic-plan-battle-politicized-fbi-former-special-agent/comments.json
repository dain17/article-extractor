Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) delayed Congress’s electoral ballot count in January 2005 by objecting to a valid slate of votes legally submitted. She was Josh Hawley before Josh Hawley. Boxer and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio) alleged the election had been stolen in Ohio — that voting machines had been corrupted by George W. Bush’s people. Sen. Boxer also expressed regret that she had not objected to the electoral count in 2000 because she felt the Supreme Court and Florida had illicitly boosted Bush. \nNovember 6, 2018, Abrams was a whopping 68,000 votes behind Republican Brian Kemp with 99 percent of precincts reported. Yet for 10 days she did not admit she had lost. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said the election was stolen and called for a federal government investigation and that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris said Kemp won due to voter suppression. Abrams’ effort to overthrow a legitimate election was spearheaded by the Voter Access Institute (VAI), which claimed Democrats’ votes were not counted or switched by corrupted voting machines.",

Played out well in the press for Cruz but many of us could see what was going on and it was disturbing. Would also say his choice of Carly tells independents that he has very little economic sense. Carly almost single handedly took out HP. She was one of the worst CEOs in modern history but he took her for one reason and one reason only which adds to his insincere image. All about power for him. No need to go into the final thing we all know what he did and if you try to defend it you simply are unwilling to look beyond political blinders.

Trump states that his defense is that the FBI planted the top secret documents recovered, but then when asked to back that statement up, Trump pleads to the judge to not make him swear by his statements.

He was shot in the back twice in the early morning near his home. He died later in the hospital. The police recorded the event as a robbery and yet Rich’s phone, wallet, and personal items were with him when the police arrived.\nSome people suspect Rich was the source of the emails that went to WikiLeaks before the 2016 Election related to Hillary and her corrupt actions over many years. These emails were ignored by the corrupt mainstream media but were shared by Wikileaks and on social media at that time.\nA short time after Seth Rich’s death, the Russia collusion story was created. It’s also suspected in certain circles that the Russia collusion story was created to keep eyes off of Seth Rich’s murder.\nThe FBI denied any information or files related to the Seth Rich murder.

You know you haven't intentionally done anything wrong, you tell them to pound sand, the agent smiles.  He then puts in front of you a copy of your parents most recent mortgage application, where they did a cash out and on the application your parents indicated the cash they were asking for was to replace the roof.  He than shows you a bank statement where they paid for the roof replacement, a well, and for some dental work.  He explains to you they clearly lied on the application and since they received the funds as a wire transfer they are both looking at 10 years in prison if they lose, or 10's or 100's of thousands in legal expenses to try to remain free.
