This also does not mean that I actively encourage atherosclerosis or that I hold rallies praising cholesterol or heart attacks.  No heart disease patient celebrates their disease- their recovery and survival, yes, but not the actual disease.\n\nPro-choicers are always telling us abortion is simply a medical procedure.  Putting aside the fact that a cholesterol plaque has 0% chance of ever being born into a human, why then do these pro-choicers glorify the \"disease\" of pregnancy and it's \"necessary treatment?\"  Shouldn't they hope to never NEED to have an abortion?  Their arguments are completely without logic.\n\nI happen to be reluctantly pro-choice, but I absolutely do not think it's a benign, victimless medical procedure or that a fetus is no different than a tumor.  Yes, an embryo or an early stage fetus is not as valuable as a born human life, but it's not NOTHING.  Women have been the nurturing life-givers of civilization for all of human history.

Birth Control, most offered and available free.  Now, the morning after pills.  Easily obtained, many options for free.  \nHuman life begins at conception, all constitutional rights are guaranteed.

She knew that I was a preacher and said that she needed to talk with me. Her father and boyfriend had both pressured her into having an abortion. She didn’t want to go through with it but, like many young women, she felt that she had no choice. Her regret and anguish was heartbreaking. I prayed with her and spent time listening to her. I assured her that Jesus still loves her and it seemed to help that she could share her feelings of guilt without being judged by the listener. A few days later, one of our regular customers, a mean and bitter lady, was bragging to another customer in line about her work with the local abortion clinic. I overheard the conversation and pointed out to her about the terrible after effects many women go through. She looked me right in the eye and said that she had never heard of such. I asked my young employee to tell her about the experience that she was going through. The old bitty shut up. She also never came back to our restaurant. That was fine with me. The young lady told me that telling her story to an abortion activist helped her even more and that she was determined to tell other women about the aftermath of having killed your child. I’ve since been told by other women their stories of having constant nightmares where they could hear their child crying or asking them why they were killed, why didn’t they love them. If a woman has an even partially functioning soul, they will experience extreme guilt, loss and heartbreak. Sadly, many have taken their own lives because of their feelings of guilt. These are issues you never hear from the evil democrats. ",

This makes it even more imperative to give financial incentives not only to abort, but also give those same financial incentives to BOTH women AND men to exercise CONTROL over their bodies.\n\nTherefore, in states which allow abortion, women within those states NEED FREE ABORTIONS.  For women outside those states who want abortions, provide transportation subsidies.  Also, as part of the abortion procedure, pay those same women a FINANCIAL BONUS TO VOLUNTARILY undergo sterilization.  That way, the burden of future generations of \"social parasites\" can be LIMITED, if not totally eliminated.\n\nThe same financial incentives can be offered to men to CHOOSE to exercise their right and undergo permanent vasectomies.\n\nCombined, future generations of undesirables will eventually dwindle down to a manageable number.\n\n\"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for their crimes or let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.\" (Buck v.
