Here's the actual sentence in the Mueller Report: \"While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election (227).\" \nSo they found lots of facts, but they didn't find enough to CHARGE anyone. As I stated above, \"because many people took the 5th, evaded interviews, or hid/concealed electronic evidence. RE obstruction, Mueller had enough to charge Trump but didn't because of the informal tenet that one does not charge a sitting president.\" The Senate Intelligence Committe found more \"facts\" that showed Manafort and Stone's connections with Russians to be particularly troubling, and they found \"\"a breathtaking level of contacts between Trump officials and Russian government operatives. . . .\"",

They were not looking at criminality, but they did see what they found as evidence of collusion. \"This is what collusion looks like\" was one statement by a member. \nThe fact that Roger Stone was convicted of lying to congress about his associations with Wikileaks (and the Russia connection) is just one bit of common sense evidence for collusion. Ask yourself this, if NOTHING was going on, why were there so many contacts between Russia and Trump folks?
