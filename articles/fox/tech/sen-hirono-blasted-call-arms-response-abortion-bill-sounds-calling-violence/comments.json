This limits the procreation of future generations of \"Undesirables.\"  These Undesirables become \"net takers\" rather than net contributors.\n\nSo, with reversal of \"Roe\" and \"Casey,\" abortion will still be legal in some states.  This makes it even more imperative to give financial incentives not only to abort, but also give those same financial incentives to BOTH women AND men to exercise CONTROL over their bodies.\n\nTherefore, in states which allow abortion, women within those states NEED FREE ABORTIONS.  For women outside those states who want abortions, provide transportation subsidies.  Also, as part of the abortion procedure, pay those same women a FINANCIAL BONUS TO VOLUNTARILY undergo sterilization.  That way, the burden of future generations of \"social parasites\" can be LIMITED, if not totally eliminated.\n\nThe same financial incentives can be offered to men to CHOOSE to exercise their right and undergo permanent vasectomies.\n\nCombined, future generations of undesirables will eventually dwindle down to a manageable number.\n\n\"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for their crimes or let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.\" (Buck v.

As always, the MAGA Republicans know they can't win a popular vote, so they try to suppress the popular vote by any means necessary, in this case by trying to use an asinine “formatting error\" excuse.\n\nOh, and the Michigan Supreme Court thoroughly slapped down that MAGA Republican attempt to prevent Michiganders from voting on abortion rights... the abortion rights referendum WILL be on the November ballot in Michigan.\n\nMAGA Republicans claim that the abortion issue should be decided by the states.
