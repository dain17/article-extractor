Brought it in and landed it, got out and realized the entire wing was gone.  \n\nDon't pilots study things like this?  This plane only lost an engine.  Should have been able to open the throttle full blast and make the runway, correcting for one lost engine!\n\nBut then... I'm not a pilot...\n\nThankful to hear nobody was killed.",
