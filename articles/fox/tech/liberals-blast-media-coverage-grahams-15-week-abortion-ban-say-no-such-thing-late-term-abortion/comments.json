Biology and genetics recognize that an individual, living human is produced at the moment of fertilization.  That's the science.  Legally, each individual is innocent until proven guilty.  That's the law.  Abortion is intentional termination of pregnancy by the destruction of the unborn human.  So, once again, this is the intentional killing of an innocent human.  You want to pretend this is a \"private medical decision,\" but the intentional killing of an innocent human is not a right anyone possesses, privately or otherwise, and less than 5% of abortions are performed due to medical necessity.\n\n\"And you don't really care about science, rights or facts, what you want is for big government to force the rest of Americans to follow your religious position on this issue.\"\n\nScience, law, history, logic and ethics are all on my side here.  I haven't made any religious argument, but I'm not surprised you are going to pretend otherwise.  It's essentially an admission that you have no rational rebuttal - just projection, dishonesty and absurd hypocrisy.  The right to life of innocent humans is a fundamental right, meaning it is one of the most basic concepts government is required to protect, so your \"big government\" squealing is laughable.  \n\n\"Don't tread on me!\"\n\nWhy should you not be trod upon, pro-abortion fanatic?",

        "context": "There is NOTHING WRONG with abortion if performed OFTEN ENOUGH AND ON THE RIGHT PEOPLE.  This limits the procreation of future generations of \"Undesirables.\"  These Undesirables become \"net takers\" rather than net contributors.\n\nSo, with reversal of \"Roe\" and \"Casey,\" abortion will still be legal in some states.  This makes it even more imperative to give financial incentives not only to abort, but also give those same financial incentives to BOTH women AND men to exercise CONTROL over their bodies.\n\nTherefore, in states which allow abortion, women within those states NEED FREE ABORTIONS.  For women outside those states who want abortions, provide transportation subsidies.  Also, as part of the abortion procedure, pay those same women a FINANCIAL BONUS TO VOLUNTARILY undergo sterilization.  That way, the burden of future generations of \"social parasites\" can be LIMITED, if not totally eliminated.\n\nThe same financial incentives can be offered to men to CHOOSE to exercise their right and undergo permanent vasectomies.\n\nCombined, future generations of undesirables will eventually dwindle down to a manageable number.\n\n\"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for their crimes or let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.\" (Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 208 (1927), majority opinion written by Associate Justice of the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.)",

The truth of the matter is that most reasonable people (90% of the country) agree that there should be some restrictions.  Pick a time frame and let move on.  It cannot be \"Zero abortions\" just as it cannot be \"Full Term abortions\".  Why can't we meet in the middle.  15 weeks, or 16 weeks, pick a time and move on.  The other real issue, is who should pay for this procedure.  I don't think that the tax payers should pay for any of this.  However, I am willing to compromise, so we can move on.  Tax payers pay for the first one, and after that, you are on your own.  I suspect that reasonable people (not Politian's) could solve all of our problems.....but I digress.",

As you said there were some complications but they eventually were overcome. There are some, that will NEVER be overcome.\n\nWhy should government (state or federal) dictate a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution?\n\nDoes the government (state or federal) know the personal, private, intimate, HIPAA protected conversations that your god-child's mother and physician discussed? I doubt it, unless you were presented with a subpoena which would be the only way someone outside of the physician and the woman would be able to obtain access to those discussions.\n\nRepublicans cried about HIPAA when the failed vaccine mandate was talked about, that it wasn't anyone's business whether or not a person was vaccinated. So why doesn't this apply in this situation?\n\nAn abortion is a medical procedure, performed by a medically professionally certified OB/GYN physician. If a simple shot in the arm is enough for Republicans to cry about \"personal medical history\", shouldn't us Democrats cry foul when it is about what is or isn't \"growing\" inside a woman's body?",

The father signed the same papers and disappeared the second he heard she was pregnant.\n\nMinutes after the baby is born, the doctors find a serious problem in it, that can only be treated with a tissue transplant from the mother. No other donor is available, and the baby will die within minutes without the procedure. The mother refuses.\n\nCan the mother be legally forced to donate the tissue for the transplant that will save the baby's life?",
