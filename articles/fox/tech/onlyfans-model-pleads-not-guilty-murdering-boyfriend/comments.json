This is an unusual case because he didn't really fight back, and ultimately, the crazy-B murdered him.  Domestic violence is not what the PR campaigns would have you believe:  Men are violent, women are victims, see something, say something.  Fact is, women are just as violent, many times are the instigator, but don't normally fair well in \"mutual combat\" with a man.  I've seen the most docile, peace loving man lose his everlovin mind at the hands of a violent, button pushing, relentless woman.  Women!  Keep your hands to yourself!
