Venezuela was once the wealthiest Country in South America today its the poorest....Socialism. This is what they want for America, turn it into a 3rd World Country. The Government has been grooming minority races for decades giving them \"free\" everything so they will be completely dependent upon them, take a look around sheep are so easily \"controlled\" isn't this why the Feds/States won't let THEIR China virus go away??

Then, they could begin by denying any public funds for illegals (SNAP, welfare, unemployment, rent subsidy, etc), as well as any hope of \"a path to citizenship.\" And then, they liberals could start building more border wall (as opposed to fighting it in court every step of the way).\n\nYeah; There's work to be done alright... and democrats are not only not doing it...
