If someone wants to pack up my family and send us on an all-expenses paid trip to Martha's Vineyard we'd be thrilled. \n\nBut the TRUTH of the matter is that DeSantis, just like Abbott are trying to make a HUGE POINT to Biden, Harris and the entire DemocRATic party. We have a serious \"security\" problem at our southern border. VP Harris was assigned the crisis at our border as her \"one and only\" job shortly after taking office. And she has failed miserably. Maybe if she actually went to the border (where it's the worst - instead of a fringe area) she could have witnessed first hand the troubles. But she doesn't care, and obviously neither does Biden. So, you want to see a miniscule fraction of what is going on at our southern border...they're giving you a taste.",

The group then boarded three waiting buses that drove off about 50 minutes later.\nOne bus traveled to the Walt Whitman Service Area in Cherry Hill, NJ, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. After the bus pulled up at around 12:45 a.m. Friday, several teens disembarked, retrieved their bags from the luggage compartment and left with adults who were waiting there to meet them.\nThe bus left the rest stop around 1:05 a.m. and continued south on the New Jersey Turnpike.\nThe plane that landed in Westchester flew out of El Paso International Airport in Texas and made a stopover in Jacksonville, Fla., online flight records show.\nIn October, The Post documented a series of similar flights to reveal how the government was flying migrant teens to suburban New York amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis at the Mexican border.",

The federal government should be relocating migrants based on population and not expect border states to bear the brunt of the financial drain - and if they won‚Äôt, well‚Ä¶.2) where was complaint when the fed govt DID fly in migrants and drop them in the middle of the night? 3) where‚Äôs outrage when fed govt drops groups off in tiny AZ towns with no services? 4) if you call yourself a sanctuary city/state, then you invite it. We border states should NOT bear the costs of this open border policy!! AND these migrants are not forced, rather asked, if this move is either where they want to go or closer. The point being the Federal Government should be dispersing fairly, everywhere, IMO. Better yet, close the border, deal with backlog fast and have immigration courts right at the border, there and then. Other countries are WAY ahead of us, and tougher than us, on their borders. Not buying millions and millions of valid asylum seekers!",
