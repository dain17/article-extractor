I have a relative who couldn't enlist or be drafted because he had a bunion on his right foot by the big toe, and a hammer toe.  Clinton was draftable, having registered the same year as Trump.  He had taken advantage of college deferments which were cancelled.  He relentlessly ppursued ways to get out of the draft.  First, he had a Democrat influencial uncle try to get him off, than others.  Further proof of his draft dodging, is in his letter he wrote thanking Colonel Holmes, head of the ROTC program at Arkansas University for helping him: \"First, I want to thank you, NOT JUST FOR SAVING ME FROM THE DRAFT, but for being so kind.....\"  written in 1969.  Colonel Holmes later wrote about it, included in the Congressional Record, saying he was deceived by Clinton when he promised he would enroll in Arkansas Univeristy Law School & join it's ROTC program.  He never kept his promises and went to England to attend Oxford, where he made public speeches that he was against the American draft, no one should be drafted, & should avoid the draft.  Colonel Holmes said Clinton betrayed him, the Armed Services & his country, with his broken promises & oversea's attacks. ",

All they are interested in is technology and $$$. I am a teacher, writer, former librarian and I have over 5K books in my personal library. NONE of my kids are interested in them and, what is worse, most libraries I contact aren't interested either. For most people the past (and I include people in that term) is nothing but a burden. Letter-writing is a lost art. Future historians will not be able to write the history of our times because of emails/texts that are deleted.",
