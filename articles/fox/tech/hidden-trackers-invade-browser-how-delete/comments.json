Now android makes you go thru multiple steps to turn internet on/off. There's also airplane mode, but it shuts off incoming text and calls also\nI try to NEVER use apps because apps take up extra resources on the phone, and they often advertise to you in ways you can't stop them.    In version 10, I was elated that I gained ability to shut an app off from the internet altogether ! Unfortunately, I had to upgrade to a 5G phone. Now in Android 12  we're back to NOT being able to control internet at the APP level.  There really does need to be some laws about giving users certain controls over their phone.  For now, it's 1,2,3,4,5...off.Of COURSE, the fact we can even turn off internet is a blessing! That's a dinosaur from the days when everyone got charged per kilobyte.\nI don't know if there was a law in place that required ability to turn off internet or if they just did it out of practicality. I suppose airplane mode will always exist. But that's like removing a kidney with a sledgehammer when you'd much prefer a scalpel.\n It can definitely get worse....Try turning off internet to your Xbox and you have nothing but a paperweight!  \nI suppose, when it gets to the point of  being unacceptable, I'll have to pay someone to root my phone and load an alternate operating system...but I'm not quite there yet.",
