The Federalist senior editor Chris Bedford explained why Americans should be holding the Justice Department and FBI accountable after the Mar-a-Lago raid on "The Ingraham Angle." 

We should demand answers. The onus is absolutely on them. And I like how the Democratic Party has changed from one that questions the FBI forever to one that now just does their bidding, because the FBI seems to be working with them. Right now the plurality of Independents, according to polling, and the majority of Republicans are saying, "Hold on, FBI. The ball's in your court. You show us what you have because right now, we don’t trust you."
