I thought Joe would figure something else out instead of turning tail like the reds wanted.\n\nBut the other reality is that there was no way to exit this gracefully. The reds got us into the region illegally. The reds corporations at the defense department got rich. The mid east civilians suffered the most. Qrange promised a surrender that Joe had to abide by. And finally, the reds got us scurrying out and running.\n\nThat's the reality of it.",
