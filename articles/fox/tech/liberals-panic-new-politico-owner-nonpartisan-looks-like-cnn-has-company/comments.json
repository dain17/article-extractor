We saw this when Elon Musk offered to buy twitter.  The left freaked over his promise to stop political censorship on the platform.  The left freaked out so much they removed Tesla from the ESG index.  They removed the largest electric car company from a sustainability index 😄😁😆😅. All because Musk promised to stop censoring political view points on twitter if the sale went through.  The left is also freaking out about CNN becoming less biased.  Many on the left have lived in a political self affirming bubble.  Where dissent isn't tolerated.  Colleges are a good example of this.  Ann Coulter couldn't even speak at Berkeley.  She was invited by the Berkeley Republicans club to speak at the university.   The speech was shut down by protests.  I'm not a fan of Ann Coulter but this tactic has been used to silence conservative speakers at other Universities.  The left has shown over and over again thier disdain for any unapproved view points.  The left has even likened political speech to violence.  \"Words are violence\" is a tactic to control political speech. What the left is doing to stifle political speech is insidious and wrong.  These tendencies on the left to only allow  approved narratives shows their aspirations are based in fascism.",

As their parents ran in circles after the big houses, boats used a few days a year, very expensive cars, that were parked most of the time in front of places they worked way to much to afford them, and they rest of the paraphernalia needed to climb the societal ladder.\nFox is blowing the other media outlets out of the water viewer wise. I do not believe they are much better morally then the other, but they keep the focus on the foundational stuff; family, education, the economy, and the security of this nation. Things the overwhelming majority of Americans are closely likeminded about.\nThe media outlets on the left have about used up the Trump hatred fuel.
