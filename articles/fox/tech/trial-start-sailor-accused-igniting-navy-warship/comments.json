When a ship goes into an SRA or an EDSRA the keys are essentially handed over to the shipyard at some point early in the availability.  Shipyard workers augmented by ships company do a variety of things to this end.  I was a duty section leader for a couple of ships during my career. As such internal rovers were given specific instructions on points to check in addition to the routine security checks, I am talking ships security not Engineering in port watches.  The reason was that in these yard periods numerous automatic detection systems may be tagged out, Critical through holes/stuffing tubes and doors/hatches are removed/blocked or otherwise rendered not secure. \n My initial thoughts when the fire occurred, all from actual experience, was that there was \"Hot Work\" going on and the assigned Fire watch failed to do the job properly.  Also. being that this took place on a weekend when the crew manning was duty section only meant initial response was slow and ineffective. \n Please provide a link to this major fire report you speak of. I would be happy to review and then put it in terms that may help you understand it better.",

Was it this sailor?\nIt will be interesting to see the final outcome becasue during my naval service, admittedly not in the USN, I saw first hand how senior navy officers, to protect lax Government/Navy decisions, will turn attention on the easiest targets and sadly, that target is always, or most often, seems to be junior sailors.",
