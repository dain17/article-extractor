Chrome does not play nice on MACs, slow as molasses, unlike Safrai that works as fast as lightining. My thought is either the Propeller Heads at Goolge have the coding all wrong to work with MACs, or Apple has sabotaged nearly all other browsers from doing well on MACs. Since Safari works so well on mine, it isn't the machine. I have triesd Chrome, Firefox, and Opera most recently, and they all go into near COMA mode, either barely wanting to open, or once open, not responding to tabs opening, or respondong to a site. Safari hasn't that issue.",
