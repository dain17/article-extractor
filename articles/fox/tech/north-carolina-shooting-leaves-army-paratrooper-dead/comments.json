Military instillations will have a new Soldier with family arrive for in processing on a ‚ÄúPermanent Party‚Äù duty station with a housing wait list backed up from anywheres from 12-36 months! That‚Äôs practically the entire time at that duty station. A large Division sized element like Bragg, Campbell, Stewart, Knox, Bliss, Hood, and a few others will not have sufficient on post housing for families. Want to know where not to live? Go to the local pizza shops and asked them where delivery drivers don‚Äôt like to go after dark. Guarantee you‚Äôll get the best intel of an area. Another way is to scroll through local crime reports and see where there are consistencies in criminal behaviors. Another way is to ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù through areas on the ‚ÄúHousing List‚Äù on Friday and Saturday nights. Especially near holiday weekends or when known big sporting events like playoffs or seasonal staring games are occurring. I‚Äôve done this and it works. Another problem is the military haircut mandates. No way for service members to hide their identities. It‚Äôs just too obvious. Third problem. Service members cannot carry firearms on post. Any service member or veteran traveling to and from post are targets because criminals know we are guaranteed money. I don‚Äôt go on post as much as possible because of this fact. I go where I can carry my firearms and my dollars goes with me somewhere else. The nation has changed for the worse obviously, and it will only get worse. Until the DOD changes policies service members will continue to be targeted. Recruitment and retention is already the lowest I have seen it in my lifetime. I retired from the U.S. Army and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm done! Could not and would not serve at this current day in age! It‚Äôs pointless now. There‚Äôs little left to defend, and the two running the animation in D.C. are unworthy! Straight Truth! The wokeness - inclusiveness- and current mentality is and will continue to wreck the military and keep any real patriot from joining. I‚Äôve told mine they will not be in! If they do - I write them out if my will!",
