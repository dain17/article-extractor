I grew up in the 70's and remember well sitting in the car in line to buy what little gas was available because OPEC decided to shut off the tap to the US. Democrat Jimmy Carter was President and his policies allowed us to be held hostage by the Middle East oil producing nations because he refused to allow oil production here. In 1979 Iran's government was taken over by radical Islamist's and here we are 40 years later. Gas prices up temporarily 1.4%, so what, it could be and has been much worse. Thanks to President Trump we are in a good position to weather this type of problem.",
