if we do n't give [[GPE]] everything they want , they 'll continue to do what they never stopped doing in the [[ORDINAL]] place ; enriching uranium . got ta say , [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] would have found that to be a compelling argument .
[[ORG]] : this is clearly an attempt by outside forces to cause problems for [[GPE]] economics . probably others too . please ... ummm .. squash them ?
where do you think [[PERSON]] rebels got a drone ? [[GPE]] is n't necessarily known for it 's great hi tech drone design and manufactiring indusrty . and flying military drones require extensive training and ground support operations . [[GPE]] , folks . it 's [[GPE]] behind all of this . [[GPE]] keeps " hiring " mercenary terrorist groups to do it 's bidding .
not a single report on [[ORG]] about the [[NORP]] government â€™s ongoing atrocities in [[GPE]] , but they report on this attack as if it came out of nowhere , unprovoked . why is [[ORG]] shilling for the [[NORP]] dictatorship ?
this will continue until somebody lays the hammer down on [[GPE]] .
i would not make a good politician , because every now and then i really want to unleash the full , unrestrained power of the [[GPE]] military . i ca n't of a better candidate for that than [[GPE]] .
did n't [[GPE]] say it would n't negotiate , i swear they said that [[DATE]] . really they just want to hold the world hostage and get piles of cash .
be nice to see our [[NORP]] friends be a little more proactive to protect the oil they depend on . maybe add egypt who has a large ground army that would be helpful with the [[GPE]] problem .
[[GPE]] is the leader in oil production i thought . why do we still buy oil from [[GPE]] or anywhere ?
got to be careful of trusting the [[NORP]] 's . they could easily see an opportunity to rid themselves of [[GPE]] at our expense .
going out [[DATE]] to fill up the gas tank .
the war of words ---- articles like this should be held accountable for spreading lies fake stories an exaggerations-----sue the press
this is why development of our own sources of oil is so important . we are now energy independent and do n't need any from [[LOC]] . i grew up in the [[DATE]] 's and remember well sitting in the car in line to buy what little gas was available because [[ORG]] decided to shut off the tap to the [[GPE]] . [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] was president and his policies allowed us to be held hostage by [[LOC]] oil producing nations because he refused to allow oil production here . in [[DATE]] [[GPE]] 's government was taken over by radical [[NORP]] 's and here we are [[DATE]] . gas prices up temporarily [[PERCENT]] , so what , it could be and has been much worse . thanks to president [[PERSON]] we are in a good position to weather this type of problem .
[[GPE]] is just an anagram for enemy . it ca n't be that simple can it ?
just so you people get know this is what all that [[PERSON]] money was used to buy . a [[ORG]] full of cash , direct to [[GPE]] , to buy big ticket items like drones you see here , for otherwise destitute militants .
the [[NORP]] fund [[PERSON]] which is so dangerous .
did n't we already see this movie ?
