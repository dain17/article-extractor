At one time I was proud of our country since it \"appeared\" to not be as corrupt as Mexico, Cuba and other countries. Today, however, evidence points to the fact that America is as corrupt as any of the \"most\" corrupt countries on the planet. I also thought that our educational system was superior to other countries, but no more. It is unimaginable that people voted for a guy with no credentials to run a $23,000,000,000,000 economy, was on the wrong side of every international issue, has no accomplishments after 47 years in the Senate other than enriching himself by selling influence to foreign communist countries.

This person has nothing to fear.  The great and scalloped hammerheads have pointed teeth in at least one jaw, for seizing and pulling into the mouth fishes, squid, and (in the case of the great hammerhead), rays.  They don't eat humans with their relatively small mouths per body length.\n\nThe only danger would be if the person in the raft approached the hammerhead directly and rapidly, and did not heed its performance of a warning, or agonistic display.  The shark might then inflict a wound, without removing flesh.  This was shown by a physician, David Baldridge, who noted that a boy with over a hundred and fifty stiches needed to close his wound, had no flesh removed, and wrote a scientific paper, entitled:  \"Shark attack: feeding or fighting.\"",
