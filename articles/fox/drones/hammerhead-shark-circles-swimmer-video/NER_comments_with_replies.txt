videoing it is news ... the fact that it happened is common . anytime you go in the ocean , odds are there s at least [[CARDINAL]] shark within [[QUANTITY]] of you .
if [[NORP]] were n't so fat , sharks would be better able to distinguish them from the seal and walrus
it would have been [[PERSON]] fault if the shark attacked . but the liberals are all thanking [[PERSON]] because it did nt .
sharks have good taste !
this video is only ' chilling ' if you are completely ignorant of the different behaviors of different kinds of sharks . point of fact : the shark did not attack the man . this can only be because it had no interest in doing so , which for that type of shark is typical .
he 's lucky he did n't look like the usual dinner !
with several of these videos making the headlines , i wonder if there could be a universal ‚Äú danger ‚Äù sign that drone operators could use , like rapidly fly up and down , or do figure 8s- something that would be recognizable to a subject that there is something potentially hazardous in the area or about to happen to you ...
only reasonable explanation is the swimmer is a lawyer and it 's shark mutual respect .
that guy almost died of covid ......
hammerheads are extremely unpredictable , and you never know what they are going to do , or how they will react to any particular stimulation .
at [[FAC]] , the dude gives thumbs - up to the drone . so , did he go in knowing the shark was there ?
hammerhead shark attacks on humans are extremely rare . nothing here , move on .
i always heard that the opposite was true .
since hammer heads are n't dangerous to humans , this video is n't really chilling . it does n't even look interested or curious in the swimmer .
this is why i stay on dry land . if a shark came onto my turf , we would n't be friends . so , i stay off his turf .
the sheer incompetence of [[ORG]] . " hammerhead shark lurks behind man " . it is lurking beneath the man . misspelling , incorrect words , grammatical errors , and now the shift to the left . clean your act up , [[ORG]] , or you will become just another [[ORG]] .
if you need to make an underwater repair and have no tools , a hammerhead and a sawfish can be very helpful
[[ORG]] ... shark was perusing the buffet cart ... just some old left over food
please do n't feed wildlife .
this is the best example of a demarcate it have ever seen , no idea how real life works
a hammerhead is n't going to bother you . it 's searching for ' bait fish ' between sandbars .
i stay on dry land .... ü¶à
that 's what you call a tv dinner .
it 's chilly .... the shark would be much bigger if it were warmer .
" [[PERSON]] , what is this white guy doing in my soup ? " " the backstroke . the black ones sink . "
if that had been a [[LOC]] man he might have lost a foot , the shark was looking for little fish or ray 's . black mens feet are white on the bottom and look like a fish in the water
when i was stationed in the [[GPE]] we did alot of scuba diving and there was a hammerhead shark that would come around quite often and never seemed to mind us being there . it would get curious sometimes and come closer but would nevertheless go on its way and never really bothered anyone . this article is more drama than anything .
a hammerhead shark is a fish eater and while it may pose a danger just because of it 's size a swimmer has very little to worry about . the one in the photo probably was just curious at what was floating in it 's food bowl .
if the guy had a watch on or a heart pacemaker it could have been getting the sharks attention having a keen ability to track such energy output
hammerheads do n‚Äôt usually attack people , however if that guy would ‚Äôve hit the shark with his foot or something , then the shark would ‚Äôve reacted defensively
shark was just out .... cruising for snacks .
you stooopidsssss when it 's you it 's [[PERCENT]] . [[PERSON]] appetit , fishy . lol
i 'd be sweating a lot more standing beside a rattlesnake or a moose than i would swimming with hammerheads ! ! !
hey , if you want to swim in the ocean understand what you are swimming with . if something attacks it does not matter why .
hammerheads do n't attack people .
i 've been a padi certified diver since [[DATE]] . i 've done dives from [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] . i 've never once felt in any kind of mortal danger from marine life . some are naturally inquisitive , like the banded sea snake and some shark species . sgt major fish are hilariously aggressive , but i digress . surfers and the like are sometimes mistaken for prey because of the way they look from underneath . basically , we are n't on anything 's menu down there . i 'd be much more nervous seeing a moose .
any creature will defend itself if it feels it 's in danger and often before you have time to react .
wow . thank you for the [[PERSON]] paulsen like enlightenment . i feel much more prepared for my next dive or even my mail route .
this being listed under ‚Äú science ‚Äù upon fox should tell you all you need to know about [[ORG]] .
where would you list it ? sports ? entertainment ?
stupid story . it lightly mentions that hammerhead shark attacks are rare at the end of the story . there have been [[CARDINAL]] recorded attacks in [[DATE]] and [[CARDINAL]] fatalities .
the number of attacks and fatalities from the much dreaded but extinct chainsawhead shark were much higher .
so they were keeping records about hammerhead shark attacts [[DATE]] . were they posted on line or how .
hammer head do not consider humans tasty . if you keep poking them , they 'll react - but otherwise they just swim away . more click sensationalism fake journalism .
wrong music was used .
and i just got back from [[LOC]] .
looks like fish food to me and [[DATE]] [[PERSON]]
perfect picture of proverbs 17:11 [[ORG]] . this is what is in store for liberalism very soon . when you throw elections as well as everything else this is what is awaiting you . the [[PERSON]] is about to come down on the head of the most rotten corrupt political system this country and planet have ever seen .
why not just let everyone enjoy the shark video instead of forcing an political and biblical ? ? analogy
unfortunately , liberals need pictures to go with words .
lunch
hammerheads do n't bother people , they just have a name that strikes fear .
i have dived , but have never seen a hammerhead . the mouth position of other sharks is a lot different than hammerheads , so i can imagine them taking bites out of people . hammerheads no . i did look at the video , and that shark was bigger than the swimmer . i 've read that hammerheads do n't eat people , but will attack if threatened . great drone video though . if i were the swimmer , i 'd get a copy for my own purposes .
wow , that could have been an awesome vid ...
good youtube video of [[CARDINAL]] ' long hammerheads hunting [[CARDINAL]] ' long [[ORG]] ... search for " [[WORK_OF_ART]] "
i was snorkling off of [[GPE]] and there was a black - tip swimming just below . my girlfriend at the time reached down and touched it dorsal fin . needless to say , i screamed in mask like a little girl . she laughed endlessly and retold the story for [[DATE]] .
sorry to burst your bubble [[ORG]] . [[ORG]] said he does n't like y all . so stop taking his side and turn into an unbiased news station . b r [[ORG]]
and this is an article about a hammerhead shark ? [[PERSON]] ?
i did n‚Äôt know that [[LOC]] could swim .....
as someone , who has published a textbook on sharks published over [[CARDINAL]] papers , and many of them on the behavior of sharks . who is known as " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . this person has nothing to fear . the great and scalloped hammerheads have pointed teeth in [[CARDINAL]] jaw , for seizing and pulling into the mouth fishes , squid , and ( in the case of the great hammerhead ) , rays . they do n't eat humans with their relatively small mouths per body length . the only danger would be if the person in the raft approached the hammerhead directly and rapidly , and did not heed its performance of a warning , or agonistic display . the shark might then inflict a wound , without removing flesh . this was shown by a physician , [[PERSON]] , who noted that a boy with over a hundred and fifty stiches needed to close his wound , had no flesh removed , and wrote a scientific paper , entitled : " shark attack : feeding or fighting . "
folks still pretending to be shark food when playing in the shark 's house . thumbs up . hey , i am so cool .
at least he was n't wearing his chum 's delight cologn .
man , this hammerhead was almost the nail in his coffin ...
why did they cut the video right when it was getting good ?
well , it is the ocean , after all . where sharks live . this is far more common than many realize .
he was looking to " nail " his next victim ........
the swimmer , obviously , votes for a [[NORP]] . oblivious is in their dna . the whole country should be under a state of emergency now that it will be looked upon as [[GPE]] i.e. corrupt shady government , thanks to the dems . a [[NORP]] country said that the [[GPE]] continues it ‚Äôs decline due to the sham election . at one time i was proud of our country since it " appeared " to not be as corrupt as [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and other countries . [[DATE]] , however , evidence points to the fact that [[GPE]] is as corrupt as any of the " most " corrupt countries on the planet . i also thought that our educational system was superior to other countries , but no more . it is unimaginable that people voted for a guy with no credentials to run a $ [[MONEY]] economy , was on the wrong side of every international issue , has no accomplishments after [[DATE]] in the [[ORG]] other than enriching himself by selling influence to foreign communist countries . and furthermore , people voted themselves a tax increase by voting for this guy who promised to raise their taxes . how ‚Äú intellectually challenged is that ? ? ? ‚Äú clearly , stupidity has trumped intelligence . ‚Äù
the problem is that most [[NORP]] pay no income tax . it 's the [[NORP]] middle class that pays all the taxes .
how did you get here from a video of a shark
it is a mental illness .
[[GPE]] for [[PERSON]] thinking he can backstroke through a full term with [[GPE]] circling him with ambition , hunger , and ill intent .
ha ! good one
that was [[GPE]] ‚Äôs sister a little less dirty
no , i think it was [[GPE]] . it is a hammerhead .
[[GPE]] likes hammerhead ?
sharks do serve a useful purpose , however democrats are completely worthless !
[[GPE]] post
i.e. [[LAW]] ...
do you mean , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] ? "
yes ... same thing .
staged .
i know , antifa did it .
that hammerhead has a strong resemblance to my ex - wife 's attorney .
you are in their kitchen .
whoa ......
here ‚Äôs to swimmin , with bowlegged women .
super fake video .
i ve been in the water with hammerheads a few times . they leave you alone unless you provoke them . i ve seen a couple diving instructors swim right along with them .
trump would beat that silly shark with [[CARDINAL]] hand,,,,easy peasy
hopefully it can sniff out terrorist supporting [[NORP]] and gobble them up .
" hammerhead shark attacks on humans are extremely rare .... " even so , it 's a very dangerous and aggressive shark species . i think the reason why is that humans find it hard to rationalize that with the " hammer head 's " unusually anatomy at the snout it does n't appear to be the kind of shark that fits the stereotype of an maneater like [[FAC]] , [[PERSON]] or tiger shark ! i 've seen snorkelers attempt to even swim with them as they glide slowly through the shallows as if they were not predators which , of course , they are !
odds are slim on a hammerhead attacking . " according to [[ORG]] , humans have been subject to [[CARDINAL]] documented , unprovoked attacks by hammerhead sharks within the genus [[GPE]] since [[DATE]] . no human fatalities have been recorded . "
gota like google
for backup , yes . i am born and raised in [[GPE]] . growing up surfing , diving & fishing i having seen everything from bonnetheads to great hammerheads in the water . i know from experience .
what 's the point of this video ? ? ? hammerheads never attack humans unless threatened ! ! obviously , this is not the case here ! ! ! and they never eat humans ! ! ! let the guy sunbathe , put on [[CARDINAL]] more hammerheads and let them all live a nice evening of love !
[[PERSON]] .....
oh , that 's just a [[ORG]] member in another disguise trying to scare people out of the water .
hammerheads are fairly docile . their heads are designed in such a way to search out rays below the sand . [[ORG]] looking creatures !
when you 're a hammerhead everything looks like a nailhead .
this is nothing unique . every time you swim in the ocean a shark is near , you just do nt know it . sharks do nt attack people on purpose , no matter how many movies you 've seen .
i 'd love to see the swimmer 's reaction to the video . head on a swivel , boy .
it 'd be a lot scarier is the shark was a great white , a bull or a tiger .
convenient how there just happed to be a drone handy .
he represents the [[CARDINAL]] who voted for [[ORG]] ..
i think the actual count was [[CARDINAL]] if you count the rest of the ballots from [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] btw they are still counting
what 's it going to do drive nails in him
it ‚Äôs best we never learn how many times we were nearly killed or laid .
truth .
soooo true . never refuse any quickies or anything else in that field . you ‚Äôll regret it .
[[ORG]] can swim ?
i do n't know , but her mind swims all the time in muddy waters .
i love it when i here people freak out about sharks being in the water . i hate to break this to you but they are always in the water .
not always , i had one in a boat once .
yup , that has always concerned me . but also , they live and die , attack , breed , excrete in the ocean ... i prefer to swim in cleaner water , but that 's just me .
i guess you hate sand as well , given that it 's pretty much just fish excrement .
not the land shark .
boy , what an amazing grasp of the obvious you have ! ! !
as do you .
that ‚Äôs scary
[[ORG]] . dinner .
good thing he was n't bleeding .
maybe he was n't one of those " people who menstruate " .
the guy had no idea either as the shark did a u - turn in checking him out . i remember flying into [[GPE]] flying low over [[GPE]] , or some city in the area . [[CARDINAL]] of people in the water , and just yards away from them [[CARDINAL]] of sharks . most , probably had no idea either that image will always stick with me .
i 've always told my children ... never be the furthest one out in the water .
or a slow swimmer , make sure there are always slower bait , err , i mean swimmers ....
that 's what i do ! ! make sure there 's a group out just a bit further .. first come first serve !
