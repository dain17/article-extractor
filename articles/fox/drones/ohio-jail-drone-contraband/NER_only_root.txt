so many [[NORP]] are wearing orange .
i grew up in a rural farming community . when [[PERSON]] raised chickens he put up a [[CARDINAL]] ft fence around them . when chicken hawks swooped in and took chickens , [[PERSON]] set a few [[CARDINAL]] ft posts in the middle of the pen and put wire fencing over it all . no more hawks . if you want to keep the chickens sequestered , put heavy duty fencing over them thar " chickens . " stops hawks and drones , not to mention a few helicopters .
[[DATE]] for creativity ? [[CARDINAL]] for resourcefulness ?
this inmate loves living in a gated community .
if they are smart enough to do that , and have the money to buy a drone , drugs , and a cell phone i 'm really thinking any social supports need to be eliminated . get a job sparky .
make drugs legal in prison and see how much money you can make from it . an inmate asleep with a needle is easier to deal with , is less hungry , uses less toilet paper and if he ods , you just made room for another one . if you kill prisoners , you 're somehow a bad guy . if you help the prisoners kill themselves ... it 's not your bad thing , just part of a medical epidemic .
there should be drone signal scramblers around the prison .
shocked this is just getting popular now .
i hope [[PERSON]] is learning to fly a drone to drop some big macs off to his dad in federal prison . i 'm just kidding , [[ORG]] would never set foot in the exercise yard .
since they are banning them over certain prisons , i am positive they will abide by the law .
was it a silent drone ? i can hear them things a mile away . why did n't the guards shoot it down , or at least get under it ?
put guards in gun towers with a 12 [[ORG]]
that inmate should be the center fielder for the [[ORG]] .
was that an obama phone ?
talents waisted !
and where are the [[NORP]] ? are n't they supposed to stand for something now or was that just something [[ORG]] said .
the photo did n't surprise me in the least .
when did the gov't start welfare drones ?
such a drone would have to be flown from reasonably close by the prison . if i am the warden , i put a couple of guards on lookout overs strategic terrain with orders to shoot drone pilots on sight .
and we know no one will fly over a prison because the [[ORG]] said not to .
easier for addicts to get [[PERSON]] in prison than at home now . and they deliver !
in jail they get to play all kinds of games , watch tv , free meals , free beds and if your really unlucky you 'll get a room all to your self .
plenty of jails have people just chucking contraband over the walls . this is n't new .

use a drone to drop a bomb once or twice a week then the inmates will be leery
these people are a burden on decent society .
put fencing over outdoor yards . done .
i guess penitentiaries will start needing pom - poms or anti - aircraft gun emplacements to stop these !
wonder if he got [[ORG]] prime same day delivery . on a serious note , they could have just let them drop and no one would have noticed since they just looked like the pads they were playing with .
to bad they do not use their ingenuity for the betterment of society .
right now , military grade drones are getting as small as flies , and look like a fly ... with wings flapping ... we 've not seen anything ...
why do n't prisons just use cell phone jamming devices and eliminate the use of any cell phones at all ?
[[ORG]] looking to break into a new market ?
no more outdoor recess ! we 're too nice to prisoners anyway ! put them to work breaking rocks !
chances are very good that it was either operated or directed by a local police officer/ jail guard that new when to do it . there are way too many corrupt jail guards in the system . if there was n't no drugs would get in .
the nerve of that guy having that contraband dropped in the middle of those peoples corn ( ca nt spell hole with corn or it 's censored ) game !
gee ... how much could netting cost ?
[[PERSON]] would be unimpressed with these crops of modern day prisoners .
frequency jammers and trackers . easy enough and not too costly . but i guess that sounds like having common sense
full cavity search -- all the way through ?
if [[PERSON]] had a son , he would have caught it the [[ORDINAL]] time !
[[ORG]] prime
more white nationalists ?
do n't let them outside . simple enough .
give the guards a few paintball rifles and let them have some fun .
a [[ORDINAL]] drone flew by later on and dropped off flowers for the boyfriend .
well that should buy him [[DATE]] in the slammer . nice friend he has
surprise surprise , a black inmate
sounds like the guards need to hire a few snipers to take out the drones .
[[PERSON]] 's mom is still very upset .
add a roof to open areas with video cameras facing both directions . i guess this guy gets solitary for awhile huh ?
i hear the cartels are looking for drone pilots .
better than [[NORP]] launches
simple solutions . fence box . completely fenced in including overhead . they anything that drops lands on the fenced overhead .
got ta say , pretty innovative . lol
of all the " free " time they have in the recreation area they have never noticed the cameras ? ? ?
[[ORG]] is the best . you can prime practically anything and it 'll be there lickety split .
well no outside recreation anymore , not like they deserve it .
it was [[ORG]] and thus immune from any laws of the land ... if [[NORP]] get their way .
i like when such a package drops and the inmates immediately begin fighting over it .
i 'm sure those [[ORG]] restrictions of flying drones over penitentiaries will really have a positive effect ... not
if the pilot could only have " perfected " his drop . had they just practiced a few dry runs , he 'd be token up right now .
sounds like some good target practice outside the gate for correctional officers .
need to add more jail time to his sentence
could the guy have been anymore conspicuous ? he should have just let it drop , nonchalantly wander by it , drop the orange clothing over it and go back and pick it up after a few mins .
added new air restrictions for drones irregardless of sentence , shoot the recipient and put him/ her on a pole for the crows . less paperwork , problem solved
back in [[DATE]] we had to deal with giant slingshots and potato guns tossing contraband over the prison fence line . and the occasional identical looking lock tricks ! and sadly the occasional bad staff who would sell their soul because of greed .
speaking of drones , what 's [[ORG]] up to [[DATE]] . their golden plan fall through ?
and who on the outside thinks this guy needs pot and a phone instead of rehabilitation ? !
nice plan but done wrong . should have hooked up the crowd to cover and more away from the camera to drop .
must have an [[ORG]] primo prime account !
guns next ?
problem solved . they made it illegal . and we all know how much the prisoners respect the law .
time for a chicken wire roof
since guards are not watching , they should have dropped him a walther ppk and extra magazines and a couple of grenades .
is that a phila eagles wide receiver ?
only illegal if you get caught .....
this is what happened to [[NORP]] epstein after the [[NORP]] had secrets to cover up .
so did they get charged with receiving contraband ? our new jail outside rec has covering . any jail should .
comments still allowed in non political articles for now .
poor innocent man ... he could have been obama 's son .
[[ORG]] wide receiver .
our country is doing so well that even prisoners have money to spend on recreational items . [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
well if he was smart , he would n’t be in prison .
i see a potential business op . [[PERSON]] . order and pay by phone , enter your gps location and free delivery .
do you ever wonder why the government ca n't block cell phone signals in prison ; but they can and [[ORG]] record every call and text you make ?
new rules .... automatic [[DATE]] extension of sentence and standing orders to shoot down any drones at will .
revoke outdoor privileges for all involved for a year and i believe they 'll wise up a little .
put a large net over the courtyard .
now they should have him assume the same position and drop him a small bomb that detonates on impact ..
they should just make this a drove free zone . that will work almost as well as making schools drug and gun free zones .
things were looking up for the prisoner .
even the prisoners are getting wussier . they used to take that stuff in the hard way .
liberals want them free and to vote !
cell phone jammers , maybe ? not sure what to do about the drugs though ...
i would have had it drop me in a loaded pizza at least they ca nt take that away from u.
why do n't they enclose the yard with netting ?
pennies from heaven ... lol !
liberal cities , liberal prisons .
[[DATE]] , [[ORG]] ( [[ORG]] ) added new air restrictions for drones , prohibiting them to be flown over 19 prisons . that is hilarious . if laws stopped criminals , the world would be a better place . not going to happen
the next delivery will be the munchies .
lol
think what these people could possibly accomplish if they used their minds for good instead of causing problems all the time ! ! guess we will never know , because that thought wo n't occur to them .
so are people now obeying the restriction not to fly drones over prisons ? i know people obey restrictions , do n't they . lol
but wait are nt walls supposed to stop drugs ?
this shows you lack of intelligence at its best .
i ca n't believe this made news .... don't we have more important thing to concentrate on besides a prisoner inside a prison trying to get his weed for [[DATE]] .... disgusting insane beasts ....
hard times in the hole , huh .
good to know they have top notch security at the prisons .
i am still in favor of those exploding collar gadgets . messy but effective .
go walls .
does [[PERCENT]] include the inmate population ?
now you 've done it . [[NORP]] will use this technique to drop voting ballots to all of their upstanding constituents .
impressive .
was that an [[ORG]] delivery ?
so is it worth flying the drone for a federal offense ?
why did they send the marijuana and the phone ? he was looking for a jackhammer and shovel .
well , he was ignorant enough to get there ... why would anyone think he would change .
guessing he did n't get to keep it
making rules prohibiting drone use over prisons is all well and good , but do you really think those types doing this kind of stuff care about rules ?
well ...... did he quickly get high and make a phone call ?
a wall would stop this ! ! !
ok , i may be missing something here , but if someone is willing to risk flying a drone with contraband over a prison and dropping stuff , how is a law prohibiting flying drones over the prison going to help ? ? i mean , it 's already illegal to fly one with contraband or dropping contraband into a jail so .... ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
now that 's what i call good service ! can they do the same with a pizza ? can they get it in [[TIME]] or else ?
so they spent $ [[MONEY]] to $ [[MONEY]] on a drone to drop $ [[MONEY]] worth of weed and a broken phone ? very shrewd .
guess crime was his only option since he could n't cut it in the [[ORG]] or [[ORG]] .
my guess is that this has worked before . if the drop and catch was cleaner its a small 1 [[ORDINAL]] movement on [[TIME]] of cameras . easy to miss .
how many weapons do you think have been smuggled into jails like this ?
easier than keystering
contraband in prison has been a thing since prison has been a thing . its always going to be an arms race between smuggling and counter measures . this should nt effect regulation on [[PERSON]] as a whole aymore than someone smuggling a file in a cake should cause regulations on bakeries .
give the guards back their loaded shotguns . drone hunting would be great to pass the time .
getting that devil 's lettuce dropped from the heavens ...
" so , ... [[PERSON]] .. you don ' think dey has cameras out dere in da coat yahd , does you ? "
probably an obama drone dropping off an obama phone ! ! !
yes , make a law prohibiting drones from prisons . criminals will follow that law for sure .
ca n't fault them for trying .
[[ORG]] prime is everywhere !
i did nt see any drugs or phone .
the same kind of rules to prevent drone use over a prison are the very rules he broke to get in there .
hopefully , it included a " get out of jail , never " card
this is aocs new prison reform program .
this is how [[PERSON]] will be getting her vodka and twinkies very soon .
ok , now back to the game .
unable to rehabilitate this criminal . execute with extreme prejudice .
what does it drop for conjugal visits ?
[[ORG]] drop off ?
simple solution , start deploying drones that drop little packages of [[ORG]] acid in the yard . [[CARDINAL]] or 3 of those and the inmates will learn to run from drones .
drones cause more harm than good .
" this is the [[ORDINAL]] time the [[ORG]] has placed specific flight restrictions for unmanned aircraft , or ' drones , ' over [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] facilities , " a press release from the [[ORG]] its already illegal to drop contraband into a prison . so this is really going to stop them . wow . before drones , it was sling shots , model rockets , or just driving by and throwing things over the fence .
drones are a huge technological advance from the prison wallet .
hilarious but not innovative .
well , that explains why he is in jail and not the [[ORG]] . bad hands .
free phone from the sky ! it must be an obama - miracle ! ! !
god answered his prayers . and it fell from the heavens .
no [[ORG]] tryout for him !
was it the new [[ORG]] delivery service ?
should n't they be breaking rocks with a sledge hammer instead of playing a game ?
was it an obama phone ?
soon there will be drones dropping girlfriends .
this is hilarious . but the guy was lucky the bags players did n't get mad at him .
" judge , that were n't me in that video and i do n't know where the pot and phone in my cell came from . "
the big question : why is this guy still breathing ?
" [[PERSON]] ... you sho ' nuf ' b truthin ' ! word ! dat der manna stuff from heaben b real ! "
rather seen a small missile fly out and struck him on his head .
wellllllllll ...... the crooks will follow [[ORG]] rules just like they follow all the other laws ... give me a break ....
they really like their drugs , do n't they ?
or they all can just od and die the world is overpopulated
most prisons have gps jammers now , preventing drones that use gps from entering the airspace being protected . drones that do not have gps are n't affected , but they are more difficult to fly and do not have the ability to hold position accurately . there 's a prison near me that employs the gps jammer . while flying at a local park , experienced the gps jammer when i was within 1/4 mi of the prison .
well that law will clearly stop that activity .....
so put roofs over all outdoor areas where inmates are allowed . if it ca n't be covered , do n't allow inmates in that area again . or buy drone jamming technology . problem solved .
sure hope they never have a riot at that prison because they do n't have snipers to stop the trouble makers . if they had snipers they would have shot down the drone . oh wait , it ' s ohio . never mind .
if these people would use their ingenuity for good what a beautiful place this could be and oh yeah democratless would be nice also
hmmmm ... so .. a citizen tired of paying the taxes to lock up these people could fly a drone over the prisons and drop something lethal ... then there would be an outcry to stop drone flights over prisons ! ! ! ! !
ai n't nothin' new . just a bit fancier .
you can tell this guy 's locked up because he 's a genius .
whatever happened to crushing rocks
it would be so easy to make drones not fly around a prison . why do nt they do that ?
now that 's what i call thinking outside the box .
i 'm not sure what kind of phone case protects your phone from damage after being dropped from a drone and bouncing off concrete , but if it works , it 's worth [[MONEY]] .
/s there is a simple solution , simply ban drones from being flown over prisons .
how about putting a net up over the yard ?
" ... trying to catch something that falls from the sky , which falls to the ground ... " the sky fell to the ground ?
pass drone control laws . wait ... we already have them ... and the criminals still ignore them . imagine that ? !
[[PERSON]] was controlling the drone . here 's just looking for votes .
bernout 's headed to [[GPE]] to register that guy to vote .
those guys are [[PERSON]]
there are flight restrictions in all [[PERSON]] and most of [[ORG]] because of the police state reasons .
that tears it ! the actions of these inmates is proof that trump needs to be impeached .
so then what happened ? did they get the goods from his cell and take them away ? .
we had a neighbor flying a camera equipped drone around the neighborhood and it came around our pool enclosure and backyard [[TIME]] . i told him mr. [[PERSON]] does not like drones and likes to blast them out of the air and he got the drift .
buncha [[NORP]] behind bars . no surprise there . trump 2020
do it at [[TIME]] . leave the package somewhere they can grab it in the morning .
i have no problem outlawing drones for civilian use . there should be licensing requirements .
too much coddling of prisoners . what if it were a gun ? how about we swap the picnic games for work crews ?
let me guess , an obama phone . " [[GPE]] hear me now ? "
real smooth dude . ca n't believe anyone even noticed what you were doing .
who was flying the drones with the freebies ? must have been the entire [[NORP]] field
[[PERSON]] invented drones
add [[DATE]] to his sentence .
if there ’s a way to manipulate the system liberals will find and exploit it .
quick , blame [[ORG]]
[[ORG]] prime stuff .
what 's funny is that guy thought he was being sneaky and getting away with it .
[[ORG]] ! , [[PERSON]] delivers to prisons ! better buy that stock
should 've arranged a diversion .
" prime " suspect
now we know what became of [[PERSON]] .
drug offenders should n't be incarcerated - biden
could n't catch a pop fly . yeah , non - revenue generating criminals always get convicted .
simple effective solution that should n't cost a lot ... enclose prisons under chicken wire .
this is why when you see a drone , you need to be able to shoot it down .
happy birthday [[WORK_OF_ART]] , [[PERSON]]
mebbe prisons need to install ciws .. close in weapons support .. over [[QUANTITY]] depleted uranium rounds in [[TIME]] , which will drop a drone in a heartbeat ...
if drones are outlawed , then only outlaws will have drone .
why use drones ? just get drugs and contraband to an inmate through normal channels - - the guards or hired prison workers .
he should have had it smuggled in the old fashioned way . using a guard .
we call that the big house drop .....
might be hard to prove the delivery was meant for him ...
ban bean bag toss games and all games for the prisoners .
[[PERSON]] 's [[PERSON]] wo n't drop his when it arrives at whatever prison he is destined to land in .
if these criminals would put as much effort into bettering themselves instead of gaming the system , then we 'd all be a bit better off .
[[GPE]] ... " a [[ORDINAL]] - degree felony , and the penalties are [[CARDINAL]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , or [[DATE]] in prison and a fine not to exceed $ [[MONEY]] . " extra time for him .
' illegal conveyance " for the cell phone ( or cash ) ... " is a [[ORDINAL]] - degree misdemeanor ( m-1 ) punishable by [[DATE]] in jail , a fine not to exceed $ [[MONEY]] , and court costs . "
" do you want to playcornhole " has [[CARDINAL]] meanings in jail
great security
interesting how the other inmates just sit around , like this happens all the time .
anyone see the irony in that they 're playing ' corn hole ' ?
why only prohibited on [[CARDINAL]] prisons ?
drop live ied 's on the inmates and watch the fun !
“ [[PERSON]] in the sky with diamonds ... ”
oh ... no .... the guards were not paid to look the other way ...... fire every guard on duty .
1st , stop giving prisoners ideas 2nd , start making this a major felony [[ORDINAL]] , come up with a system for shooting down those drones
that s [[GPE]] , the cuyahoga county jail is located downtown [[GPE]] .. my ex works there & she says that sorta thing happens often ..
why did n't they drop a gun ? with a gun he can get as many phones and drugs as he wants . no , wait , he 's in prison , so maybe not . no , no , wait again . he 's in prison , so he can get anything he wants .
lol , humans will always find a way .
our prison systems are a joke ... it 's time to cull the heard ... anyone that disagrees , either is a criminal , loves a criminal or is a liberal ...
easy fix for [[ORG]] - just place nylon bird mesh netting over the courtyards . lasts for [[DATE]] . cell phone and drug proof .
i did not know [[ORG]] had started drone air drops ?
he was intending to trade the items for a soap on a rope .
catch fail . they need to drop off another phone .
he should go to jail for that ! ..... oh .
next time , consider pulling the pin and dropping grenades . problem solved .
you can make all the laws you want . the trick comes in enforcing those laws . lol
in the area where he is at there is [[CARDINAL]] obstacle , and he trips over it . [[PERSON]] like hitting the only tree in the desert with your car . lol
that is awesome !
try to act a little less conspicuous next time .
another dropped pot i mean punt
shaniqua miss her man !
it was n't drugs , it was a democratic primary ballot from [[ORG]] .
just another reason why prisoners should be kept in dungeons .
what 's to stop them from dropping in guns ? the punishment for smuggling in contraband should be very harsh .
ban all outdoor activity and let the inmates know it was because of him .
too bad he wound up in jail , he could 've been a leading wide receiver with the [[GPE]] .
love those guys in the tower
in the military we had warlock a frequency jamming device to obstruct bomb detonation by remote . i wonder if that could set that up . when a drone shows up turn it on and cut the operators control to recover the drone .
should of dropped cleanup from [[GPE]] streets .
i would tack on [[DATE]] and move him to solitary .
guards have alot of cameras to watch . my guess is if he had made a clean catch would have a pretty good chance of being missed . heck for all we know it has been missed before and this is just the time he got caught .
[[PERSON]] would know better than that .
need [[TIME]] a day at hard labor , why is prison now supposed to be fun ?
another slave to the so - called " safe " weed ...
ok no more outside privileges for you
encouraging to see the convicts doing hard time for their crimes . looks more like a family picnic .
adding flight restrictions over prisons , is like adding more gun control laws to the books . only the law abiding ones will care .
why did n't the guards fire on the drone .... call it " target practice " or is that too harsh for da brothers in da joint to hear ?
clever , but not too smart .
it would be hilarious if it had been a pizza .
even better if it was a [[CARDINAL]] piece box from [[ORG]] and a sponge curl to get his fro right .
[[ORG]] is making deliveries to jails now ?
a voter registration form was also dropped from the [[ORG]] .
next they will be dropping guns .... ban drones !
next up , nets covering the yard .
[[ORDINAL]] of all ... why are prisoners playing games ? prison is punishment . they should be at work or reading / learning .
black privilege ..
let me guess ... it was n't him .
was this [[GPE]] ?
the [[NORP]] are resourceful
well at least we now know the statistic regarding rehabilitation are accurate , it does nt occur
thanks obama .
i guess this clown only looks up for drones ... not moving cameras that are mounted on the walls .
you put your contraband in a raquetball , drop it off over night into the yard and at [[ORDINAL]] light inmate go pick it up . not hard .....
a net over the exercise area -- prevents drops , it 's cheap , and has a spf of " 4 " ! !
do n't the inmates [[ORG]] there are surveillance cameras at the prison ? ? ?
wait ! they have corn hole in prison ? and here i work all day and have no time for games .
lol
automated gun turrets . problem solved .
this is why things will get harder for actual drone pilots that follow the rules .
ha - ha - ha ....
good application for a shotgun with bird shot . splash [[CARDINAL]] drone .
i guess he specifically asked for the drone to drop his goods in front of the yard camera .
so they passed a law that drones ca n't fly over a prison . is n't there already a law you ca n't drop drugs into a prison yard ? i do n't think a law helps much
they do searches after coming back in from outside ...... and that was kinda big . he 's probably walking a little funny
so much for baking a cake
