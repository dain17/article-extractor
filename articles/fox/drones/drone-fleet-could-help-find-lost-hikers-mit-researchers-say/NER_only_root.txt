a hiker really should not get lost if prepared . i hiked the [[LOC]] by myselft for [[DATE]] until i was [[DATE]] . made a 3d map of the hike , used gps and compass . informed my children of the hike and expected exit of the hike . talked to other hikers before i started to determine if taking the same route and their expected [[ORG]] and carried adequate water and small first aid kit . sounds like a lot of work , but it was n't . after [[CARDINAL]] + hikes preparation was automatic .
i think it is a great idea . would be nice if it had the ability to allow [[CARDINAL]] way communications . i was lost in co . hiking a [[CARDINAL]] k footer in [[DATE]] , i made a mistake coming down in the dark . a drone flew up to me ( [[QUANTITY]] away ) , stayed there for [[TIME]] , maybe longer and then flew off . left me in the dark lost . it would have been nice if i could have spoke to it and whoever was flying it . ( military or on auto pilot i suspect , very professional drone ) . lucky i had compass and map and eventually found my way .
better have a strong battery life . the typical [[TIME]] flight time wo n't help finding anyone .
could they possibly be used in the back rooms of the [[ORG]] and the [[ORG]] to shed light on the political dealmaking and big money ( i.e. [[ORG]] , facebook , [[PRODUCT]] , [[PERSON]] with [[ORG]] , etc . ) corruption that threatens our country ?
so this is a no brainer , no offense to [[ORG]] where amazing minds abound , but you needed research to see this is possible ?
drones ! be afraid , be very , very afraid ! !
" each drone mapped a [[QUANTITY]] area in [[CARDINAL]] five minutes " that seems awfully slow to me . that is roughly the size of my living room . [[TIME]] to map my living room ?
or another approach that could save a lot of taxpayer money ..... if you get lost , you need to find your way out .
yes it could but will most likely be used to spie on people as an invasion of privacy .
i forsee a lot of crashed drones and skinned up trees in our future .
in another theory discussed by these millennial snowflakes - they say that the use of these new portable optical devices , some call binoculars --could also be of use in spotting lost people from distances much greater than just normal eyesight ... they have applied for a [[ORG]] grant so they can study it for the rest of their lives as it might also be apart of climate change . both are good as they are never going to move from their couches to search for someone , unless they might have large supplies of pot .
somebody send [[ORG]] over to [[GPE]] so they can drone bibles over to [[GPE]] . do it now .
good idea but i would put heat sensor on them and they could then pick up the body heat of anyone that is below the forest line . there are going to be many uses in the long run for drones and soon you will be seeing them in the skies quite often i suspect . some large and some small
some of those lost hikers never should have been out there in the [[ORDINAL]] place .
actually the answer is to put a small cel phone repeater over the area with a tethered balloon or drone
i see a tremendous invasion of privacy and infringement on our [[ORDINAL]] amendment rights . every time one of these are allowed to be used for the purpose of catching criminals or gathering probable cause to search someones home or property there 's the probability they will be used illegally . a ruse for permission to use one of these can and is likely to occur . history has proven that many times .
well , duh . did we really need [[ORG]] researchers to tell us this ?
and in other news , [[ORG]] scientist predicts our sun will disappear in [[TIME]] . chance of re - appearing is good , news at [[CARDINAL]] .
i think as preventive measure the government should have large drones flying overhead that communicate with smaller drones that can tag and track everyone , this way when someone turns up missing the drones can quickly locate then or at least give the last know location combined with ground / street surveillance no one will loose direction in their life
if they want to go into the woods out without a personal location device or a handheld gps , they should just be left out there .
researchers at [[ORG]] say that a sophisticated fleet of drones could help find lost husbands by searching under dense barroom canopies on [[TIME]] when he is just trying to sneak in a beer before coming home .
how many jobs will be eliminated ?
drones are already in use in [[GPE]] to help find the lost .....
why do people intentionally go out and get lost and then expect the rest of us to pay for their rescue ?
have a large drone flying over the forest canopy , where it can receive the gps signals for accurate location , and still be close enough to communicate with the under - canopy small drones and relay the precise location of a lost person back to the large drone and then to base controllers.(the [[ORG]] . )
the drones should be equipped with devices which suck firearms up into the sky and drop them in steel blast furnaces to be remelted into plowshares .
a much cheaper way to find moronic people .
