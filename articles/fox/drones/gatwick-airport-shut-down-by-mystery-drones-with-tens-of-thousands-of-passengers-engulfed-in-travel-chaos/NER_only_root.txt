the cops in [[GPE]] are busy investigating social media and the people who say something not politically correct these cops have no time for real crimes , do nt obviously have the ability or intelligence to investigate real , national or local crimes that truly effect peoples security if it was deemed to affect [[PERSON]] and their little feelings there would bee 1000 cops on this case
oh , the irony . during [[ORG]] [[EVENT]] , the [[NORP]] people endured [[PRODUCT]] rockets . and kept calm and carried on . nowadays , [[NORP]] officials at that airport ca n't fight back against a handful of drones , and allows such toys to paralyze operations ? what happened to [[GPE]] ?
just the beginning , gon na get worse , and " just a matter of time " ...
i like how the one guy says its petty . he would n't think so if it got sucked into the engine .
excuse me , but exactly what is the [[ORG]] doing at this point ? playing snooker or darts ? or are they on training flights ? pretty amazing that there are n't military plans in place to defend major commercial airports . i know that they are leaving them flying so that the police can catch the operator , but disrupting [[CARDINAL]] travelers [[DATE]] [[DATE]] is justification for shooting the drones down .
i seem to recall that [[GPE]] , during the [[EVENT]] , had an " anti - drone " gun that would disrupt the operation of a pesky drone from the remote control or on - board guidance system . have a few shipped to [[GPE]] for just such an occasion .
surly they have [[MONEY]] gauge shotguns available but one never knows about those frogs ..
“ i ’d be fuming if my flight was suspended by something so petty . " if it flew into your planes engine it would n't be so petty , you petty snob !
so why do n't the airports have a plan in place that if a drone is not where it should be destroy the drone problem solved .
if we do n't now have the capability to electronically bring these things down , they could be used to create the kind of terror we experienced on [[CARDINAL]] .
wth are the police thinking ? one , i repeat one sniper could eliminate a drone ( s ) and there would be not errant rounds period . or shotguns if in range . they were unprepared and should not have been caught so easily . an avoidable mess . or better yet , shoot the operator .
what ca nt use a non- lethal means ? or better yet use a helicopter and shoot down ?
shooting down the drones is just impossible . we have to shut down the airport instead say the [[NORP]] authorities .
wow , with a $ [[MONEY]] drone you can shut down a airport for [[DATE]] . they did n't want to shoot it down because of stray bullets . if you shoot up in the air , the bullet falls just like hail . will not kill you or even make a dent in your car . but there are parked aircraft , they maybe a little softer than your car .
it seems to me that with the drone problem around the globe that the [[ORG]] people would have a plan in place in how to deal with them . these things are flown and controlled by radio signals , that should be easy enough to disrupt .
easy solution - remington wingmaster(r ) and a few shells - # [[MONEY]] shot should work .
drone on drone warfare as a solution ?
war of the [[PERSON]] !
and [[PERSON]] anticipated this and noooooobody is thinking this will happen again . it 's a " proof of concept " attack and it worked spectacularly . just [[CARDINAL]] more incident in a long history of incidents that show how unprepared we are and how it 's impossible to get prepared because of all the politics and personalities . standby folks , the worst is yet to come .
do n't the authorities have the means to ground the drones , by shooting or jamming them ?
maybe this will get [[GPE]] to build either new runways at other airports or a new airport in general .
all the folks who shoot sporting clays in [[GPE]] and they can not figure out how to get rid of drones ? sad .
there are such things as no - fly zones , that applies to all drones . such as some [[PERSON]] and monuments . drones are able to tell when they are in those areas and wo n't function ( with the exception of few tech savvy people who have found workarounds ) . i think for starters , the same should apply for airports . annnnndddd ..... when someone managers to get around that .... just shoot them down . it 's not rocket science .
we need technology to track drones in the air , to the controller . this is no game .
you 'd think the military could pinpoint the operator within [[TIME]] . if not why not because this is a very easy way to take down a plane
probably a couple of kids with nothing better to do . " hey let 's see if we can fly over the airport and have some fun with the big planes . " time for directional signal jamming .
for a country that puts many thousands of pounds of lead in the air every year downing pheasants , deer , and whatever else flaps , you would think this might have had a simple and straightforward conclusion ... but hey , its [[GPE]] .
invent an attack drone to kill the rogue drones
the [[NORP]] do n't seem serious about solving this problem .
frappin ' toys . nothing to get hysterical about .
that would n't happen for long in [[GPE]] . them boys would make quick work of these toys .
this is ridiculous . shoot the damn things down and open the airport . police are worried about stray bullets ? ? ? tells me they do nt have anyone with enough target practice .
these drone pilots better hope that some mafia boss was n't late for his grandsons birthday party because of this .
its radio controlled , jam the signal , and pick up the pieces .
no pity whatever for that idiodic country or it 's people ... maybe , just maybe if they were not busy with all of their cops investigating internet crimes of people who say things that are not politically correct and have these cops investigating real crimes , their crime rates including murder and acid attacks may decline
obama 's [[GPE]] pals or [[PERSON]] or the mayor [[PERSON]] 's people working their [[DATE]] jobs of destruction , anarchy and chaos on the taxpayer dime . keep voting for the trash though .
[[ORG]] . the only things missing are the ear - tags .
shotgun .
i see a market for hunter / killer drones , .. equipped with cameras , shotgun , grabbling netting , taser , etc , etc , ...
this could be a test run by terrorists , and even if not , they are sure to pay attention to another way to disrupt . drones are going to represent a national security threat . and , with something like [[NORP]] or mexican fentanyl being so deadly and easily obtained , how hard would it be for the engineer - minded to rig up the [[CARDINAL]] together ? of course this is just [[CARDINAL]] of [[CARDINAL]] of ways terrorists can bring it home to us .
drones make great targets , but sadly there are no guns in the [[GPE]] .
my guess is that this was a practice run for a future date of chaos .
“ the police have [[CARDINAL]] units out looking for the operator of that drone , and once they find them , they will bring them to justice , " [[GPE]] is testing us .......
headlines for [[ORG]] . " flying objects are alien ufo 's , not drones . "
time to build military grade attack drones .
[[DATE]] boys with their [[DATE]] - gift quad - copters ...
pathetic . shoot it down for heaven ’s sake right on .
the airport security should have a pair of drones . ram them . they wo n't see it coming if you drop down on them .
has it crossed anyone 's mind that this is a test ? basic preliminary perimeter test to monitor response capabilities , actions , and times .
if they only had shotguns in the [[GPE]] !
the dangers of not knowing where bullets would go ? ever heard of bird shot for shotguns ?
[[CARDINAL]] people have their plans disrupted but it is not terror ? ? ? what pray tell is it then ?
i believe drones are a real danger to aircraft . what i ca n't understand is the reluctance to shoot them down . surely the [[NORP]] military has ways to shoot down drones . it does n't have to be a cop with a pistol . heck an experienced bird hunter would do !
standby for the copycats .
obviously a problem when gun ownership is not allowed in a country . who , except [[PERSON]] , would try to shoot down a drone with a bullet . try using a shotgun . not as dramatic as a trick shot , but effective .
that is ridiculous they have no defence setup to counter that . using non lethal shotgun bean bags or small nets to disable the drones would work without endangering anybody .
welcome to [[GPE]] , where everything is out of control .
" bullets " ? what [[MONEY]] shot , nice spread , little danger from falling shot pellets .
this has to be lamest response in history to a national security threat . they are worried about stray bullets but they are n't worried that they have [[CARDINAL]] of people being held hostage by hostile drones . i just do n't understand how the authorities can be that stupid and i certainly do n't understand why the populace tolerates it . very strange .
these people need to get a life ! ! ! ! ! !
[[ORG]] till they fall out of the sky
yea since [[GPE]] went liberal panzi , they ca n't shoot them down like we do in the [[GPE]] i guess , either ...
long barreled goose gun and no problem .
how about calling some pheasant shooters ? if they can hit birds in flight ... ?
bureaucracies demand commoners be prepared for every contingency .... i.e. , forward thinking , even clairvoyant . but , they seem to be exempt . surely , given proper planning and forethought , a plan to rid skies of drones over airports could be hatched . bureaucracies are great with contingency plans for risks that are unlikely , even improbable because they love spending money researching illusions . given a more likely event such as a drone over an airport , it is no wonder there is no plan . it is a real risk after all .
[[NORP]] falcons - works every time .
how about asking the military to lend them a soldier with a missile launcher ?
there are eagles trained to take down drones in [[TIME]] . why not use them ?
[[ORG]] , hide , the [[PERSON]] are coming , the drones are coming
a trial run ? hate to give them ideas , but imagine doing this to shut down the runways , get the terminal filled to maximum capacity with travelers , then bomb the airport .
they do n't need to shoot at the drone with a pistol . a shotgun would destroy the drone and not have any danger of a bullet hurting someone as the shotgun pellets just rain down on you . i have bird hunted many times with someone on the opposite side of a field and the pellets will drop down on me through the trees and they are harmless . i would work unless they are higher than what i would suspect
[[CARDINAL]] drone in a landing / taking off jet engine would do a lot more than just " disrupt " passengers !
trailing banners reading : crowd fund the wall !
jam the signal
“ ' we believe this to be a deliberate act to disrupt the airport , ' [[WORK_OF_ART]] told [[ORG]] . " ya think ? ! this one is intelligent ... lol
it 's almost like the [[NORP]] prefer massive inconvenience to taking decisive action .
manchildren and their siiiy toys . grow up already , people .
drones are not the " fun toys " many people seem to think they are . they are down right dangerous .
england does n’t have any more marbles to lose . sad
typical well written story title by a grade school columnist . i started to read it because i was very anxious to see how " [[CARDINAL]] " of people were engulfed by a drone .
security folks have figured out that drones will become a terrorist weapon of choice . they clearly have n't figured out what to do about it .
sounds like a good business opportunity . start up an anti - drone ' drone squad ' . [[ORG]] the drones with [[ORG]] guns . could also use the squad to keep the birds away from runways . would be fun to do .
fly above it with a helicopter and drop a net .
[[PERSON]] . in [[GPE]] those things would have caused a disruption for [[TIME]] . bang ! bang ! now back to our regularly scheduled flights .
so no contingency for drones huh ?
why not use the same technology to take them down the way they do with submarines ? it takes a submarine to catch a submarine . it 's called an attack sub . just send out the counter attack drones .
watch “ enemy of the [[ORG]] ” , bet it ’s not really hard to find the transmitter controlling them . but then again that ’s [[GPE]] .
the drones are radio controlled devices that operate either in the [[CARDINAL]] mhz band or [[ORG]] band . all that is needed is a medium power jammer on these frequencies , the drones will lose their telemetry , and be auto directed to home in on their " base " using their own gps . then you can arrest the perps .
[[FAC]] has been taken over without a shot being fired . heathrow next ?
i watched the video and it looked like a helicopter to me .
[[GPE]] is the world model of civil service
rubber bullets might do the job . but shotgun shells should be a safe bet if you 're a decent shot .
