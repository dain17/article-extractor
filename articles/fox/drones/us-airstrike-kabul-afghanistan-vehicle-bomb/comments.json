Second, the instant they set down he completely failed to establish a secure perimeter.  They had Afghans running on to the runway after they landed (several died).  Third, because he failed to secure the perimeter and do any force protection, 13 American soldiers died and 20+ were severely wounded.  Was he relieved of command for such gross negligence?   Nope.

Funny how he was able to find and target a terrorist in a city he has zero control over and no intelligence assets. Now he was able to target a terrorist driving through a city with a car bomb. The spokesman said there were no casualities but a police official says a child was killed. You cannot fire those weapons in an urban environment without collateral damage. Obama targeted a terrorist with a drone strike while he was at a cafe and killed 17 civilians at the same time. \nFor an administration that could not figure out that you do not pull out your military until you evacuate your noncombatants and inform your allies they seem extremely efficient at finding and killing terrorists.

Trump used service members lives as a political tool because he knew he was going to lose the election.  He is a sick man.
