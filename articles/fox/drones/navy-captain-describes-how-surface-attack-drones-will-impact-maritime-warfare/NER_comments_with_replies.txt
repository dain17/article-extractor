once they deploy the [[PERSON]] army they can cut the defense budget and give us all free [[ORG]] , robot , satellite controlled from inside [[LOC]] , [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] .... sound familiar
nobody will ever top the original use of drones . to spy on naked sun bathers .
unmanned compromissed by stealth insertion teams . you can bet their are nations already working that point .
neat boat … i 'll take one . i 'll have to fish off the back since those pesky pontoon outriggers are in the way , but i 'll make do .
i 'm wondering if the capt . is unable to think and talk in complete sentences or if its the reporter not being able to write well . high probability on both .
[[ORG]] , and [[ORG]] are changing warfare . their threat to the enemy is enormous , mostly unknown , and very effective . even domestically , civilian drones ( [[ORG]] ) have politicians scared .
semper fortis ! ! !
what a novel idea , radio controlled ships . so what happens when the enemy jams the signal controlling this thing , then send out a manned ship to capture it and tow it home ? this is what happens when your " innovators " are computer games geeks !
i 'm sure they have n't thought of that yet . you should apply at [[ORG]] .
autonomous [[GPE]] . great - grandputer of [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] ships are considered [[NORP]] sovereign soil , and an attack against it is considered an act of war . how will these bots be considered ?
[[CARDINAL]] good thing ... i’m sure they wo n’t accidentally collided with other vessels .
hahah ... as a former [[ORG]] , that is messed up ... but oh , so funny and true ... no cat fights onboard .
just wait till they have fully enormous submarines ... no crew to feed ... fully nuclear ... can stay out for [[DATE]] and you never know where the icbms will ever be ... maybe [[CARDINAL]] people for maintenance .
