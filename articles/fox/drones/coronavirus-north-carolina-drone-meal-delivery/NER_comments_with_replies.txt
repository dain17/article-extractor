[[NORP]] exceptionalism on display . something gets in your way , find a way around it . this is why there are the haves and have nots ( ruling out lottery winners and inheritances ) . people with motivation will always find away . lazy slackers ( r and d ) will feed off the freebies as long as they are given out .
the drone will release the package / breakfast , once it senses you have gotten out of the shower .
[[QUANTITY]] capacity ? so it ca n't even deliver a [[QUANTITY]] of water ?
are these [[NORP]] drones ?
yes
all i hear is someone yelling ....... pull !
shoot a drone , go to jail .
not over my property ... try again
[[ORG]] [ has ] confirmed that shooting down a drone is a federal crime and cited [[ORG]] , [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] [[DATE]] , a statute that makes it a felony to damage or destroy any aircraft , manned or unmanned . it is just as illegal to shoot at a drone over your property as it is to shoot at an airplane or helicopter flying over . like i said , shoot a drone , go to jail . my company uses drones . not consumer grade drones that cost [[MONEY]] . professional equipment that costs [[CARDINAL]] . if anybody , including you , took a shot at one of my drones , you better believe i 'm pressing charges .
like i said > > > > pull ! try lightening up a little bit skippy
prove who shot it . no cameras on the drone .
they 're gon na need a lot of expensive batteries ....
zooooom ! its lunch time .
oh nice a $ [[MONEY]] [[GPE]] drone to drop food off to people hiding from [[ORG]] ! paid for by the [[NORP]] tax payer no doubt by use of tax write off ! nothing like paying [[GPE]] for [[GPE]] [[NORP]] !
need a drone to drop off your meds ?
no , your mother shares hers !
the [[GPE]] is ' over ' . drones will not save your disunited states .
and if the [[GPE]] is over the whole world goes with it , [[WORK_OF_ART]] .
i guess the fact that they do n't mention the cost of the delivery means it is significant . that would have been an interesting detail .
got a flyer in my mail . [[PERSON]] cleaning with a drone spraying shingles or tile . now that 's progress . there going to use drones to spray for mosquitoes . genius .
i love the sound of my [[PERSON]] doughnut drone early in the morning !
