ca n't watch it if there is no video !
bet i can still shoot it !
patches o'houlihan could clock that thing with a wrench , [[ORDINAL]] try .
trinity : " [[ORG]] this "
think google maven and [[ORG]] ...
i think the subliminal message is to teach progressives how to avoid legal darts , , , , ,
let ’s see if they dodge no . 4 shot 12 gauge pellets .
where is the video ?
ok . now dodge this [[PERSON]] [[PERSON]] serve ....
or my shotgun blast !
oops , did n't realize someone else just posted that .
if you can dodge a wrench , you can dodge a ball ... sorry ... couldn't resist ! ! !
i just threw up in my mouth a little bit
have you seen " slaughterbots " on you tube ... ?
how do they fly it indoors with several floors of building above you ? my dji 4 pro does n't do very well indoors with faint gps signal strength . but outdoors with [[CARDINAL]] directional sensors i 've tested the claim you can fly it into a brick wall and will halt . fortunately the claims were correct . like this device the technology is growing leaps and bounds , and i see this used for transportation and commerce down the road .
i you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball
this is interesting and all , but do n’t let this distract you from the fact that obama killed an innocent [[NORP]] civilian with a drone ...
oh yeah ? who was this innocent civilian ?
but can it dodge a 12ga ?
like a [[NORP]] dodging economics questions .
these guys ca n't throw . get someone with at least some coordination . sheesh !
looks like [[PERSON]] playing ball with his only true friend ...
please explain how i am supposed to " watch " the drone dodge when there is no video in this article .
it 's like being a [[NORP]] . you just imagine a better [[GPE]] but have no way to get there .
is it me , or is this foxnews headline fake ? i do n't see anywhere in the article to watch .
everyone of those balls were thrown short . the ball would have never hit it anyway . just look at the side view shots . it is good proof of concept , but far from a definitive test .
but can it dodge a load of # [[MONEY]] shot ?
[[CARDINAL]] step closer to the ' slaughter - bot ' .
