[[ORG]] ... keep up the good work and [[ORG]] .
[[PERSON]] , mon ami
are they not a sovereign nation ? seems that anyone with an armed drone can kill with impunity [[DATE]] .
mali government asked the [[NORP]] for help , or do n't you follow international news ? maybe you are one of the [[GPE]] supporting [[PERSON]] ?
welcome [[GPE]] to modern [[PERSON]] warfare .
sounds to me like the female defense minister of [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] , has bigger marbles than mr macaroni
way to go ! keep it up until they are eradicated .
what , i ca n't believe it . [[GPE]] grew some couilles ?
... wait until they surrender ....
so , as an " operative " in the region , i spent time learning about different drone capabilities . i am totally impressed with how accurate and precise these things can be and how many there are in the operating theater . the things the public knows about drones is nothing , non - sense . if you knew the real capabilities of these things you would lose sleep .
so , you do n't know there are [[ORG]] for sale of how these [[PERSON]] , operated by military [[QUANTITY]] away . we wo n't lose any sleep because the [[PERSON]] are on our side .
[[ORG]] are not missiles , they are bombs . they have no boost capability and just fall when released .
this is good that [[GPE]] uses remote control drones , they do n't get scared and run away .
[[ORDINAL]] words a [[NORP]] child learns are ; " i surrender " .
it would have surrendered , but it was made in the [[GPE]] .
good advertising news for [[GPE]] now they can new sell drones on the sly to anyone with money .
um , that 's a [[ORG]] drone . [[GPE]] made .
really why is it referred as a [[NORP]] reaper drone ? oh yes looked it up and you are very wrong it is not a general atomics drone and it is not [[GPE]] made .
you 're wrong , b30011 is right ..
[[GPE]] growing a pair ? !
[[GPE]] always had a pair . learn your history . now , when are [[ORG]] 's balls going to drop - oh , that 's right . [[ORG]] cut them off during a debate back in [[DATE]] .
lol ! and [[PERSON]] was never heard from again .
[[GPE]] always had a pair . they are very [[NORP]] - oriented with the use of their military . but they 'd be the only competent military on continental [[LOC]] .
you are thinking with the wrong head .
[[ORDINAL]] ever drone stroke after we ’ve been fighting [[NORP]] terrorists since [[DATE]] , thanks for showing up guys , better late than never ...
[[GPE]] has been fighting them longer . they were with us when we invoked [[LAW]] [[ORG]] treaty and so was every other [[ORG]] ally . you 're a disgrace for being so ignorant of history .
please do n't write such disgraceful comments .
he just mentioned drones , so do n't get your shorts all in a twist [[PERSON]] and yes right from the onset they sent over accordian players to entertain our troops .
why would they want to involve themselves in a war [[GPE]] has been losing for [[DATE]] ?
boredom i would guess , why did we take over from them in [[GPE]] ?
how many terrorist attacks similar to [[CARDINAL]] have happened since we began taking the fight to them ? zero . the fact you think we are losing makes you ignorant , i m sorry the education system has failed you .
there has been quite a large number of terrorist attacks in [[GPE]] , you should look around this country more and quit thinking they 've got to perpetrated by a group of unsuspecting [[NORP]] .
similar to [[CARDINAL]] ? [[CARDINAL]] all have been thwarted
[[CARDINAL]] was unique , but i still will never consider it a terrorist attack knowing who was involved and the history of the group that perpetrated it and the fact the [[GPE]] turned their back on this group following the [[NORP]] - afghan war . it was [[DATE]] time that group attacked [[ORG]] , sooner or later they would 've figured out how to do it correctly . and the fact this group came into this country with legal student visas issued by [[ORG]] , access to flight schools and advanced commercial jet training , and intelligence to what airports had less or insignificant security in place tells me that this operation had sympathetic [[GPE]] money funding and [[GPE]] assistance aiding this group .
enjoy the [[PERSON]] aid ! simple stupidity and political indiference covers all of that . look at [[GPE]] city bombing and you see it started well before that .
[[GPE]] bombing was perpetrated by [[NORP]] , it was [[NORP]] born terrorist who hate the [[GPE]] government . none of the other terrorist attacks in [[DATE]] have been [[NORP]] 's either , most have been accomplished by [[NORP]] born terrorist who are looking for their [[CARDINAL]] mins of [[ORG]] .
i never said there were n’t any other terrorist attacks , i merely pointed out the scale of the attacks have not been comparable to [[CARDINAL]] . you should try improving your reading comprehension skills before trying to sound smart trolling others .
i would say [[CARDINAL]] was less " terrorist attack " and more retaliation and an act of war towards [[GPE]] . attacks on innocent [[NORP]] like we 've seen in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and [[GPE]] are more in lined with terrorism .
[[PERSON]] .... how'd it feel to do your own fighting ?
how quickly you forget who came to our aid when we asked for it .
when ? wwi ? [[EVENT]] ?
[[CARDINAL]] . how ignorant of history are you [[NORP]] ? [[ORG]] . [[LAW]] .
a bit more recently than that , but [[NORP]] seem to forget terrorist attacks quite readily nowadays .
i still remember [[ORG]] renamed [[ORG]] when the [[NORP]] were so " helpful " after [[CARDINAL]] .
they did n't want to invade [[GPE]] with us because [[GPE]] had nothing to do with [[CARDINAL]] . they were however at our side in [[GPE]] . and renaming [[ORG]] was the height of pettiness .
think you could provide a link to whatever source you 're using for your rationale . i could find nothing related to that ever occuring .
seriously ? how old are you ? if you 're not old enough to have lived through it , do they teach nothing in schools [[DATE]] ? from [[ORG]] 's website : " [[GPE]] was the object of brutal terrorist attacks on [[DATE]] . the [[ORG]] 's [[DATE]] strategic concept had already identified terrorism as one of the risks affecting [[ORG]] ’s security . the [[ORG]] ’s response to [[CARDINAL]] , however , saw [[ORG]] engage actively in the fight against terrorism , launch its [[ORDINAL]] operations outside the [[EVENT]] area and begin a far - reaching transformation of its capabilities . moreover , it led [[ORG]] to invoke [[LAW]] for the very [[ORDINAL]] time in its history . an act of [[ORG]] on the evening of [[DATE]] , [[TIME]] after the attacks , the allies invoked the principle of [[LAW]] . then [[ORG]] secretary general lord [[PERSON]] subsequently informed the secretary - general of [[ORG]] decision . [[ORG]] – [[ORG]] ’s principal political decision - making body – agreed that if it determined that the attack was directed from abroad against [[GPE]] , it would be regarded as an action covered by [[LAW]] . on [[DATE]] , once the [[ORG]] had been briefed on the results of investigations into the [[CARDINAL]] attacks , it determined that they were regarded as an action covered by [[LAW]] . by invoking [[LAW]] , [[ORG]] members showed their [[ORG]] toward [[GPE]] and condemned , in the strongest possible way , the t
you 're referring to a [[ORG]] document where [[ORG]] collectively supported the [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] is an opportunist , and that can be referenced by the fact that during [[EVENT]] they sold [[ORG]] missiles to [[GPE]] to be used against the [[GPE]] , their [[ORG]] " ally " . i guess you were too much of a child to be informed of that little tidbit .
hey [[ORG]] , it 's about time you quit letting the goat forkers slap that beret off your noggin ' and actually do something about it . we 're tired of carrying your load ...
if [[GPE]] had n't help us during [[EVENT]] , we would still belong to the [[NORP]] .
they long since used up any goodwill those efforts might have bought them . operation overlord ring a bell ? [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] lives , not [[NORP]] livre ...
where do they store the " white flag " on that thing ?
wait ... what ? well , that 's not going to make their [[NORP]] population very happy ! ( not that those people are ever happy )
the [[NORP]] always have to learn the hard way . when [[PERSON]] was president and going after [[PERSON]] after terrorist attacks , he asked [[GPE]] if they would permit him to fly over [[GPE]] to bomb [[GPE]] . [[NORP]] response was , no we do n't want to get involved , take the long way . when [[GPE]] was getting attacked by [[NORP]] extremist , [[GPE]] jumped in with both feet to get ride of [[PERSON]] . here we are again , after many terrorist attacks , [[GPE]] waits too long again to get involved .
you 're right about them not allowing our planes ( which took off from [[GPE]] ) to fly over their airspace for that mission . but can you explain why [[PERSON]] literally pitched his tent on [[ORG]] 's lawn in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] ? why was [[PERSON]] cozying up to a terrorist with the blood of [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] on his hands ?
when field marshal keitel arrived to karlshorst on [[DATE]] to sign the instruments of [[NORP]] surrender , and noticed presence of some [[NORP]] military , he asked " why , did they defeat us , too ? "
i do remember that . [[GPE]] refused us access to their airspace when [[PERSON]] tried to kill [[PERSON]] . iirc one our planes was actually shot down , arguably because of that . do you remember when [[PERSON]] invited [[PERSON]] over to his house ? it was [[DATE]] . i still ca n't believe that [[NORP]] would vote for such a terrorist lover as [[ORG]] . why do [[NORP]] mourn the death of [[PERSON]] now ?
gee , i am a [[NORP]] and know [[CARDINAL]] of other [[NORP]] .... don't know any who ever liked [[ORG]] ... are you o.k . ?
delussion ?
what , are you nuts or something ? [[PERSON]] is far . far worse than [[PERSON]] ever thought about . how about running an actual presidential candidate next time ? maybe you 'll win an election .
trump never invited [[PERSON]] to his house . link please
you know [[ORG]] does n't allow links . just google it .
i remember when liberals , [[NORP]] and [[ORG]] said [[PERSON]] was a guarantee win .
what does that have to do with [[PERSON]] ? oh that 's right . you think killing him was wrong despite [[PERSON]] trying to do so as well .
hats off to [[GPE]] for scoring some notches on the handle .
[[GPE]] attacks in countries other than [[LOC]] . they ca n't afford to disrupt their precious imports of oil .
not disputing that remark , but [[GPE]] gets a lot of oil from their ex colonies in [[GPE]] .
do you know what percentage it is ?
" [[GPE]] ’s imports of crude oil are from a broader range of countries . the biggest are [[GPE]] ( [[PERCENT]] ) , [[GPE]] ( [[PERCENT]] ) , [[GPE]] ( [[PERCENT]] ) and [[GPE]] ( [[PERCENT]] ) , with [[CARDINAL]] more countries in the single digits . " from feb. best i could find .
thanks for the percentages info . i believe [[GPE]] used to get a much greater percentage from [[LOC]] , since [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] came on line within [[DATE]] . now they can breathe easier going into [[LOC]] , but other [[ORG]] countries are handling it for them . the one left over thing is [[GPE]] taking refugees . that 's their biggest mistake . i wo n't step foot in [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] again .
i 'm reading all the comments and am amazed at the support shown [[GPE]] , as it should be . [[PERSON]] terrorists are not the sworn enemy of [[GPE]] , i ask this : what if [[PERSON]] did the same thing to a sworn enemy of this country " ?
trump would never go up against [[PERSON]] or even [[PERSON]] . he 's the ultiimate terrorist lover .
i think you have him confused with the last president .
you do n't live in this world , do you ?
[[NORP]] terrorists are the sworn enemy of everybody .
except [[PERSON]] and company
hey [[GPE]] , welcome to the party .
in case you had n't noticed , [[GPE]] has been fighting wars all over the world since before the [[GPE]] was even a country .
the drone has the special [[NORP]] capabilities to fold its wings vertically in order to surrender .
what the [[NORP]] fighting instead of running ? ? ? ? and actually killing someone ? must be some mistake .
so what did they do ? poison their yogurt ?
impressive . did n't think the [[NORP]] had it in them anymore .
some good news , for a change .
the gbu-12 [[EVENT]] is an [[NORP]] aerial laser - guided bomb , based on the mk [[QUANTITY]] general - purpose bomb , but with the addition of a nose - mounted laser seeker and fins for guidance . these are not missiles ? ? ? inaccurate news !
welcome to [[DATE]] 's poorly educated media . i had a friend crash an airplane locally , but he was able to land it with minimal damage and survived . a woman tv newscaster went out to the crash scene to interview him . she asked him what happened . he said the flux capacitor apparently ruptured and lost power . she broadcast that throughout the area in an exclusive story , scoring a coup for her tv station .
they are not only spelled different , but , they are as different as apples and oranges . for your benefit : [[PERSON]] are propelled all the way to the target . rockets are only propelled into a trajectory and then inertia brings them to the target . bombs are not powered and use inertia to bring them all the way to the target .
this inertia guy deserves a medal for bravery then . how has he ever been able to have survived this long ? and i beg to differ " bombs are not powered and use inertia to bring them all the way to the target . " bombs do not always use this inertia guy to bring them all the way to the target . i had a uncle and my dad who served in the [[ORG]] air corps in [[EVENT]] he served on a [[PERSON]] super fortress . he said [[PERSON]] they arrived in shipments from overseas and then came to the airfield on trucks and they put them in racks in bomb bays on their airplanes . he stated then when his plane was over the target another guy whom he claimed was named [[PERSON]] took over and was used at least on his plane to deliver them on the last leg to the target . he too claims gravety survived the war and is healthy to this very day , amazing . i tend to believe him but i do n't quite grasp the part about general [[PERSON]] and the bomb shipments to his airfield on a island in [[LOC]] . on that he may be wrong or he was another general [[PERSON]] as i know he was in [[EVENT]] .
guided vice propelled
good facts that 's why i pointed it out .
you questioned the gbu-12 [[EVENT]] nomenclature ( these are not missiles ? ? ? ) . only by adding a propulsion system , which fins and laser guidance systems are not , would make it a missle
i stated this much in my original post ? i have called in more mk80 series bombs than i can remember .
your'e not the only one ...
that aircraft cost more than the gnp of mali !
so let 's see , you got a whole 7 ............ and let over a million into your country . [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] , wise up and get the hell out . it was an old colony and they do n't want you there . do n't waste another man on this baloney . let them kill themselves .
the problem with that solution is they wo nt stop at just killing each other they end up spreading out and killing anyone who disagrees with them . lobbing guided bombs at them seems to be about the only way to slow down this follow me or die stuff .
much like [[NORP]] in the [[CARDINAL]] 's , eh . at least they evolved ... … .somewhat .
i 'm assuming you'r referring to the genocidal efforts they took to wipe out the indigenous peoples of [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[LOC]] . there 's also the [[WORK_OF_ART]] , the inquisition . yeah i 'm not a fan of [[ORG]] , they really need to be tried for crimes against humanity . no they did not evolve , they just got very good at hiding their acts .
yes , but if we were to try to be tried for crimes against humanity that happened [[DATE]] , it would be safe to say that the white man should be tried for same when it comes to the [[NORP]] . it is all history . it ai n't pretty , but some things are best left alone and hopefully we learn .
yeah , but i 'm [[NORP]] so what [[PERSON]] and the [[NORP]] church did to my people is more personal than what [[NORP]] did to the rest of [[LOC]] .... yes i do realize we ca n't prosecute anyone for crimes commit by someone from the past , i 'm pretty sure the entire world would guilty of crimes against humanity . you are correct we can learn from history , but only if we do not gloss over some of the more disturbing aspects of it .
it does n't slow anything down . their ideology is what it is . whiskeybravo is correct .
a great day in mali ! 7 down and [[CARDINAL]] to go
every little bit helps .
indeed
congratulations , our friends who helped us defeat the awful [[NORP]] overlords in the revolutionary war .
and we bankrupted them , which led to [[EVENT]] . who says history is n't funny ?
[[CARDINAL]] with [[CARDINAL]] blow !
meanwhile they let a million into [[GPE]] ... … ...
actually they did n't have a choice . the dictators in [[GPE]] tell them and other [[NORP]] countries under the [[ORG]] " flag " how many a year to allow in . [[PERSON]] . the [[NORP]] were smart enough to realize what it was doing to their country . are we ?
[[NORP]] hardware killing terrorists one strike at a time . hurah .
good job , [[GPE]] !
[[NORP]] built drone shining again .
excellent news .... merry [[DATE]] everyone .
the [[NORP]] fried those mutts .
[[ORG]] , [[GPE]] ! welcome to [[DATE]] .
" ... killing [[CARDINAL]] soldiers in the deadliest military loss for [[GPE]] .... " that 's [[PERCENT]] of their entire military ! [[PERSON]] !
sounds like a good start
that thing could carry a lot of [[ORG]] packages !
if [[GPE]] wants to kill islamic extremists they should probably start at home .
let 's hope this is a trend that goes viral .
at least they kill terrorists , not funeral processions or wedding parties .
now , [[PERSON]] ... on to [[GPE]] !
oh [[GPE]] , you just made yourself some ' powerful ' enemys ... the squad will be sending nasty tweets soon !
congratulations to [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] , welcome to [[DATE]] .
why is [[GPE]] in [[GPE]] anyway ? do n't they know they 'll regret any involvement in [[LOC]] ?
mali was a [[NORP]] colony until the late 50 's early 60 's , so i 'm sure they have interests there that require protection .
notice how this story just kind of drones on and on ...
[[PERSON]] that 's cute , look who wants to play soldier !
looks like president [[PERSON]] has finally shamed [[NORP]] president [[PERSON]] into acting like a man . it 's about time !
see it 's fun ...
the geste brothers would have liked to have had one of these .
the [[NORP]] used an [[NORP]] mode drone ? ? ? ? ? ?
[[CARDINAL]] cheers for [[GPE]] . oh , it 's about time .
their drones bombed them with week old baguettes ... the result was quite terrifying as they thought it was mana from the heavens , only to choke when they tried to eat it .
" a - la - la - la - la - la------ " kroooooooooooooommmmmmmmm !
somebody tell [[PERSON]] , [[ORG]] , that some good [[NORP]] did something !
[[PERSON]] invented the nation of [[GPE]] .
nah . he 's just dyslexic . he thought the mail was here .
[[CARDINAL]] for [[CARDINAL]] . keep up the good work
at least somebody else can step up and be the world police now besides us .. glad to see [[NORP]] tax dollars being spent for once instead .
[[GPE]] would have surrendered but the [[ORG]] fighters could n't see the white flag from the drone control center [[QUANTITY]] away
[[PERSON]] !
it is ironic that the western nations say they believe in ' due process . ' yet kill people in other countries with no due process . in the past you asked a foreign gov to extridate a criminal , not violate their sovereignty by killing their citizens .
its called war .
[[ORG]] has not declared war since [[DATE]] . that 's another formality we over look .
probably time for [[GPE]] to surrender while they are ahead .
keep at it , there 's plenty more .
ahh oui oui , life is good . now let us have some wine
[[GPE]] 's drone sure does look a lot like one of ours !
notice it is an [[NORP]] built drone . for some reason [[NORP]] drones only fly in reverse .
[[NORP]] drones , when fired , diisplay a large white flag .
frances greatest military acvomplishment since waterloo ... um ... wait [[TIME]]
they have n't won since they stopped the viking from completely sacking [[GPE]] .
well [[GPE]] what took you so long to engage ?
getting the money to buy refurbished us reapers in djibouty .... wonder if [[NORP]] service / tropps run them from [[GPE]] !
hey look , [[GPE]] did something right for a change .
after each strike it says , " [[PERSON]] suis vraiment desole " ( i 'm so sorry )
why does [[GPE]] have a military anyway ? it ’s not like they are gon na fight off an invasion .
they are in a panic to protect their truffles and escargot . why i would not know .
[[GPE]] 's moto is " we surrender " ai nt it grand to have [[ORG]]
diapers everywhere !
that s ok , they just grow up to be terrorists anyway
finally , the [[NORP]] have found a way to fight without spilling their wine .
[[PERSON]]
must have been built somewhere else . [[NORP]] - built drones are programmed to surrender to the [[ORDINAL]] person they see .
just when i was about to give up all hope for [[GPE]] .
the drone , being [[LANGUAGE]] , then immediately surrendered .
has [[PERSON]] apologized for selling [[PERSON]] to the [[NORP]] yet ?
obama 's still working on his apology for selling arms to the cartels and financing [[GPE]] 's terrorism . after that he s going to work on apologizing for the reaper drones
wait [[GPE]] has armed forces !
they come complete with white flags and a baret
" i want a warhead of my own "
[[GPE]] akbar .
built flown and maintained bt someone other than [[GPE]] i bet
wait am i reading that right ... [[GPE]] ? i thought they were a safe haven for terrorist cells .
[[GPE]] has a drone ?
obama loved his drones ...
funny how it looks just like one of our drones ......... just sayin
has [[PERSON]] and [[GPE]] officially denounced [[GPE]] yet ?
did it back over them ?
welcome to the party pal ....
looks like an [[NORP]] made drone
this story makes me feel all [[ORG]] inside .
should n't they be killing the terrorists in [[GPE]] ? do a few missions in those no go zones maybe ?
for sale : used [[ORG]] carbine . never fired . dropped once .
not a fan of radical islam ... but not a fan of [[GPE]] either . this seems like another classic political stunt to divert the [[NORP]] from the riots at home .
do away with pc [[FAC]] and go for the win frenchies !
it 's a start . good job [[GPE]] .
way to go , [[GPE]] . we got plenty more of those to sell you .
it ’s a good thing it did n’t get shot at . it would have turned around and ran back to [[GPE]] .
it took an [[NORP]] made reaper drone sold to [[GPE]] to give them their successful strike against terrorists in foreign land . [[NORP]] people are always critical of any of their soldiers getting killed . [[NORP]] problems are the people who migrated to [[GPE]] who wo n't assimilate with their culture ... [[GPE]] is under siege . if they continue with their lax migration from [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] , there will be no more [[GPE]] ( as we know it ) in [[DATE]] ...
a [[ORG]] sooner than that ...
same with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and most [[ORG]] member countries ...
trump still winning ! ! ! ! [[PERSON]] ! ! ! !
[[GPE]] finally got some pay back for [[FAC]] fire .
[[FAC]] is in [[GPE]] .
[[PERSON]] says you can have a cookie mr geography .
sadly , if they want to kill terrorists , they 'll need to fly these drones over their own cities . they have allowed too many ' slims in unchecked ( as has most of [[LOC]] ) and now face major peril from within .
boy , exciting times ... soon all nations will fly these things , rich private citizens too ....... if they make them generic enough someday it will be like international death clue ! ! who did the bombing , who was the actual intended target , why were they targeted , etc ..... ? ? ? ? ? the liberals will be fondly remembering the times when " gun control " was a thing ......
i can not * wait * to get a drone like that at [[ORG]] . how did [[PRODUCT]] allow this anyway ?
if it were ever available at [[ORG]] , we would n’t have a “ liberal ” problem .
[[CARDINAL]] of the entire mali population lives past [[DATE]] , anyway - [[PERCENT]] are [[DATE]] . all the older ones in [[GPE]] migrated to [[GPE]] . nobody goes to mali to retire .
not the best time to be a terrorist ! haha
the [[NORP]] have actually had this for a number of [[DATE]] . this is just the [[ORDINAL]] time they could get it to fly toward the threat .
good job [[GPE]] . keep it up .
follow the money . likely us$ cash for [[GPE]] scam nuke deal , finding it 's way to supply [[NORP]] radicals .
i bet either [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] 's were in control of the drone . the [[NORP]] have a bad history of combat and losing wars .
excellent . wipe up more of them .
let 's see ... what 's 7 x [[DATE]] ? and can we multiply that by a factor of [[CARDINAL]] so ?
probably only flies in reverse ...
police in [[GPE]] are going to be out in force [[TIME]]
a good start , [[CARDINAL]] m jihadists to go
its about time [[GPE]] did something besides coddle islamo fascists
[[DATE]] after the [[GPE]] began using drones for surveillance and then as weapons , the [[NORP]] finally get the technology by buying the [[GPE]] made reaper . the [[NORP]] have a well developed aircraft industry that has in the past produce some of the most iconic fighters and passenger planes . you would think they could have produced a drone . but then again , the [[GPE]] military weapons systems are the most advanced in the world . [[ORG]] now has [[CARDINAL]] new [[PRODUCT]] fifth generation fighters with [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] old [[ORDINAL]] generation aircraft that are [[DATE]] that are still the best in the world . [[GPE]] has a [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter that has huge problems and is n't that stealthy . ditto [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] has reported that they have been able to track [[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] gen aircraft , so there 's that . [[LOC]] is talking about skipping the [[ORDINAL]] generation and building a [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter . brilliant idea . with no experience in producing [[ORDINAL]] gen fighters , let 's just skip ahead without the technology experience and build a [[ORDINAL]] gen fighter . that will take [[DATE]] to become operational . meanwhile , those countries buying the [[PRODUCT]] are way ahead of the game . the [[GPE]] will produce a [[ORDINAL]] gen fighter [[DATE]] before [[LOC]] . well done [[LOC]] . let your pride put you behind the [[CARDINAL]] ball .
right after the strike , the drone surrendered .
does that make this a " [[NORP]] military victory ? "
in a related story [[CARDINAL]] martyred [[NORP]] militants arrived in paradise only to find that their promised [[CARDINAL]] virgins all looked like an aroused maxine [[PERSON]] wearing only a smile
maxi does n't smile , it would ruin her image .
oh , i thought it would have been in [[GPE]] .
hey man , nice shot . glad to see the [[NORP]] doing their share . their biggest problem is they have already let too many of them crash the party there and many of its cities are [[ORDINAL]] world cesspools filled with ' slims .
it figures , [[NORP]] started fighting when none of them can be hurt otherwise they 'd just surrender to whoever fights against them .
good ... now quit allowing them into you country .
in [[DATE]] , [[GPE]] will need the drones to take their country back from the refugees .
so i take it they were trying to surrender and crashed in to the militants due to a malfunction ?
[[GPE]] is a more target rich environment for hitting [[ORG]] .
only took them [[CARDINAL]] yrs to join the fight .
[[GPE]] finally picking up the slack [[DATE]]
i 'm glad [[GPE]] finally learned how to play with remote controlled planes ..
kill 7 on another continent with a drone while your president surrenders your country to the [[CARDINAL]] he already let in . seems logical .
does the drone have the [[NORP]] white flag of surrender on it ?
hopefully a priest blessed the drone .
[[NORP]] salute ?
i would rather have a [[NORP]] battalion in front of me than a [[NORP]] platoon behind me .... sincerely , [[PERSON]]
[[NORP]] militants better eye the skies , lest they all disappear in time . allah ca n't help them . he is occupied [[CARDINAL]] finding virgins for their post - life carnal urges .
[[GPE]] earned its [[ORDINAL]] vertebrae .
they were probably trying to surrender and hit the wrong button .... dont get too excited .
" she had announced in [[DATE]] that [[GPE]] would arm its surveillance drones after the country suffered a string of extremist attacks . " liberals always have to learn it the hard way ...
and it only took [[DATE]] to get done .
i m pretty sure someone was cleaning it ... and it went off .
thought i 'd never say it but , " way to go , [[GPE]] ! "
wow . this puts [[GPE]] only [[DATE]] behind the [[GPE]] ..... what a great and valuable ally
that good value of the money !
about time the rest of the world starts doing something . would n't of happened if president [[PERSON]] did n't motivate them and get them off their behinds .
yes , we all know if it were not for [[ORG]] , no one in the world would do anything against terrorists .
impossible , they do n't exist anymore [[PERSON]] told us so .
here 's your sign .
we should use drones to kill elephant poachers in [[LOC]] .
does it broadcast " i surrender " in multiple languages ?
i have to admit heavy use of drones during the [[PERSON]] administration to kill terrorists had advanced weaponry of drones . as long as we have a defense against the tech , then its use is better than flying human pilots . i also advocate using interplanetary probes than manned flights to other planets . it 's a form of cheaper , less dangerous , and quicker exploration of other worlds although not as glamorous .
[[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] - ever armed drone strike kills [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] militants in [[PERSON]] ! ! more please ! !
hurray ! send more ...
field test a success .
[[ORDINAL]] time the [[NORP]] military put anything in the air that was n't a white flag ... good job fellas !
oof .
remember when obama killed [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] with drones without due process ? he could have / should have been impeached for that .
wow ! the [[NORP]] actually engaging bad guys instead of running away ! now that 's news ! ! !
" surprise "
ah , some good news for a change .
[[PERSON]] will blame it on [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] is going to stop supporting terrorists and start to fight them , well congratulations .
if it were a drone built by [[GPE]] , it would 've killed the terrorist by falling on them .
are the [[NORP]] drones really [[CARDINAL]] - stroke kickstart powered ... ? asking for a friend ...
it 's a pull - start
nothing wrong with a [[CARDINAL]] - stroke . [[PERSON]] was a wiz on [[CARDINAL]] .
the world needs to have a competition to see who can get the most drone kills on [[NORP]] extremists ... like an [[EVENT]] competition for militaries of the world
right on ! ! go [[GPE]] ! !
[[ORG]] is a bomb .

merci beaucoup .
was [[CARDINAL]] of them [[PERSON]] ’s brother / husband ?
go [[GPE]] ! unmanned drones ! no surrender !
they still have a long way to go if they want to catch up to the body count of [[ORG]]
his followers have no idea of the civilians obamas drones killed . [[ORG]] and the rest never report it . non partisan experts say anywhere from [[CARDINAL]] innocents . obama admits to [[CARDINAL]] ... what a joke . attempts to kill 41 men resulted in the deaths of [[CARDINAL]] people , as of [[DATE]] the [[LOC]]
meanwhile he got [[WORK_OF_ART]] , very true that the m5 m never mentions anything about this , maybe the left leaning media did n't want to tarnish his presidency , and the right leaning media has no problem with innocent [[NORP]] being droned to death .
the [[NORP]] ? this must be a misprint !
probably in defiance of [[ORG]] 's orders .
a good start ?
do it again [[DATE]] .
and [[DATE]] and [[DATE]] and the next day ad nauseum
their goat widows are sorrowfully naying .
obviously a good return on investment .
