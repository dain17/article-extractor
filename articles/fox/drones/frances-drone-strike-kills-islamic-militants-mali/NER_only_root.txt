[[ORG]] ... keep up the good work and [[ORG]] .
[[PERSON]] , mon ami
are they not a sovereign nation ? seems that anyone with an armed drone can kill with impunity [[DATE]] .
welcome [[GPE]] to modern [[PERSON]] warfare .
sounds to me like the female defense minister of [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] , has bigger marbles than mr macaroni
way to go ! keep it up until they are eradicated .
what , i ca n't believe it . [[GPE]] grew some couilles ?
so , as an " operative " in the region , i spent time learning about different drone capabilities . i am totally impressed with how accurate and precise these things can be and how many there are in the operating theater . the things the public knows about drones is nothing , non - sense . if you knew the real capabilities of these things you would lose sleep .
[[ORG]] are not missiles , they are bombs . they have no boost capability and just fall when released .
this is good that [[GPE]] uses remote control drones , they do n't get scared and run away .
[[ORDINAL]] words a [[NORP]] child learns are ; " i surrender " .
it would have surrendered , but it was made in the [[GPE]] .
good advertising news for [[GPE]] now they can new sell drones on the sly to anyone with money .
[[GPE]] growing a pair ? !
[[ORDINAL]] ever drone stroke after we ’ve been fighting [[NORP]] terrorists since [[DATE]] , thanks for showing up guys , better late than never ...
[[PERSON]] .... how'd it feel to do your own fighting ?
hey [[ORG]] , it 's about time you quit letting the goat forkers slap that beret off your noggin ' and actually do something about it . we 're tired of carrying your load ...
where do they store the " white flag " on that thing ?
wait ... what ? well , that 's not going to make their [[NORP]] population very happy ! ( not that those people are ever happy )
the [[NORP]] always have to learn the hard way . when [[PERSON]] was president and going after [[PERSON]] after terrorist attacks , he asked [[GPE]] if they would permit him to fly over [[GPE]] to bomb [[GPE]] . [[NORP]] response was , no we do n't want to get involved , take the long way . when [[GPE]] was getting attacked by [[NORP]] extremist , [[GPE]] jumped in with both feet to get ride of [[PERSON]] . here we are again , after many terrorist attacks , [[GPE]] waits too long again to get involved .
hats off to [[GPE]] for scoring some notches on the handle .
[[GPE]] attacks in countries other than [[LOC]] . they ca n't afford to disrupt their precious imports of oil .
i 'm reading all the comments and am amazed at the support shown [[GPE]] , as it should be . [[PERSON]] terrorists are not the sworn enemy of [[GPE]] , i ask this : what if [[PERSON]] did the same thing to a sworn enemy of this country " ?
hey [[GPE]] , welcome to the party .
the drone has the special [[NORP]] capabilities to fold its wings vertically in order to surrender .
what the [[NORP]] fighting instead of running ? ? ? ? and actually killing someone ? must be some mistake .
so what did they do ? poison their yogurt ?
impressive . did n't think the [[NORP]] had it in them anymore .
some good news , for a change .
the gbu-12 [[EVENT]] is an [[NORP]] aerial laser - guided bomb , based on the mk [[QUANTITY]] general - purpose bomb , but with the addition of a nose - mounted laser seeker and fins for guidance . these are not missiles ? ? ? inaccurate news !
that aircraft cost more than the gnp of mali !
so let 's see , you got a whole 7 ............ and let over a million into your country . [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] , wise up and get the hell out . it was an old colony and they do n't want you there . do n't waste another man on this baloney . let them kill themselves .
a great day in mali ! 7 down and [[CARDINAL]] to go
congratulations , our friends who helped us defeat the awful [[NORP]] overlords in the revolutionary war .
[[CARDINAL]] with [[CARDINAL]] blow !
meanwhile they let a million into [[GPE]] ... … ...
[[NORP]] hardware killing terrorists one strike at a time . hurah .
good job , [[GPE]] !
[[NORP]] built drone shining again .
excellent news .... merry [[DATE]] everyone .
the [[NORP]] fried those mutts .
[[ORG]] , [[GPE]] ! welcome to [[DATE]] .
" ... killing [[CARDINAL]] soldiers in the deadliest military loss for [[GPE]] .... " that 's [[PERCENT]] of their entire military ! [[PERSON]] !
sounds like a good start
that thing could carry a lot of [[ORG]] packages !
if [[GPE]] wants to kill islamic extremists they should probably start at home .
let 's hope this is a trend that goes viral .
at least they kill terrorists , not funeral processions or wedding parties .
now , [[PERSON]] ... on to [[GPE]] !
oh [[GPE]] , you just made yourself some ' powerful ' enemys ... the squad will be sending nasty tweets soon !
congratulations to [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] , welcome to [[DATE]] .
why is [[GPE]] in [[GPE]] anyway ? do n't they know they 'll regret any involvement in [[LOC]] ?
notice how this story just kind of drones on and on ...
[[PERSON]] that 's cute , look who wants to play soldier !
looks like president [[PERSON]] has finally shamed [[NORP]] president [[PERSON]] into acting like a man . it 's about time !
see it 's fun ...
the geste brothers would have liked to have had one of these .
the [[NORP]] used an [[NORP]] mode drone ? ? ? ? ? ?
[[CARDINAL]] cheers for [[GPE]] . oh , it 's about time .
their drones bombed them with week old baguettes ... the result was quite terrifying as they thought it was mana from the heavens , only to choke when they tried to eat it .
" a - la - la - la - la - la------ " kroooooooooooooommmmmmmmm !
somebody tell [[PERSON]] , [[ORG]] , that some good [[NORP]] did something !
[[PERSON]] invented the nation of [[GPE]] .
[[CARDINAL]] for [[CARDINAL]] . keep up the good work
at least somebody else can step up and be the world police now besides us .. glad to see [[NORP]] tax dollars being spent for once instead .
[[GPE]] would have surrendered but the [[ORG]] fighters could n't see the white flag from the drone control center [[QUANTITY]] away
[[PERSON]] !
it is ironic that the western nations say they believe in ' due process . ' yet kill people in other countries with no due process . in the past you asked a foreign gov to extridate a criminal , not violate their sovereignty by killing their citizens .
probably time for [[GPE]] to surrender while they are ahead .
keep at it , there 's plenty more .
ahh oui oui , life is good . now let us have some wine
[[GPE]] 's drone sure does look a lot like one of ours !
notice it is an [[NORP]] built drone . for some reason [[NORP]] drones only fly in reverse .
frances greatest military acvomplishment since waterloo ... um ... wait [[TIME]]
well [[GPE]] what took you so long to engage ?
hey look , [[GPE]] did something right for a change .
after each strike it says , " [[PERSON]] suis vraiment desole " ( i 'm so sorry )
why does [[GPE]] have a military anyway ? it ’s not like they are gon na fight off an invasion .
diapers everywhere !
finally , the [[NORP]] have found a way to fight without spilling their wine .
[[PERSON]]
must have been built somewhere else . [[NORP]] - built drones are programmed to surrender to the [[ORDINAL]] person they see .
just when i was about to give up all hope for [[GPE]] .
the drone , being [[LANGUAGE]] , then immediately surrendered .
has [[PERSON]] apologized for selling [[PERSON]] to the [[NORP]] yet ?
wait [[GPE]] has armed forces !
" i want a warhead of my own "
[[GPE]] akbar .
built flown and maintained bt someone other than [[GPE]] i bet
wait am i reading that right ... [[GPE]] ? i thought they were a safe haven for terrorist cells .
[[GPE]] has a drone ?
obama loved his drones ...
funny how it looks just like one of our drones ......... just sayin
has [[PERSON]] and [[GPE]] officially denounced [[GPE]] yet ?
did it back over them ?
welcome to the party pal ....
looks like an [[NORP]] made drone
this story makes me feel all [[ORG]] inside .
should n't they be killing the terrorists in [[GPE]] ? do a few missions in those no go zones maybe ?
for sale : used [[ORG]] carbine . never fired . dropped once .
not a fan of radical islam ... but not a fan of [[GPE]] either . this seems like another classic political stunt to divert the [[NORP]] from the riots at home .
do away with pc [[FAC]] and go for the win frenchies !
it 's a start . good job [[GPE]] .
way to go , [[GPE]] . we got plenty more of those to sell you .
it ’s a good thing it did n’t get shot at . it would have turned around and ran back to [[GPE]] .
it took an [[NORP]] made reaper drone sold to [[GPE]] to give them their successful strike against terrorists in foreign land . [[NORP]] people are always critical of any of their soldiers getting killed . [[NORP]] problems are the people who migrated to [[GPE]] who wo n't assimilate with their culture ... [[GPE]] is under siege . if they continue with their lax migration from [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] , there will be no more [[GPE]] ( as we know it ) in [[DATE]] ...
trump still winning ! ! ! ! [[PERSON]] ! ! ! !
[[GPE]] finally got some pay back for [[FAC]] fire .
sadly , if they want to kill terrorists , they 'll need to fly these drones over their own cities . they have allowed too many ' slims in unchecked ( as has most of [[LOC]] ) and now face major peril from within .
boy , exciting times ... soon all nations will fly these things , rich private citizens too ....... if they make them generic enough someday it will be like international death clue ! ! who did the bombing , who was the actual intended target , why were they targeted , etc ..... ? ? ? ? ? the liberals will be fondly remembering the times when " gun control " was a thing ......
i can not * wait * to get a drone like that at [[ORG]] . how did [[PRODUCT]] allow this anyway ?
[[CARDINAL]] of the entire mali population lives past [[DATE]] , anyway - [[PERCENT]] are [[DATE]] . all the older ones in [[GPE]] migrated to [[GPE]] . nobody goes to mali to retire .
not the best time to be a terrorist ! haha
the [[NORP]] have actually had this for a number of [[DATE]] . this is just the [[ORDINAL]] time they could get it to fly toward the threat .
good job [[GPE]] . keep it up .
follow the money . likely us$ cash for [[GPE]] scam nuke deal , finding it 's way to supply [[NORP]] radicals .
i bet either [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] 's were in control of the drone . the [[NORP]] have a bad history of combat and losing wars .
excellent . wipe up more of them .
let 's see ... what 's 7 x [[DATE]] ? and can we multiply that by a factor of [[CARDINAL]] so ?
probably only flies in reverse ...
police in [[GPE]] are going to be out in force [[TIME]]
a good start , [[CARDINAL]] m jihadists to go
its about time [[GPE]] did something besides coddle islamo fascists
[[DATE]] after the [[GPE]] began using drones for surveillance and then as weapons , the [[NORP]] finally get the technology by buying the [[GPE]] made reaper . the [[NORP]] have a well developed aircraft industry that has in the past produce some of the most iconic fighters and passenger planes . you would think they could have produced a drone . but then again , the [[GPE]] military weapons systems are the most advanced in the world . [[ORG]] now has [[CARDINAL]] new [[PRODUCT]] fifth generation fighters with [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] old [[ORDINAL]] generation aircraft that are [[DATE]] that are still the best in the world . [[GPE]] has a [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter that has huge problems and is n't that stealthy . ditto [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] has reported that they have been able to track [[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] gen aircraft , so there 's that . [[LOC]] is talking about skipping the [[ORDINAL]] generation and building a [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter . brilliant idea . with no experience in producing [[ORDINAL]] gen fighters , let 's just skip ahead without the technology experience and build a [[ORDINAL]] gen fighter . that will take [[DATE]] to become operational . meanwhile , those countries buying the [[PRODUCT]] are way ahead of the game . the [[GPE]] will produce a [[ORDINAL]] gen fighter [[DATE]] before [[LOC]] . well done [[LOC]] . let your pride put you behind the [[CARDINAL]] ball .
right after the strike , the drone surrendered .
does that make this a " [[NORP]] military victory ? "
in a related story [[CARDINAL]] martyred [[NORP]] militants arrived in paradise only to find that their promised [[CARDINAL]] virgins all looked like an aroused maxine [[PERSON]] wearing only a smile
oh , i thought it would have been in [[GPE]] .
hey man , nice shot . glad to see the [[NORP]] doing their share . their biggest problem is they have already let too many of them crash the party there and many of its cities are [[ORDINAL]] world cesspools filled with ' slims .
it figures , [[NORP]] started fighting when none of them can be hurt otherwise they 'd just surrender to whoever fights against them .
good ... now quit allowing them into you country .
in [[DATE]] , [[GPE]] will need the drones to take their country back from the refugees .
so i take it they were trying to surrender and crashed in to the militants due to a malfunction ?
[[GPE]] is a more target rich environment for hitting [[ORG]] .
only took them [[CARDINAL]] yrs to join the fight .
[[GPE]] finally picking up the slack [[DATE]]
i 'm glad [[GPE]] finally learned how to play with remote controlled planes ..
kill 7 on another continent with a drone while your president surrenders your country to the [[CARDINAL]] he already let in . seems logical .
does the drone have the [[NORP]] white flag of surrender on it ?
hopefully a priest blessed the drone .
[[NORP]] salute ?
i would rather have a [[NORP]] battalion in front of me than a [[NORP]] platoon behind me .... sincerely , [[PERSON]]
[[NORP]] militants better eye the skies , lest they all disappear in time . allah ca n't help them . he is occupied [[CARDINAL]] finding virgins for their post - life carnal urges .
[[GPE]] earned its [[ORDINAL]] vertebrae .
" she had announced in [[DATE]] that [[GPE]] would arm its surveillance drones after the country suffered a string of extremist attacks . " liberals always have to learn it the hard way ...
i m pretty sure someone was cleaning it ... and it went off .
thought i 'd never say it but , " way to go , [[GPE]] ! "
wow . this puts [[GPE]] only [[DATE]] behind the [[GPE]] ..... what a great and valuable ally
that good value of the money !
about time the rest of the world starts doing something . would n't of happened if president [[PERSON]] did n't motivate them and get them off their behinds .
impossible , they do n't exist anymore [[PERSON]] told us so .
we should use drones to kill elephant poachers in [[LOC]] .
does it broadcast " i surrender " in multiple languages ?
i have to admit heavy use of drones during the [[PERSON]] administration to kill terrorists had advanced weaponry of drones . as long as we have a defense against the tech , then its use is better than flying human pilots . i also advocate using interplanetary probes than manned flights to other planets . it 's a form of cheaper , less dangerous , and quicker exploration of other worlds although not as glamorous .
[[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] - ever armed drone strike kills [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] militants in [[PERSON]] ! ! more please ! !
hurray ! send more ...
field test a success .
[[ORDINAL]] time the [[NORP]] military put anything in the air that was n't a white flag ... good job fellas !
remember when obama killed [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] with drones without due process ? he could have / should have been impeached for that .
wow ! the [[NORP]] actually engaging bad guys instead of running away ! now that 's news ! ! !
" surprise "
ah , some good news for a change .
[[PERSON]] will blame it on [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] is going to stop supporting terrorists and start to fight them , well congratulations .
if it were a drone built by [[GPE]] , it would 've killed the terrorist by falling on them .
are the [[NORP]] drones really [[CARDINAL]] - stroke kickstart powered ... ? asking for a friend ...
the world needs to have a competition to see who can get the most drone kills on [[NORP]] extremists ... like an [[EVENT]] competition for militaries of the world
right on ! ! go [[GPE]] ! !
[[ORG]] is a bomb .
[[ORG]] !
use them in [[GPE]] !
ibrahim : * slaps ousmane in the head * you had to open your big mouth ! ousmane : what ? ibrahim : * slaps ousmane in the head * you had to go on facebook and say , " pont l’eveque smells like cul ! " [[WORK_OF_ART]] journalists , nothing . mowing down [[WORK_OF_ART]] ! ! with_a_truck , nothing . we were recruiting their own children for our work , for the love of allah ( peace be upon him ) , and nothing ! ! ! ibrahim : * slaps ousmane in the head * but you , * slaps ousmane in the head * had to go and tweet , " bordeaux wines will never be better than [[GPE]] wines " ? idiot ! * slaps the shiznit out of ousmane *
merci beaucoup .
was [[CARDINAL]] of them [[PERSON]] ’s brother / husband ?
go [[GPE]] ! unmanned drones ! no surrender !
they still have a long way to go if they want to catch up to the body count of [[ORG]]
the [[NORP]] ? this must be a misprint !
probably in defiance of [[ORG]] 's orders .
a good start ?
do it again [[DATE]] .
their goat widows are sorrowfully naying .
obviously a good return on investment .
