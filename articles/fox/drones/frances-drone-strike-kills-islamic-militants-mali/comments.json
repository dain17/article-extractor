You would think they could have produced a drone.\n\nBut then again, the US military weapons systems are the most advanced in the world.\n\nThe Air Force now has over 400 new F-35 fifth generation fighters with 180 F-22 old fifth generation aircraft that are about 20 years old that are still the best in the world.\n\nRussia has a fifth generation fighter that has huge problems and isn't that stealthy.  Ditto China.  India has reported that they have been able to track China's fifth gen aircraft, so there's that.\n\nEurope is talking about skipping the fifth generation and building a sixth generation fighter.  Brilliant idea.  With no experience in producing fifth gen fighters, let's just skip ahead without the technology experience and build a sixth gen fighter.  That will take about 20 years to become operational.\n\nMeanwhile, those countries buying the F-35 are way ahead of the game.\n\nThe US will produce a sixth gen fighter a decade before Europe.\n\nWell done Europe.

He said Generalee they arrived in shipments from overseas and then  came to the airfield on trucks and they put them in racks in bomb bays on their airplanes. He stated then when his plane was over the target another guy whom he claimed was named Gravety took over and was used at least on his plane to deliver them on the last leg to the target. He too claims Gravety survived the war and is healthy to this very day, amazing.\nI tend to believe him but I don't quite grasp the part about General Lee and the bomb shipments to his airfield on a island in the south pacific.
