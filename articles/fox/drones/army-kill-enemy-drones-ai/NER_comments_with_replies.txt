i 've read the examples of real conversations . the cyber criminals do n't use indef articles . this means they are most likely [[LANGUAGE]] or [[LANGUAGE]] . they sound especially stupid , and honestly , i give more credit to the [[NORP]] . the convos definitely sound either [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] . [[NORP]] are another possibility , but they too are not this stupid . research it online and you will see what i mean .
q : well , i 'll hazard i can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of [[PERSON]] than you can do in a year in the field . [[PERSON]] : oh , so why do you need me ? q : every now and then a trigger has to be pulled . [[PERSON]] : or not pulled . it 's hard to know which in your pajamas .
hey [[PERSON]] why do n't you just hand [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] ........ the complete manual with the instruction book .
we really should n't be publishing this stuff . all admins seem to do it , and i got ta wonder if it is deliberate . leading foreign govts down the wrong trail ... imo .
i hope this is true ... but , it could be propaganda to slow down the proliferation of drones in rogue states , and illegal activities ...
both .
artificial intelligence ... is n't that what you get when a blonde dies her hair brown ?
i m going to be killed by a robot
it will still be considered [[PERSON]] . betcha .
just talking with a friend [[DATE]] who has a relative working for raytheon . sounds like some pretty amazing things going on with this work . would be great if we can keep everybody and his [[NORP]] brother from scooping it up .
