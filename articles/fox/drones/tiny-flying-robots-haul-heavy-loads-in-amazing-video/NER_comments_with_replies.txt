it still has a ways to go in order to open door handles but it wo n't be long !
take a look at [[ORG]] and atlas from [[ORG]] .
i was just going to say that . very cool tech .
i want [[CARDINAL]] :)
you always see the big headlines about the " doom and gloom " potential of technology , but there is a ton of upside .
very cool ! i love technology .
as long as they can deliver packages and assassinate people ... that 's what counts .
" package " is a military code for " bomb " so it works both ways .
the ham bone is in the squeak box , [[ORG]] . red team , go !
assimilate ...... now !
dark ....
god 's creation always seem to be the inspiration for some of the greatest break troughs in science .
no such thing as god . why such a post on a science topic ? keep your silly ideas to yourself .
way to be tolerant .
tolerance is not the issue . thinking that imaginary things are real has done real harm to society in general and people individually .
what are " break troughs " ?
it 's kinda like drop troughs .... only different .
but broken .
[[PERSON]] . i saw a sign in front of a dry cleaners like that . it said , " drop your pants here " . i went inside and did and for some reason people were freaking out ! ! go figure ....
" tiny flying robots " eh ? most people just call them drones .
[[ORG]] ! a flying robot that can bring me a beer !
i hacked my roomba os to do the same thing ! ! ! ( i really did n't but would n't that be cool ? )
my [[DATE]] grand nephew actually rides it around - that 's power !
my roomba has turned into a mime ; sits in the middle of the room bouncing off walls that are n't there . ; (
lol . wow , that was a good one . still laughing . sorry for your loss . :-)
bummer . sorry ...
it does n't actually " lift " [[CARDINAL]] times it 's weight ( at least not in the way you think ) . i just uses a pulley system . hardly anything new except drones are involved .
wait till [[CARDINAL]] of micro bots armed with scalpels descend on our cities by the [[CARDINAL]] oh wait : [[PERSON]] " micro " good read
little poison darts would be better .
