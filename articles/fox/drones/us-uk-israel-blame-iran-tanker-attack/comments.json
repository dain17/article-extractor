See Matthew 24, 2 Timothy 3:!-5, Daniel and Revelation for descriptions of the mindset of man, physical signs, political positions of the one world government forming, religion and economic system. It's called globalism, Chrislam and the Great Reset. Israel will be the centerpiece of the seven year Tribulation - why? Because for the AntiChrist to win, he needs Israel's to believe he is the promised Messiah. When they realize he's not 3 1/2 years in, then hell is unleashed. When this man demands worship as \"God\" and defiles their Temple, inhabitants in Jerusalem had better run and not stop till they get to Petra.\nThe Bible has outlined this time period very clearly. We ARE in the last minutes of the Age of Grace. Once Jesus collects His people... The one who will sign am existing peace deal with Israel and others, after this battle is the AntiChrist.  God has warned man - are you listening? Wake up! Repent, be saved, seek the Lord and forgiveness - it's all happening now. Time is almost up, Wake up!  Evil does not win, God does.

Why is the US in the business of subsidizing billionaires, and helping them to evade taxes and to evade labor laws and exporting jobs to third world countries?\n\nThis is a Liberian flagged tanker.  That Israeli billionaire deliberately made his ship a Liberian ship to avoid taxes in countries like Israel, Japan, the UK, and the US.   The Liberians are also very accommodating to help him get rid of expenses caused by First World regulations on things like insurance and labor laws.  So fine.  Now that the guy jumped ship on all those First World expenses, why is the US spending millions and millions to provide private security for free to the guy?  \n\nSeriously, if anybody writing in this forum dodged their taxes in the US, would the US send an aircraft carrier task force to take care of business for you for free?   Heck, no!  \n\nIf Israel wants to put out their public money to support an Israeli billionaire who deliberately structured his business outside Israel, fine, let them do that on their nickel.  Same with the UK and Japan.  They have plenty of billions.  Why is the US taking on their responsibilities?  \n\nTo add insult to injury, the US isn't even bothering to tell American taxpayers, the sheeple who are paying for all this, what the evidence is that irrefutably proves this is Iran.",
