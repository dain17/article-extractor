keep america strong . vote mega [[DATE]] or deal with our politicians selling out . [[GPE]] , clinton , kerry . when you make america 1st . history deletes the worst . trump is proof that god loves [[GPE]]
any drone that uses your phone / tablet for video or control is potentially a security threat . existing drones that use their own controller with built in display ( like [[ORG]] and q500 ) and are never connected to the world outside via cell or external wifi are much less of a security risk . however , with the [[ORG]] 's proposed new rules , all new drones will be required to be continually connected to the outside world via cell or wifi . the problem will get worse .
everything on [[NORP]] drones are safely usable except the radio and control unit . should not be that hard to make those components here .
they 're still going to have to use parts made in [[LOC]] unless they want use up taxpayers money faster than they can print it !
thanks wingnut
[[ORG]] made a good quality drone . i have [[CARDINAL]] of them . however , their price was a huge factor , especially for hobbyists who could not write off the cost of them on their tax returns . $ [[MONEY]] is probably the limit for most people . now with the advancements developed by dji such as obstacle avoidance and a compact size there 's little chance that the [[GPE]] can be a serious player again in this field without a ton of investment money and a huge breakthrough in areas such as flight duration .
seems like the day late and dollar short story . so we start from scratch and build a whole new fleet of drones to compete with other countries who already have the best most modern top of the line technology . how long will that take , and can we even get parts that are n't made in [[GPE]] ? frankly i 'm guessing that [[GPE]] could really do a lot harm just by using something as simple as the cellphone 's we all have in our pockets , if [[GPE]] really wanted or intended to do harm . > no where in my comment did i say we 're better off buying products from [[GPE]] or any other country . what i said was " can we even get parts that are n't made in [[GPE]] " ....
[[ORG]] here in [[GPE]] make the best [[ORG]] .
your right - it is much better to buy cheap stuff from [[GPE]] and make nothing at all in the [[GPE]] . become a nation of coffee servers ( working in the so - called " service industry " )
[[GPE]] and [[LOC]] have already invaded and taken over , why worry about [[GPE]] ?
wank - thinking
we 've allowed ourselves to be conned for [[DATE]] , if you go back to the [[PERSON]] starting point - by ignoring [[GPE]] 's true nature . the dark fact is that [[GPE]] is not just an economic competitor , they are an outright enemy , based on their die - hard communism . they have infiltrated this country far too deeply , and every single thing we buy from [[GPE]] is another missile , ship , submarine and bullet in their arsenal . time to close the party down .
while i absolutely agree the way they run their country internally is pretty horrifying , there is also the reality that we 're basically talking about a country of worker slaves being ran by an oligarchy of capitalists . on the international stage they are rouge capitalists . there is no real governing authority so who 's going to stop them ? even the [[ORG]] lacks teeth unless someone gives them some .
you know who is stopping them
he 's at least taking on the challenge . the results remain to be seen .
that is a smart move after the [[LOC]] espionage scandal ! but it comes very late in the game , all military equipment need to be done in the [[GPE]] with [[PERCENT]] [[GPE]] parts , end of discussion !
[[PERSON]] has their [[EVENT]] available for commercial , military , industrial , and law enforcement use . i would like to see them increase production and lower production costs , to make them available to recreational hobbyists and part [[CARDINAL]] license holders . perhaps [[CARDINAL]] way of helping this defense contractor move into the civilian markets , would be to offer a significant subsidy for each drone produced , so that they can be affordable to the average consumer .
indago is way too expensive for the everyday amateur . try some [[NORP]] drones , they are more affordable
yes , the indago is definitely a high - cost item . [[ORG]] is a good product , designed in [[GPE]] . yet it is manufactured in [[GPE]] , as are the rest of the consumer drones except for the skydio 2 , which still has some foreign components . i think we have a ways to go , but i would n't say it 's impossible to once again , become competitive in the electronics field .
[[DATE]] of policy has been at the expense of [[NORP]] workers as dollars are concentrated in fewer and fewer hands . [[NORP]] have been drawn to cheap products that corporations have put in front of them thanks to a global supply chain . executives have absolutely done great during this time and wealth concentration is clear evidence . leveling a playing field after [[DATE]] of alteration will take [[DATE]] - are [[NORP]] willing to focus on the long run or will a shiny distraction shift their attention to the next fad ? good luck - patience , education , and critical thinking need to be encouraged .
building our own drones is not difficult . you can still use parts from [[GPE]] . the problem is related to firmware . the programming code that instructs the microprocessors in the drones what to do with the data it collects . that is all it is . drones can be built pretty easily that can rival dji drones with better secured firmware .
any electronic part made in [[GPE]] can an undisclosed a backdoor . just look at [[GPE]] espionage scandal ! no , it has to be [[PERCENT]] [[GPE]] made
you can use your chinese " parts " we will use [[NORP]] parts .
i m sure they already stole all our technology by now . obama let china take what they wanted they steal steal copy steal
you are obviously not in the electronics industry ! there simply are no longer [[GPE]] manufacturers for common electronic components . they might have a [[GPE]] name on the company , but they are not made here anymore ... made in [[GPE]] , or some other pacific rim location . even simple things like resistors .... i agree , it is the firmware built into some of the digital parts , and possibly hidden tiny devices that record data clandestinely , that are the problem here .
too little too late . the [[GPE]] military , law enforcement , border patrol , etc have a much bigger problem than drones . these agencies have been buying and using [[NORP]] networking elements for [[DATE]] . the devices are embedded in the most sensitive locations throughout our government . now , all of a sudden , there is a sense of urgency about drone . nonsense , look at all of your routers and switches with the govnerments networks that have [[NORP]] sniffing components embedded in them . you got bigger problems than drones .
i hardly think dji practices predatory pricing : i paid [[MONEY]] for the unit i purchased [[DATE]] . it works very well , easy to operate , and takes great video . if the [[NORP]] want gps coordinates for critical infrastructure , they can use google maps or take anything with a gps receiver , drive around , and record coordinates on paper . a drone is overkill . the real problem is that we outsourced all our manufacturing to [[GPE]] . you can fill up a device with [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , [[GPE]] , you - name - it parts and devices and it 's still sourced from [[GPE]] . not only does [[GPE]] possess manufacturing capability , it also possesses the intellectual property used to make the parts . they also have a lot of smart people able to reverse - engineer the designs and modify them as they wish and we pretty much gave the store away filling up our universities with full - fare paying [[NORP]] students . i 'd hate to know what they say about us when we 're not listening ( [[LANGUAGE]] for " suckers " ? ) . while kids in other countries are expected to learn math , science , and appreciation of their culture ( warts and all ) , we spend billions teaching them junk science , feelings , and that they should despise their heritage . drones are the least of our worries - it 's picking at nits .
how many [[NORP]] - made “ drones ” have been sold in the [[GPE]] ? maybe [[CARDINAL]] , used by people like me and others who enjoy radio - controlled models of cars , airplanes , etc . most of us have [[CARDINAL]] , so that reduces the actual number being used at any given time . the much , much larger number of [[NORP]] - made devices that can ( and do ) collect data is truly scary if you think about it ... just about everything that is considered a “ smart ” device , from our cell phones , laptops , pc ’s , and things like [[ORG]] ’s “ [[ORG]] ” and [[ORG]] ’s “ [[WORK_OF_ART]] ” and even “ ring ” type doorbell cameras is made in [[GPE]] . you can bet everything you use them for is being recorded by something and/or somebody over in [[GPE]] . think about it - they have [[CARDINAL]] bazillion people over there with not much to do . of course they ’re watching us ! they know when we go to work and come home , they know what we buy from the grocery store , and yes , they know when we ’re playing “ hide the salami ” in our bedrooms , and they ’re probably laughing at us as they watch . it ’s just a matter of time before they attack . they ’re just waiting for the perfect time .
now address all the tech companies using foreign technicians . we have more foreigners running our tech in big corporations than [[GPE]] citizens . where do their loyalties lie ?
[[GPE]] can only hope that [[ORG]] is reelected so he can continue his [[GPE]] policies . otherwise [[GPE]] is going to have a civil war and will find itself fighting [[NORP]] troops on [[GPE]] soil . possibly [[NORP]] troops on ny soil . cartel troops in [[GPE]] . wake up people as the [[ORG]] is stealing your country .
ah , fear is big in this one . well , drama for sure .
and they will have been invited in to ny and [[GPE]] by [[NORP]] governors .
[[PERSON]] drones .
[[PERSON]] was promoting [[GPE]] goods in an effort to help [[PERSON]] . and now we are paying the price .
hate to say it but even if the government does not use dji they still have plenty of info from everyday users of restricted areas .
trump 2020 .
yep obama and his husband [[PERSON]] always hated this country he wanted [[GPE]] to have this technology just like he wanted [[GPE]] to have our [[MONEY]] drone
we need to get this going . having the drones made in another country is just not a good idea .
the science of product assembly ( i.e. manufacturing ) has advanced to minimize human input . products are designed so they can only be assembled in a single ( correct ) way , integrated statistical process control schemes flag abnormal conditions , vision systems use bar codes to ensure the correct components are being used , etc . the simple fact is that these [[MONEY]] investments , made to improve [[ORDINAL]] time quality ( [[ORG]] ) , are [[ORG]] to society . our challenge is disguised as manufacturing , but the real problem is elevating the skill level of our least skilled people .
well said
[[ORG]] is a real dictatorship party and evil party and wants to eliminate all capitalist countries and western countries having democracy freedom，to eliminate all private ownership , to eliminate all private companies and people ’s freedom ( free thinking and speaking ) . this is [[ORG]] 's purpose and [[ORG]] initial heart---- make communism in the world ! if people , the ceo , the investor , the politician in [[GPE]] and [[NORP]] countries still do not wake up , still do n’t realize how evils of [[ORG]] , finally you will not only lose your money , your investment , your company , your freedom , your honor and respect but also you will become the slaves and zombies under the threaten and control of [[ORG]] once [[ORG]] gets more power or you more rely on [[ORG]] !
too many presidents and members of [[ORG]] have helped [[GPE]] buy or steal [[NORP]] tech . we have been betrayed . time to stop . no investment by [[GPE]] in any [[GPE]] tech or software , no collaboration on space related missions . the people need to be vigilent , we have beensold down the river .
i look around and see [[DATE]] crumbling infrastructure in states like [[GPE]] and the fact we ca n't even secure our own borders , and frankly question our ability to start from scratch and build a fleet of drones . looking at states like [[GPE]] i seriously doubt we will ever get back to " made in the [[GPE]] " ever again , as much as i would love for [[GPE]] to do that . [[NORP]] have an agenda and a whole list of priorities for tax payers dollars that revolve around spending and investing [[MONEY]] taking care of illegal immigrants , doubt there will be any money left over for drones .
point a power wash nozzle at the thing and knock it down with a high pressure blast . later claim you thought it was a large mosquito . this would work better in [[DATE]] . it could be a fun game !
good luck with that . they 'll be 3x the price .
that is right ! ! - and 3x the number of [[NORP]] manufacturing workers who are currently doing nothing much right now ( except maybe working in the service industry ( serving coffee ) )
and ? ? an iph is 3x the price as an android .
[[GPE]] is great at copying the appearance of quality products . quality and performance not even close . that goes for every product [[GPE]] produces . every single one .
not for their military technology they are smoking us in computers hacking and codes and building super computers .
it 's past time to deploy electronic sweeps on any goods coming in from [[GPE]] prior to them be available to he public . [[GPE]] plan flood the market gather all the intel they can until the slow moving [[ORG]] and administration catch on and make change to policies . past time to become proactive vs reactive .
i thought drones were bad . they 're good again ? [[PERSON]] , okay , build away .
[[GPE]] must cut down on [[NORP]] imports and sell goods made in [[GPE]] .
ah . star wars .... attack of the drones .
well , we ve been clutching really big smartphones for [[DATE]] and [[DATE]] . none of this info should come as utterly shocking : internet and all matters digital come from space - we knew that in the 90 's . next time you tap directions on your phone , maybe you ll think about this .
[[GPE]] just got the [[ORG]] to obey and implement the [[NORP]] internet rules on the world . [[ORG]] is now the military surveillance arm of [[NORP]] [[GPE]] , and [[ORG]] is now enslaved to the [[NORP]] way of life . it is time to disband the [[ORG]]
my co. will not do business in [[GPE]] for this very reason . i must say i am surprised this was actually happening . i 've worked contracts with the [[ORG]] and [[GPE]] and they always specified everything be ' made ' in the [[GPE]] including computer chips and assemblies .
time to expand itar .
they do the same with all those little [[ORG]] products .
why is the [[GPE]] fed gov buying anything from the [[NORP]] ?
the obama admin was being paid off . and since [[PERSON]] hates the [[GPE]] , it was easy . just look at the uranium one and sale of our nuclear production capabilities . obama not opposing the [[GPE]] / [[NORP]] pipeline . obama 's refusal to sell the missiles to [[GPE]] who then bought them from [[GPE]] . all action of treason and a desire to europeanize the [[GPE]] and sell out for big bucks to [[GPE]] . just the tip of the iceberg of the [[GPE]] , clinton , [[PERSON]] , biden sellout .
finally some common sense . it is incredible that we ever let [[GPE]] tax dollars purchase a n y thing [[NORP]] for [[GPE]] gov use .
got that right ! !
how about this .... how about [[ORG]] repatriating jobs to the [[LOC]] by building a couple of [[ORG]] / [[ORG]] plants in [[LOC]] countries . while it may not be ' as cheap ' of labor as that found in [[GPE]] , it would still be reasonable as compared to current product markups that they profit on from the [[ORG]] . the added bonus to the [[GPE]] would be to improve employment opportunities and economies in [[LOC]] and undercut the reason that so many attempt to illegally migrate to the [[GPE]] . what say you , [[ORG]] ?
ask the [[ORG]] shareholders how they feel about a decline in their share price and dividend and you 'll have your answer
but ... is n't [[ORG]] always saying that we should be community conscious and supportive of meeting the needs of all peoples over the needs for profit ?
[[ORG]] shareholders , their easy money gains and what they 've done with those profits , driving up the cost of housing and good services in this country , are the very least of the majority 's concerns . to [[ORG]] with [[ORG]] .
i could not agree more . i was simply responding to the reality of op 's proposal . the shareholders rule - capitalism . we could force [[ORG]] to adhere to op 's ( excellent ! ) idea - socialism .
share price was right at an all time high [[DATE]] . do n't know about any dividend .
sorry , i meant if they made that proposed manufacturing move . certainly riding high now , hence my point .
[[NORP]] have been showing their true colors conserning many issues one of the biggest is [[GPE]] ! [[NORP]] have purposely been selling out to [[GPE]] ! trump is turning that around ! this proves [[NORP]] are aligned with [[ORG]] as they are really [[NORP]] [[NORP]] ! our oligarchs are really [[NORP]] billionaires who whish political power ! vote [[NORP]] 2020
" according to dji ’s own terms and conditions , the company has permission to collect and use your data and users are warned that data may be transferred to servers located in [[GPE]] . " the [[NORP]] just never learn . they build a successful product and then sabotage their own work because they ca n't resist the urge to cheat .
quit buying garbage and the maker of the garbage goes out of business . same principles apply to elected officials ... quit buying their garbage , and make them go away .
obama was really a trojan horse sent here to destroy [[GPE]] from within .
see liberals , this is what real leadership and [[ORG]] is .
what [[NORP]] have allowed to happen to [[NORP]] industry and technology will be change in [[DATE]] , especially in relation to [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] and the [[ORG]] ! [[PERSON]] 2020
the [[NORP]] can never think an original thought they are masters at copying our technologies and duplicating for the good of their government . we should not be scared of them they will implode under [[PERSON]] new trade agreement coming up .
[[GPE]] is [[ORG]] what happens when greed for money by corporations fuses with government need to survive and control .
google supports [[NORP]] hegemony for the almighty bucks .
not to worry - [[GPE]] defence spy electronics are developing mini - micro spy devices small enough to be implanted in soybeans and corn kernels . soon soybeans and corn exported by the [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] will be able to reveal everything about [[GPE]] and their human and animal feed consumption habits , including even such vital information as the makeup of their internal digestive systems .
burrrrrpppppp .... really , that sounds very interesting ....
[[NORP]] would just capitulate and give them what they want . remember , they have been siding with [[GPE]] over this trade deal . [[NORP]] will always side with foreigners . [[PERSON]] will try to get mire money from them and sell our country .
except [[GPE]] ofc . lmao .
now the question is , will the [[GPE]] support a healthy competitive drone industry , or is some politician ’s brother being outfit with a big grant and contract to supply all the drones ?
about damn time
we need [[NORP]] drones fuelled with [[NORP]] coal ! [[ORG]]
[[GPE]] and [[NORP]] are the existential threat to [[GPE]] security and success of our nation
if [[NORP]] made drones are considered national security threats whether used by civilians or government agencies , they should be made it illegal , with significant legal penalties for their procurement or use by anyone . drones are not a necessity for most people . they are merely a [[ORG]] thing .
the [[NORP]] know our drone technology , they helped built it . i know , your politicians in action letting a [[NORP]] country help build our defense weaponry ... [[ORG]] ! the [[NORP]] have already sold the counter defense technology to [[GPE]] , that 's how they shot our drone down ( it was n't a lucky shot ) . all our drones are useless , who knows how much money wasted . again , from the actions of " smart " people ... wow ...
[[ORG]] , [[PERSON]] got that backwards ... the [[GPE]] built the [[ORG]] technology [[GPE]] .. [[ORG]] and [[GPE]] universities and investments .... the designs [[GPE]] the investment [[GPE]] over 50 % the sales and marketing [[GPE]] .... trump is making the world aware of issues that have been overlooked for [[DATE]] ...
not to be facetious but where do the parts and assembly come from ? i do n't know , i thought [[GPE]] . when i was in the military , everything came from [[GPE]] , but i did n't deal with high tech weapons , truely curious .
before [[PERSON]] opened up [[GPE]] the [[NORP]] would illegally migrate to [[GPE]] for a better standard of living . [[CARDINAL]] [[PERSON]] convinced business to give [[NORP]] labor something to do .... [[CARDINAL]] us universities opened research and development departments to [[NORP]] 3.chinese officers / professors who were in [[GPE]] as " students " .... [[CARDINAL]] leadership created the " new regulations " that allowed for some capitalism as long as the ownership was [[PERCENT]] [[NORP]] government . [[CARDINAL]] policy said that no capital was to be " won " from [[GPE]] ... that is to say that selling a product in [[GPE]] will not provide a profit over the value of investment in [[GPE]] . [[CARDINAL]] invested in [[GPE]] 7.manipulaton of currency that keeps exports cheep and imports expensive in [[GPE]] 8.all information and tech gathered by the " students " used to impliment copy factories and even copy servers . if a shoe was being made in [[GPE]] there was a copy factory making a similar version for the [[NORP]] in many many cases ... 9.china says sooner or later [[GPE]] will rule the world and [[GPE]] will use the weapons tech that [[GPE]] bought legally to do it . 10.companies continue to move factories to [[GPE]] and almost never see a real profit other than product sold in the [[GPE]] . i can keep going down the list but the reality is all tech was stolen in one form or another and western governments allowed it and universities still allow it .
why would we let this happen in the [[ORDINAL]] place ?
so , we are adding new drones . big deal . that is old technology . what about the new [[NORP]] hypersonic missile that just went operational [[DATE]] ? nothing here on [[ORG]] about that development . i guess they do n't want to portray [[PERSON]] as being right .
keep in mind that one of these wonder weapons just blew up [[DATE]] . the [[NORP]] are projecting , just like they always have .
[[NORP]] hyper sonic missiles huh ? tell me , what has changed because they have these missiles ? can they survive an attack on the [[GPE]] ? what [[GPE]] is doing , reporting the development of wonder weapons is a classic strategy of trying to appear more powerful than you really are .
i certainly hope the us military is on top of [[PERSON]] . [[CARDINAL]] manned aircraft costs more than say [[CARDINAL]] drones . instead of [[CARDINAL]] manned aircraft , send [[CARDINAL]] drones to a target . some will get thru . i 'm sure [[GPE]] is already using this idea . we should not be buying anything militarily related from [[GPE]] . to think they ca n't jam the drones they sell us is being naive .
you ca n't jam a drone that is encased in a [[ORG]] . artificial intelligence allows drones to fly entire missions without any human intervention .
on a related note : import tariffs introduced by president [[PERSON]] aimed at protecting [[NORP]] manufacturers have actually caused job losses and higher prices for consumers , according to a study published by [[ORG]] . in [[DATE]] , the [[ORG]] administration introduced steel and aluminum tariffs to counter what the president described as " aggressive foreign trade practices . " the president also took aim at [[NORP]] goods as he started a trade war with [[GPE]] that may be soon eased with a preliminary trade deal . however , [[ORG]] economists [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] concluded that any gains made by the tariffs in reducing competition for some [[GPE]] domestic industries were cancelled out by rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs . no one , including [[ORG]] , has dealt well with [[GPE]] since [[PERSON]] .
hard to see how manufacturing something in [[GPE]] causes [[GPE]] job losses versus manufacturing the same thing in [[GPE]] .
wrong . i am in sales and have been selling [[NORP]] products in the [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] . the tariffs are causing [[GPE]] manufacturers to move their contract manufacturing and component sourcing to other countries and in many cases to the [[GPE]] . tariffs are working and if we have to pay more for products typically coming from [[GPE]] , so what . the [[NORP]] government is not our friend , and it is the [[ORDINAL]] time in [[DATE]] our government has sent [[GPE]] a wake up call .
see , you are thinking logically and realistically , unlike the misnamed individual you are responding to . tariffs cause short term pain to the citizens of the countries where the tariffs originate - but long - term gain for the same citizens , while causing pain - short term and long term to the businesses and nations being targetted by those same tariffs . right now , [[NORP]] pay a bit more for [[NORP]] - originated products . but as companies realize the cost of doing business in [[GPE]] , they move out to more ' tariff - friendly ' locations / nations and then the cost goes back down for [[NORP]] , and they also have some better security . but for the [[NORP]] , a ) they sell less products to [[GPE]] , b ) companies leave their shores for better places and thereby cost the [[NORP]] jobs , c ) which raise the costs to care for their own now - unemployed citizens . and considering that [[GPE]] , in spite of all they 've done , are sitting on some static or stagnant economic numbers , this is hitting [[GPE]] much harder than it is [[GPE]] . and if these companies move from [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] , then more [[NORP]] get employed , taking away the jobs from [[NORP]] employees , and also costing the [[NORP]] officials their percentage of the grift they charge foreign companies to exist in [[GPE]] . [[PERSON]] , win , win , for [[GPE]] ; lose , lose , lose for [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] are locked inside a [[NORP]] trap that , they do not know how to extricate themselves from .
interesting ! you do n't hear many people referencing [[NORP]] theory ... i 'm not disagreeing with you ... over - population in limited locations may well bring about a lot of problems .
i must say this is quite refreshing to see an intelligent conversation on a message board !
[[ORG]] closes slowly , but inexorably . [[GPE]] has to feed [[CARDINAL]] people [[DATE]] . that is not sustainable .
and many do n't realize that [[GPE]] may look vast ... , but much of it is pure desert ! you ca n't feed that [[CARDINAL]] sand !
add to that the issue of demographics and health . most of [[LOC]] is aging precipitously . and in [[GPE]] , a large percentage of the population have cardio - pulmonary problems .
no coincidence that for many people on many days the populace in the large cities wear those masks to help filter the air they breath so badly laced with pollutants .
[[GPE]] has gotten so dependent on cheating and stealing that they no longer know how to compete legitimately . once again , president [[PERSON]] saves [[DATE]] .
in a significant way you can thank the [[PERSON]] , obama and definitely [[PERSON]] at lease we have the common sense at this point to try and mitigate the risk perfectly rational thing to do
solve the problem of turning off electronics in rogue drones . drones to fight other drones . also , in ultimate case of defense : [[CARDINAL]] words : metal storm
[[GPE]] technology is developing faster than any other country . [[NORP]] technology is decidedly inferior . when the [[GPE]] dominates the high - end drone market - and it will - the [[NORP]] will not be able to keep pace .
[[PERSON]] opened the door , all the other presidents walked in and out of the door , and [[ORG]] is closing it so he can at least look thru the peephole . [[GPE]] = cheap ..... usa = great
[[GPE]] will never stop stealing [[GPE]] proprietary technologies no matter what trade agreements signed by both countries . there should be stiff penalties every time [[GPE]] is caught cheating . tariffs should be enforced indefinitely ! ! ! !
[[ORG]] has some of the longest lasting drones in the world .
the sooner the [[GPE]] distance itself from [[GPE]] the better . it seems to me that [[NORP]] philosophy is to deceive and cheat on everyone . i believe in the long run that will lead to their downfall .
and [[GPE]] will steal the data as always , because that 's what they do . they 're not smart or innovative enough to produce a new technology on thier own . they 're thieves at dna level .
now the [[NORP]] are going to get us . sorry , our own politicians from both parties sold us to [[GPE]] to help pay the contractors supplying our troops all over the world .
very interesting ! this could use more public exposure in the media ! i have to admit , i 've had the same perspective vis - a - vis other electronic devices produced in [[GPE]] like cell phones , tablets , and laptop computers . i personally feel that [[ORG]] and our military services should not be procuring any electronic devices from [[GPE]] ... ever ! there is just too much risk of exposure to hidden malware and/or coding embedded within hardware components that could support extraction of information to [[GPE]] .
get rid of your [[ORG]] then cause the majority are made in [[GPE]]
i 'd prefer they move their production to [[GPE]] ! and , based on the profit / phone ... keep the current prices while [[ORG]] absorbs the decrease in profit .
you 'd think that not selling us out to [[GPE]] would be a priority for the government ... you 'd think ...
would n't it be nice if a drone could spot intellectual property right violations as they happen ?
oh boy . i ca n't wait till they ban [[NORP]] drones and a basic [[NORP]] consumer drone costs as much as a car !
sucks that dji got [[ORDINAL]] ’s site scan technology . i still have my [[ORDINAL]] solo , converted to open source open solo . very good drone .
i 've said this for [[DATE]] , and as an active environmentalist ( very different from an environmental activist ) it 's the only reason i support increased economic and industrial expansion : economic security is national security !
kudos ! well said .
" dji ’s conquest of the [[GPE]] drone market represents just the latest example of [[GPE]] ’s economic aggression . " let 's be honest . it represents [[GPE]] 's ability to both innovate and embrace capitalism by providing a better product at a cheaper price , but bravo on [[ORG]] for recognizing that we can not let [[GPE]] take the lead . if only the [[ORG]] regime could see the same wisdom when it came to things like wind power and solar panels . those are the future , not coal .
have you been certified , or are you a free range idiot ?
are you kidding ? [[GPE]] is a [[NORP]] country whose means of production is controlled by the state using slave labor . they steal technology and require any company that works with them to give their proprietary info to them . and we let them . as to solar and wind , they can not power any country by themselves , not even close . no matter how many turbines or solar panels you erect they never will .
[[GPE]] innovates ? please . they steal . and we 've let them . trump is stopping it .
better product ? odd words about chinese manufacture . but cheaper , yes , because it is heavily government - subsidized . you willing to have our government do the same ?
solar power also controlled by [[GPE]] . we will end up right back where we were . dependant on despots . the answer lies in scrubbing , storing and recycling carbon . [[NORP]] ingenuity could accomplish that if we were n't so obsessed wind and solar .
no , they 're just plain stealing technology .
agree , but we will also have to use energy more efficiently . i would love to see the wind and solar production be centered in coal country -- miners need to work . coal miners work hard , [[TIME]] per week in terrible conditions , but make [[PERCENT]] per year . we also need a smart person to figure out how to burn plastic in a clean way ; it is made out of hydrocarbon but releases nasty chemicals when burned .
well the liberals idea of eliminating all manufacturing in the [[GPE]] for green considerations plays right into the [[NORP]] plans for complete domination because if we can not make anything for ourselves then we become completely dependent on those that can .
[[GPE]] ’s [[CARDINAL]] plan outlines their goals . and while the [[ORG]] worries about coal mining jobs we fail to improve our [[PERSON]] programs in education ... [[PERSON]] is clueless ...
how can we improve our [[PERSON]] when the h1b visas take the jobs . this is the biggest fraud going on [[DATE]] which only enrich the [[ORG]] billionaires with low wages .
we stopped educating long ago , when liberals took over our schools , turning them into test - score factories and indoctrination centers for progressive , anti - god , [[NORP]] globalists .
and secretary [[PERSON]] is doing nothing to address these issues ...
the [[NORP]] steal every technology available . next up , [[ORG]] . bad move borrowing money and building in [[GPE]] . any manufacturing plant in [[GPE]] is [[PERCENT]] owned by government . previous admin did nothing !
really [[CARDINAL]] wars and a failing housing and car industry . you forgot
rebuilding ? ? ? ? ? come on the [[GPE]] was the last country to get involved , [[GPE]] is the birth place , ( [[PRODUCT]] ) well over [[DATE]] , the [[NORP]] in their normal fashion stole the code , those of us who started out with [[PERSON]] back before the [[NORP]] hit the market were consistently road blocked by the government , as far as multi - rotors the [[GPE]] industry has basically been selling [[NORP]] equipment
[[GPE]] is stealing our technology and using it to spy on and collect data from us . the dji drones are but [[CARDINAL]] example .....
knowing what the [[NORP]] are doing and have always done can be used to our advantage . they steal everything . let 's keep our enemies close and let them find out what we want them to find out and not much more . time to be smart about this and stop the whining we 've been doing for [[DATE]] .
[[GPE]] has already spread its influence worldwide and grown into a most wealthy and modern country whose infrastructure is probably [[ORDINAL]] to none essentially thanks to a free trade with the us.fortunately america that has always overstretched itself has suddenly awakened to the realization that the ongoing decoupling from [[GPE]] is irreversible and above all salutary .
there ’s never been anything free about trade with [[NORP]] communists .
the negative press that [[GPE]] manufacturing gets at times is maddening . we are the world 's leader in manufacturing technology . [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] are really good , but we are great . manufacturing has been taking some hits over [[DATE]] , but we are rebounding right now . buying a toaster or even a [[NORP]] car is [[CARDINAL]] thing , but letting them make components or final assemblies for anything defense related is just plain stupid . our government and manufacturing companies need to put the [[GPE]] [[ORDINAL]]
i certainly hope we do the same thing to critical weapons we sell to foreign governments ... software backdoors .. remote , self destruct mechanisms ... at least ways to cripple them if they are used against us .
the [[GPE]] tech industry has already been hurt by [[GPE]] government interference in spying . be careful in demanding that we become like [[GPE]] and other despotic regimes .
