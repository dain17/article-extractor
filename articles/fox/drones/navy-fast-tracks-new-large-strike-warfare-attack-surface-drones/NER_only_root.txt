the military is increasing it 's use of drones because they are having problems finding new recruits , who can read , write and do one push up .
this is far reaching technology ... hmmm .... dangerous times we 're building up too :/
go get 'em ! !
i would say go after the [[NORP]] submarines but when god is against you , you will not win . repent and accept jesus christ
i wonder if [[LAW]] will be a sub ?
question is , does the [[GPE]] still maintain naval and military superiority with [[GPE]] , and others , stealing our technology ?
so , we 'll have floating or flying service stations that meet up with the autonomous drones when needed . well , what happens when one of our fast attacks or a larger scale [[GPE]] runs into one ? nobody 's going to radio , " uh , [[GPE]] . we got a problem ! " [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] command i knew was totally [[NORP]] and never said a word to the [[PRODUCT]] , at least , that i heard . maybe that 's anecdotal but i do n't think so . no c.o. wants to hang his , or her , but out so [[GPE]] [[PRODUCT]] can take a bite out of it . protocol is important but a sound career is more important .
[[NORP]] prefer the obama class submarine [[ORG]] flying the rainbow flag manned by fruits .
where 's [[PERSON]] when you need him !
since everything is made in [[GPE]] nowadays , i will assume that [[GPE]] ’s military has a billion of them already but they wo n’t fly for very long because of the quality
interesting idea . some of the underwater drones used against pirates and other small vessels would not need to carry a torpedo capable of taking out a large ship . a smaller torpedo would work for that mission and the drones could carry more of them .
