i am amazed at how happy people [[DATE]] are to give up their rights and liberties for fake sense of security and a ( welfare ) nanny state . no i do n't want drones on me ... everyone applauding this does n't understand the slippery slope of governmental tyranny . soon you will have no rights you are basically signing off on [[DATE]] ( ... against unreasonable searches and seizures ... ) by cheering this on . 2a is already withering away steadily ... the greatest constitution given to us by greatest founding fathers who allowed the citizenry every protection against themselves ( executive and legislature ) did not do all this so you can put these on a platter and give to back any government . keeping ther rights is your duty to yourself and your generations to come . make no mistake ...
now that 's a proper usage of drones .
we do need more surveillance since the [[NORP]] still do n't have full control of the [[GPE]] . but not to worry , they are using the crisis , ca n't let it go to waste , to get more and more controls on we the people . like so many restrictions on the 2a that only the criminals will be armed and the [[NORP]] are just loving it . all law abiding citizens need insurance and a license and extensive training and the their criminal army will not have to abide by any of the new [[CARDINAL]] " rules "
[[LOC]] has lowest coronavirus death toll . probably cause its hot there and the virus does nâ€™t do well in heat
been a [[ORG]] news viewer for [[DATE]] . i 'm very close to changing my news source since they consistently remove posts that are absolutely not racist , profane nor vile in nature . heavy censorship is taking hold and i 've begun to notice they 've been sensationalizing many of their headlines lately .
the gods must be crazy !
why not use this on the [[NORP]] border ? except it wo n't be dropping test kits
hmmm ... we are using [[NORP]] drones in [[LOC]] , but we are using [[NORP]] spy drones here ... hmmm ...
maybe drop some birth control while you 're at it
drones in [[GPE]] ? the [[ORG]] crowd would go bat - ship crazy and shoot up the governor 's house .
that 's okay we do n't need any drones over here you just keep them over there
nothing good has ever come from [[LOC]] why bother ? ? ? follow the money to pelosi investments
the next tool for de blasio , [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] in the fight to control the sheep- surveillance drones to seek out violators of their draconian orders .
it could be used to track those who might have the virus , then call in for pickup .
they have too operate like that ... the " [[NORP]] " will steal the truck and kill all the white people if they show up in person ...
use [[LOC]] as a test bed .... [[CARDINAL]] chance anyone sues if anything goes wrong . they must have been secretly doing this before the virus outbreak all along to get by liability restrictions here . no doubt driverless cars are probably zipping around there too . no matter what they say , these are all just trying to eliminate jobs . in the end only the company building it makes out .... the workers lose jobs and a living ... and nothing gets any cheaper .
this makes [[CARDINAL]] sense . all of [[LOC]] comprising of [[CARDINAL]] countries have much fewer cases than in the [[GPE]] . use these drones in [[GPE]] .
great story . hope this makes it to [[GPE]] .
maybe works for the light [[NORP]] rural population , , [[QUANTITY]] of supplies would n't even dent the amount needed by [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] city hospital in [[DATE]] . ridiculous article .
