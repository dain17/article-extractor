[[ORG]] is a poorly managed company . they administer the testing for our insurance and repeatedly have messed up the reporting on their own website . spent literally days trying to get it fixed or we would be billed $ [[MONEY]] in extra cost , all due to their own mistakes .
seems to be rather elaborate and unreliable . without the supervision of a technician can we trust the results ? what if someone else takes the test , not the intended person ? what if the family dog attacks the drone or chews the test before it can be used ? or a child picks it up and plays with it before an adult knows its there or retrieves it ? what if the drone gets stuck on power lines or trees ? what if the drone is launched with low charge ? i 've heard of larger birds of prey plucking a drone out of the sky . or someone decides to blast [[CARDINAL]] out of the sky . no , not probable but eventually , these sorts of things will happen or have happened and need to be considered .
drones for health !
remember all those stories about how [[ORG]] , and others were going to be delivering with drones , lol ? i said at the time it was all a pr campaign , to get free publicity . and , now it is clear that was true . perhaps someday this may happen on a limited basis but as a pilot , i can tell you weather is far to unpredictable in most of the country for that to be a viable method of operation .
would the drones benfit from flying lower to the ground than you would in a plane ? is the weather a little more predictable lower to the ground than what you 'd run into at [[QUANTITY]] of elevation ? btw , i obviously have no idea how this works , it 's an honest question , so please do n't just laugh at me for being meteorologically ( sp ? ) challenged .
in an urban area flying low is good idea because tall buildings will create a thermal effect similar to mountain ridges at higher altitudes .
i thought there was a law against surprise bills from medical insurance ? remember that helicopter ride during the emergency that cost you $ 50k. why do i think that this is a mini version of this ?
the drone service is donated by [[ORG]] and the covid-19 tests are donated by [[ORG]] .
the test may be free .. the results are not .. someone is getting paid somewhere or they would n't be doing it .. do n't be naive ..
* facepalm *
this is just a bunch of boys playing with their toys . what a waste of time and money .
exactly .
how stupid .. hurry and deliver test , then send it back in the mail .. get results [[DATE]] . how about test and return by drone , [[DATE]] results ?
well it is really about automation to eliminate more employees . as the governments start mandating increasing wages to employees more automation goes into play . as the wages increase the employee costs go up and automation becomes ever more attractive . look at the big stores , they already use self checkout lanes and only a handful of cashiers now . then at [[TIME]] the cleaning robots come out . they even started using robots to check inventory and even do limiting restocking too . [[ORG]] is heavily automated in their warehouses .
you are right , i agree .
and how can you be sure this is not a way for [[PERSON]] , and the dr. [[PERSON]] to further spread corona to you so they can be the saviors ?
because there are far simpler and more effective ways to spread a virus than this .
i would n't touch that test or '' cure '' for covid with [[QUANTITY]] pole !
[[ORG]] turns blue and then this ! ! they are getting smart
i must have missed something about [[ORG]] elections . they vote trump for president , [[NORP]] for the [[ORG]] , and [[CARDINAL]] out of [[CARDINAL]] seats in the house were [[NORP]] . i would not call that turning blue .
sure they are smart . shutting down the mainstay of their economy . now that is really encouraging .
yup , life before liberty . that is how it is written in the declaration of independence .
you are delivering tests via a drone for a virus that has a [[PERCENT]] survival rate ? ? ? ? ? madness ..
rough looking lawn - mower .
