[[ORG]] is a poorly managed company . they administer the testing for our insurance and repeatedly have messed up the reporting on their own website . spent literally days trying to get it fixed or we would be billed $ [[MONEY]] in extra cost , all due to their own mistakes .
seems to be rather elaborate and unreliable . without the supervision of a technician can we trust the results ? what if someone else takes the test , not the intended person ? what if the family dog attacks the drone or chews the test before it can be used ? or a child picks it up and plays with it before an adult knows its there or retrieves it ? what if the drone gets stuck on power lines or trees ? what if the drone is launched with low charge ? i 've heard of larger birds of prey plucking a drone out of the sky . or someone decides to blast [[CARDINAL]] out of the sky . no , not probable but eventually , these sorts of things will happen or have happened and need to be considered .
drones for health !
remember all those stories about how [[ORG]] , and others were going to be delivering with drones , lol ? i said at the time it was all a pr campaign , to get free publicity . and , now it is clear that was true . perhaps someday this may happen on a limited basis but as a pilot , i can tell you weather is far to unpredictable in most of the country for that to be a viable method of operation .
i thought there was a law against surprise bills from medical insurance ? remember that helicopter ride during the emergency that cost you $ 50k. why do i think that this is a mini version of this ?
* facepalm *
this is just a bunch of boys playing with their toys . what a waste of time and money .
how stupid .. hurry and deliver test , then send it back in the mail .. get results [[DATE]] . how about test and return by drone , [[DATE]] results ?
and how can you be sure this is not a way for [[PERSON]] , and the dr. [[PERSON]] to further spread corona to you so they can be the saviors ?
i would n't touch that test or '' cure '' for covid with [[QUANTITY]] pole !
[[ORG]] turns blue and then this ! ! they are getting smart
you are delivering tests via a drone for a virus that has a [[PERCENT]] survival rate ? ? ? ? ? madness ..
rough looking lawn - mower .
