I think it is instructive.  You claim your entire assignments were 2 years as a LTC + 1 year as a 2LT + 1 year as an XO and presumably 1 year as battalion staff?  So your total assignments were 5 years in total.  Correct?  You must have been amazing.  5 years of service in command and I assume you retired as an O-5?  No other service than that?",

My command time as a LTC was 2 years, with 3 years on brigade staff also as a LTC. That's FIVE years. XO is a position and not a grade (if you had served you would know that) and I served as a platoon leader for 1 year and a company XO for 1 year, both as a 2LT. I was promoted to 1LT and moved another XO position and then an instructor position, each for approximately 1 year. Then I became a CPT and assumed command of a company for almost 2 years, after which I moved to battalion staff for a year and then served another year and a half as an instructor (I happen to be very good at my job). I was then promoted to MAJ and spent 2 years on BN staff and another 18 months as a BN XO, then went to a BDE staff as an O4 for 2 years. Now do the math, and you'll see it averages close to 18 months in each position. If you do your job well, the Army is eager to give you new opportunities. If you do your job poorly, you tend to stay in a job for a very long time. \n\nYou really should just stop. You're just embarrassing yourself.",

I based my response on what you wrote in fact.  And the reason I'm asking you questions is to better understand your response.  I'm really getting tired of the childish insults.  But given what I think I'm dealing with, I'm not surprised.\n\nThank you for writing a clearer response.  And I was simply adding up assignments that you stated in your prior response.  I said nothing about XO being a rank at all which makes your snide comment just plain silly.  But that seems to be a theme with you.\n\nSo based on your answer, let me clarify some things for you.\n\nI'm not saying that your assignments within your organizational unit don't change (they often do).  Again, that isn't the problem  My issue was \"average time an officer spends in a unit is 18 months\".  That is the claim that I'm stating is not true.  You don't often move from unit to unit regularly.  For example, a US Army Ranger does not typically (if ever) move from the 75th RR to the 9th Field Artillery Regiment.  Even your own service record shows that is not true.  You remained within the same organizational unit FOR YEARS by your own admission.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you were in the same Field Army for your entire service.",
