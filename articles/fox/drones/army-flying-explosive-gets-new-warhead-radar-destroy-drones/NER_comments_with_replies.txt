" the [[ORG]] is working with industry partners ....... " is this code for some of the stuff was made in [[GPE]] ?
i get it that was funny . thanks good chuckles are always appreciated .
at this point , i guess i have to ask .
um , the drones they shoot are rc fighter aircraft . people love to call anything a drone [[DATE]] .
basically , that is right . most civilians have no idea what they are talking about . rc fighter aircraft is exactly what they imagine . battlefield drones are meant to give you eyes in the sky to assess the battlefield . that means they are flying low over the battlefield and slowly ( or hovering ) . you can easily shoot them down . a rc fighter aircraft would be moving too fast to provide good intel or be useful other than as a kamikaze .
the problem with this is you ca n't deploy this thing in the battlefield . it 's a big target . the enemy is going to blow it up . that 's why i have to wonder about some of the systems designed by military contractors sometimes .
[[PERSON]] ?
it 's not as big as an [[ORG]] or m109 . of course it 's going to be deployed on the battlefield .
we do n't deploy [[ORG]] in the battlefield sparky . mlrs are artillery units . having [[CARDINAL]] sitting there in the middle of our deployed units is just silly and it would be a big win for the enemy since taking it out will create a large number of casualties for our troops .
hey , " [[PERSON]] " , [[ORG]] is on the battlefield . we do n't fight linear wars and have n't since [[EVENT]] . and for reference , i 'm a [[DATE]] field artillery officer and combat veteran . what 's your background ?
[[DATE]] in [[ORG]] and i 've never seen a [[ORG]] sitting anywhere near ground units deployed in combat [[PERSON]] .
why are you so passive aggressive ?
armchair warriors substitute passive aggression for real - world experience .
i think this guy is n't all there . the reason we do n't have [[ORG]] in the middle of ground units engaged in combat is a [[ORG]] is basically a mobile bomb . [[CARDINAL]] lucky shot and you 'll blow up a lot of our guys fighting . what he 's saying is completely ridiculous .
ok , let me point something out to you - call of duty does n't count as real - world experience . you are obviously ignorant of the basic information even a private would be expected to have in the [[ORG]] .
right . and what unit did you serve in tulip ? i do n't believe you 've ever served . but thanks for the laughs cupcake .
if you had really been in the [[ORG]] , you 'd know that would be a question that would take an entire page to answer for a [[DATE]] career . however , on my right shoulder is the patch of the [[ORDINAL]] [[ORG]] ( airborne ) as that 's the unit i was attached to for my longest combat deployment . your ignorance is overwhelming . why do n't you go play with the children and let the grownups talk ?
a page full huh ? you must have been a real problem for your cos to be transferred that often ? well , i 'm not surprised since your genius plan would be to put [[ORG]] in the middle of ground units engaged in combat . my guess is you also were deployed in [[ORG]] and proposed parking some of our airplanes in ground combat zones . lol
again , you show your ignorance . the average time an officer spends in a unit is [[DATE]] . spread that out over [[DATE]] and you end up with a lot of assignments . i 've been in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and all over the [[GPE]] . you really should stop ; the more you type , the stupider you sound - and it 's getting really hard to imagine you getting any stupider ( but that wo n't keep you from trying ) .
lol [[DATE]] ? ! ? i was mostly kidding , but wow - i did n't know how close to the truth i was . thanks for making my day . is your name [[PERSON]] perhaps ?
thanks for proving my points - 1 - that you did n't serve in the [[ORG]] ( you would have known that officers [[DATE]] in an assignment ) ; 2- that the more you type the stupider you sound . and no , i am a ltc , but if you were n't so ignorant , you 'd know that [[PERSON]] was an mi officer and i 've already told you i 'm an artillery officer .
so [[PERSON]] , you were only a ltc for [[DATE]] in the [[ORG]] . strange ? since that is n't what your bio says . you were there a lot longer than that . and i must have broken this rule a lot . i was in centcom for [[DATE]] . i must have done something wrong to not be transferred as often as you . btw - you really have me rolling , but please continue . tell me all these great rules about [[ORG]] that i never knew . [[DATE]] automatic transfer to new units really made my day .
and your combat experience ? if you were really in the [[ORG]] for [[DATE]] , i would think you would have learned about the non - linear battlefield , especially if you had lived it - as i have .
what do you think non - linear battlefield means exactly ? next you 'll be telling me we are parking fighter jets in ground combat zones too .
if you did n't learn that in [[DATE]] , i ca n't teach it to you in this small space . the system is mounted on an lmtv - we use those as gun trucks all over the battlefield . i 've been on [[CARDINAL]] combat patrols . how about you ?
now that was interesting . glad i quit drinking long ago . thank you for your service daeljuma149 .
i doubt he ever served . can you imagine what would happen if after we trained a us army ranger , we then transferred them to a completely new unit [[DATE]] ? it just does n't happen unless you are a major problem and your co needs you gone . sounds like this guy was either a major pain or never served and has no idea what he 's talking about .
they are right .. you never served .. i am [[ORG]] and even i can clearly read your comments and see you are full of cow pie . and guess what ? mrls are on the battlefield .. or do you think just because they are not sitting right on top of boots , that does not count ? you do realize , the enemy also has aircraft , [[PERSON]] 's , rockets , mortars , counter battery and more .. oh wait , no you do n't because you never served .. i hate stolen valor types like you .
have you ever seen a [[ORG]] launch its rockets ? what do you think would happen to ground units deployed around it ? and i do n't care if you do n't believe i served or not . i did not start attacking the supposed service of this person [[ORDINAL]] . he [[ORG]] . perhaps you did n't bother noticing that . for the most part , i just ignored him and was pointing out how silly his claims were . btw - how often do they replace a captain in [[ORG]] ? [[DATE]] as he claims ? i think that will tell you who is speaking the truth .
i am sure he served his country well .
i 'm sure . just be aware , he claims that the average [[ORG]] is [[DATE]] for all officers within a unit before they are moved to a new unit . however , that is n't the average . that is just the minimum [[ORG]] for a [[ORDINAL]] lieutenant . it is [[DATE]] minimum for a captain , [[DATE]] for a major , [[DATE]] for a ltc , and [[DATE]] for a colonel .
man , you really are stupid . he did n't say the average time in grade ( [[ORG]] ) is [[DATE]] for officers . he said the average time of assignment for officers in a position is [[DATE]] , which is true up through battalion commander . you either just ca n't read , or you 're really as stupid as you seem . he burned you . he exposed you as a fraud . deal with it , stolen valor .
oh really ? what was your service record ? were you an officer ? did you change your assigned units regularly [[DATE]] ? prove me wrong .
johnny , you are doing just fine proving yourself wrong .
really ? how many different [[ORG]] units were you in beyond a change in platoon assignments exactly ( assuming you were in [[ORG]] ) ? for example , did you even ever join a unit outside [[ORG]] you were in when you started your service ? i think for most in the service , that is n't usual nor does it regularly happen [[DATE]] at all . and i do n't expect you to answer . i 'm just tired of this nonsense and being told i 'm wrong when the facts are completely on my side .
go ask mommy to change your diaper . we can smell you all the way over here .
that is what i thought . i 'm sick of liberals like you pretending to have served . talk about stolen valor . you epitomize it .
way to deflect . my [[PRODUCT]] says otherwise . you are just a miserable excuse for a human being . you 're probably playing with your blowup [[PERSON]] doll right now .
you never had a [[PRODUCT]] . a real officer is n't afraid of the truth and honestly deal with questions . your childish insults based on [[ORG]] facts says it all .
i 've read through all of his posts and all of yours . it 's obvious you 're the fraud . you 've been called out by numerous veterans here . and as far as [[DATE]] , unless you 're really a slug , that 's about the average time you 'll spend in each position up through battalion commander , with shorter times as an lt and longer times as you move up through the ranks . my command time as a ltc was [[DATE]] , with stellar ratings . my time as a [[CARDINAL]] platoon leader was [[DATE]] , followed by [[DATE]] as a company [[ORG]] , then battalion staff . you do the math .
so , let 's do the math . i think it is instructive . you claim your entire assignments were [[DATE]] as a ltc + 1 year as a 2lt + 1 year as an [[ORG]] and presumably [[DATE]] as battalion staff ? so your total assignments were [[DATE]] in total . correct ? you must have been amazing . [[DATE]] of service in command and i assume you retired as an [[CARDINAL]] ? no other service than that ?
you just really have zero reading comprehension . my command time as a ltc was [[DATE]] , with [[DATE]] on brigade staff also as a ltc . that 's [[DATE]] . [[ORG]] is a position and not a grade ( if you had served you would know that ) and i served as a platoon leader for [[DATE]] and a company [[ORG]] for [[DATE]] , both as a 2lt . i was promoted to [[CARDINAL]] and moved another [[ORG]] position and then an instructor position , each for [[DATE]] . then i became a [[ORG]] and assumed command of a company for [[DATE]] , after which i moved to battalion staff for [[DATE]] and then served [[DATE]] as an instructor ( i happen to be very good at my job ) . i was then promoted to maj and spent [[DATE]] on bn staff and [[DATE]] as a bn xo , then went to a [[ORG]] staff as an o4 for [[DATE]] . now do the math , and you 'll see it averages [[DATE]] in each position . if you do your job well , the [[ORG]] is eager to give you new opportunities . if you do your job poorly , you tend to stay in a job for a very long time . you really should just stop . you 're just embarrassing yourself .
asking questions is actually important for reading comprehension . i based my response on what you wrote in fact . and the reason i 'm asking you questions is to better understand your response . i 'm really getting tired of the childish insults . but given what i think i 'm dealing with , i 'm not surprised . thank you for writing a clearer response . and i was simply adding up assignments that you stated in your prior response . i said nothing about xo being a rank at all which makes your snide comment just plain silly . but that seems to be a theme with you . so based on your answer , let me clarify some things for you . i 'm not saying that your assignments within your organizational unit do n't change ( they often do ) . again , that is n't the problem my issue was " average time an officer spends in a unit is [[DATE]] " . that is the claim that i 'm stating is not true . you do n't often move from unit to unit regularly . for example , a us army ranger does not typically ( if ever ) move from the 75th rr to the [[ORDINAL]] [[EVENT]] . even your own service record shows that is not true . you remained within the same organizational unit for [[DATE]] by your own admission . in fact , i 'm willing to bet you were in the same [[ORG]] for your entire service .
does it work on ice cream filled refrigerators ?
we need a new word for " flying explosive " . if we called them " missles " would people know what we 're talking about ?
it did seem like odd writing to me ...
maybe it was meant for [[NORP]] trolls ? ...
maybe ... there are definitely a few hanging out here .
is that like when you strap a note [[CARDINAL]] to a quad copter , or throw it at someone?<sarcasm alert >
i already have one . at the ranch , it is great fun . it 's called a 12 gauge .
judging by past efforts this ought to come online sometime around [[DATE]] and cost $ [[MONEY]]
like we are wasting on your medical bills ?
well wait till they roll out the photonic cannon !
mr. [[PERSON]] ! fire the [[NORP]] cannon !
photonic canon offline , sir !
you can start with the drones [[GPE]] sent to [[GPE]] police departments to spy
police dept here already found out that those [[NORP]] drones are not that reliable . of the [[CARDINAL]] they bought they have one left . seems they deployed [[CARDINAL]] that never returned or captured any video footage . now the county is under investigation for using funds that were appropriated for something else to buy them with .
practice targets .
why ca n't drones be jammed with electromagnetic waves ?
why in the world do we think we have to show the world ?
it 's kind of like " open carry " . the power of deterrence is almost as effective as having to use it .
i 'm a big [[ORG]] person . even then there are stupid people out there . i had rather just keep it to my self and then do what 's needed ! but , i do see your point and respect your opinion !
i can see it coming , " anti - drone " drones . i am going to develop a military version of a sling - shot , only i will sell each for low - unheard of price of [[CARDINAL]] let 's see if they bite ...
that ’s no match for the anti - anti - drone drone .
in [[GPE]] we write currency like this : $ [[MONEY]] .
yeah , so what ....
he must be a [[ORG]] drone .
they need flying claymore mines for defense ... if you go bird hunting you use birdshot ...
used to call that flak
m 60 with bbs with timed fuse . flak round . fired from a shotgun .
ack -ack
ya ! fliegerabwehrkanone !
we 're wasting our time fighting amongst ourselves . we should be focused on blowing [[ORG]] to bits .
trump 2020 keep them ammo supplies full !
cool , start with the [[NORP]] supplied drones local law enforcement is using to spy on [[NORP]] simply because they 're not locked in the house .
we need the scaled down , consumer version , to take care of the temperature reading drones .
how is that going to solve the covid19 microscopic drones used in biological warfare ? how about solving the murder hornet biological warfare ?
you 're not very bright , are you ? this story is about drones that a potential adversary would use against our military forces . it does not address covid or hornets . not everything is about your pet phobias .
low slow flying ? [[CARDINAL]] gauge shotgun with [[MONEY]] shot should take care of the problem . better yet build a phalanx shotgun array .
the " small " drones they are referring to are still the size of a small car and can fly far too high for a shotgun to reach even when flying relatively low . if it was that simple they 'd be doing that already .
this weapon looks like it could take out like [[CARDINAL]] countries
what a racket . [[ORDINAL]] sell the weapons ( drones ) , then sell the defence .
cool , where can i get one ?
[[CARDINAL]]
when we were kids , we taped fire crackers to those rubber band powered balsa airplanes .
can we get one that targets traitors like [[ORG]] [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] , and the list goes on and on
see if it works on [[PERSON]] when she comes flying her broom over [[GPE]] to attack our rights and freedoms .
[[PERSON]] are outraged .
[[PERSON]] invented [[PERSON]]
a tiny drone killed [[PRODUCT]] .
a good marksman can shoot down a drone . they are n't bullet proof .
yah , the army is shooting down dji " drones " . please
basically . that is pretty much the full capability of our enemies right there . they take a commercial product and use it .
if you 're in [[GPE]] be careful that might be someone 's supper delivery . [[PERSON]] ( that is lol for all you up - to - date ers
a drone moving at [[QUANTITY]] ? not likely . maybe a shotgun at close distance but even hitting a goose at [[CARDINAL]] yds is difficult at [[CARDINAL]] yds near impossible .
damn rich are you from [[GPE]] . down here in [[GPE]] we 're only allowed to shoot at crossed [[NORP]] at [[QUANTITY]] with a [[CARDINAL]] short .
most enemy drones are n't constantly moving at [[QUANTITY]] . they have to be controlled genius by ground controllers ( anything big enough to fly at altitude and be controlled by remote pilot can be taken out by missiles already ) . what they are wanting to take out are drones in combat areas deployed by enemy troops . those drones are flying slowly and hovering ( since troops ca n't be racing around at [[QUANTITY]] on the battlefield ) . it 's an easy shot .
sure genius . easy shot . lol . a drone moving at speed and at 1000 ft can easily get your position and taking out a small drone at that altitude with a missile ? there 's no heat signature . lol . good luck taking down the most dangerous target a drone swarm armed with explosives . you 're daft . why do you think they had to buy the kind of tech in the article ?
we need an anti - crone system to deal with [[GPE]] , di fi , and [[PERSON]] ....
good idea ............ [[ORDINAL]] in my airspace !
god bless america and our great president trump !
