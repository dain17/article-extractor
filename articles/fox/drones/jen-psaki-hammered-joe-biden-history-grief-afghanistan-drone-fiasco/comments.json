        "context": "September 1 2021 FOX NEWS - Biden reportedly has a history of disrespecting Gold Star families\nBiden's meeting with a Gold Star father in 2016 was a 'horrible experience'\n\nThe controversy echoes Biden's reported past treatment of Gold Star families. Mike Iubelt, the father of the fallen Army Pfc. Tyler Iubelt, told the Washington Examiner in October 2019 that he had a \"horrible experience\" meeting the now-president in 2016 after his son's death in Afghanistan a few days earlier. Iubelt said he left their conversation \"feeling worse\" than before. \n\n\"He told my daughter-in-law ... that she was too pretty for this to happen to her,\" Mike Iubelt recalled. \"It's probably a good thing that he was surrounded by Secret Service, probably for both of us, because I'd probably be locked up in jail right now.\"\n\nIubelt's account was similar to how Gold Star families described their recent meetings with Biden. \n\nCheyenne McCollum, one of the sisters of Marine Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, said she met with Biden alongside McCollum’s pregnant widow and that the president would not look at the family in the eye and spent the three-minute conversation talking about Beau, who served in Iraq with the U.S. Army and died in 2015 from brain cancer.\n\n\"I was able to stand about 15 seconds of his fake, scripted apology and I had to walk away,\" Cheyenne told \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nRoice McCollum, another sister, refused to meet with the president but said he showed a \"total disregard to the loss of our Marine",

Biden’s life — the 1972 car crash that killed his wife and baby daughter — has drawn renewed attention over a falsehood that the former vice president repeated for years: that the other driver was drunk.\nFrom 2001-07, Mr. Biden indicated at least twice that the tractor-trailer driver who hit his wife’s car had been drinking, even though the state official who oversaw the investigation and the driver’s daughter said that wasn’t true.\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Pamela Hamill, the daughter of driver Curtis C. Dunn, called on Mr. Biden to apologize publicly after he told a crowd that her father “drank his lunch” before the accident, according to a 2008 article in the Newark [Delaware] Post.\n“A tractor-trailer, a guy who allegedly — and I never pursued it — drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch, broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalized my two sons,” Mr. Biden said in 2007.\nIn a 2001 speech at the University of Delaware, he referred to an “errant driver who stopped to drink instead of drive” and “hit my children and my wife and killed them,”\n———-\nWhat kind of lowlife lies about something like that to score political points?

Did Biden give the pipeline to the Russians as repayment for the $3 million given to Hunter? And has Biden ignored that the virus originated in China becase of money paid to his son? Also did Biden shut down Bagram airbase in Afghanistan at the request of the Chinese, for the money paid to his son. \n\nThis is what America gets when the FBI picks the president.

He feels nothing for any of the US citizens he’s supposed to be leading. When his son Beau was dying Joe Biden got to spend time with Beau. He got to spend some of Beau’s final days with him. The 13 in Afghanistan were not allowed that luxury. In fact I’m willing to bet none of our service members who perished in Afghanistan over the past 20 years had the privilege to have a family member there holding their hand as they drew their last breaths while in combat. It is a disgrace and disgusting to me every time Biden and Psaki bring up Beau Biden. It’s one thing to lose a child to a disease. It is something entirely different when you lose a child to combat or terrorism. Biden is a disgusting and horrible excuse of a president much less a human being. Those who voted for him are equally disgusting. ",
