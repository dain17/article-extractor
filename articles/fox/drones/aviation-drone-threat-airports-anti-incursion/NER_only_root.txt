they have had problems with them at alot of airports and it endangers the safety of plane travel . also had a guy near a resort here that was using a drone and almost caused several cars from going over a cliff .... it is a serous problem ...
track em down , and prosecute them to the full extent of the law .
gremlins ... i swear i saw gremlins !
i wonder why [[ORG]] does not allow jammers around airports !
how about some birdshot from a 12 gauge . yes there are safety issues , relax its a joke ......... or is it
i wish we had an anti - incursion systems for the wacky libs leaving ca .
[[ORDINAL]] shot birdshot , [[ORDINAL]] shot buckshot , after that the gun is [[NORP]] .... buckshot buckshot buckshot . [[PERSON]]
ask [[GPE]] for help , they 're pretty competent in anti - drone tech
rogue drones ? sounds like a job for [[NORP]] with pellet guns .
