headline should read " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
dji can chose to put automated remote identification systems in their [[ORG]] 's any time they want . if they feel it is important they should do so , and market it as an improvement .
just a matter of time before they start delivering bombs with those things ...
[[ORG]] ! ! !
sounds like something [[PERSON]] would do .
shoot em down , and arrest the owners .
not an excuse for more govt . control . we need less govt .
putting a [[MONEY]] [[ORG]] unit on a $ [[MONEY]] drone is going to go over really well . [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , dji and others want to destroy the radio control hobby market so they can take over the airspace for business purposes and profit .
nothing to see here folks , just another [[ORG]] delivery gone awry .
we need to arm stadiums with anti aircraft weapons lol
i bet nobody illegally entered the game . the big walls around the stadium kept people out who did n't have a ticket .
[[ORG]] ... that ‚Äôs [[ORDINAL]] its a [[GPE]] [[NORP]] drone stealing signs ‚úå üèª
what are we all droning on about now ?
terrorist dry run ?
so it 's perfectly legal to use a drone to watch your neighbor 's wife sunbathing but no so to watch a baseball game ?
all fun and games till the drone drops explosives or chemical weapons . if that was n't a dry run for a terrorist attack , i 'm sure a terrorist watching that , just kicked into action .
someone did n't want to pay for a ticket .
[[NORP]] drone trying to sway voters
no restraining order can restrain my love ? .
pay mrs. [[PERSON]] a visit , or has she been deported after her boys blew up the marathon ?
out of practical shotgun range .
it 's just a matter of time before these things are weaponized .
another liberal trying to see the game free , probably streamed the event to all the liberal friends at [[GPE]] .
if i know [[CARDINAL]] thing , its do nt mess with the [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] is just mad because it was probably recording the game and they were n't getting paid for it .
check tha pahhkin lawt , it was someone in a caaaah
oh - the horror !
the people that fly these drones will need to start being regulated and licensed ! they have become invasive and could cause havoc in certain circumstances .
