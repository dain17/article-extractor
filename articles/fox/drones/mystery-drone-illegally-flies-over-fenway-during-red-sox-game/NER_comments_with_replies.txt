headline should read " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
dji can chose to put automated remote identification systems in their [[ORG]] 's any time they want . if they feel it is important they should do so , and market it as an improvement .
they can but the headache is they would then be blocking that legally fly in these situations ( they do exist , there is an [[ORG]] process to get that approval ) .
just a matter of time before they start delivering bombs with those things ...
[[NORP]] powder .
[[ORG]] ! ! !
sounds like something [[PERSON]] would do .
are you sure ? drones do nt have anything to deflate .
shoot em down , and arrest the owners .
not an excuse for more govt . control . we need less govt .
it 's the government 's job to provide safety for its citizens .
putting a [[MONEY]] [[ORG]] unit on a $ [[MONEY]] drone is going to go over really well . [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , dji and others want to destroy the radio control hobby market so they can take over the airspace for business purposes and profit .
nothing to see here folks , just another [[ORG]] delivery gone awry .
we need to arm stadiums with anti aircraft weapons lol
i bet nobody illegally entered the game . the big walls around the stadium kept people out who did n't have a ticket .
that 's what the green monster was built for
[[ORG]] ... that ‚Äôs [[ORDINAL]] its a [[GPE]] [[NORP]] drone stealing signs ‚úå üèª
the [[ORG]] drone operators are currently out of work due to some freshman upstart politician .
what are we all droning on about now ?
ouch
terrorist dry run ?
so it 's perfectly legal to use a drone to watch your neighbor 's wife sunbathing but no so to watch a baseball game ?
all fun and games till the drone drops explosives or chemical weapons . if that was n't a dry run for a terrorist attack , i 'm sure a terrorist watching that , just kicked into action .
how much explosives can a drone carry ? geesh !
if it was a dji phantom drone , probably [[QUANTITY]] of explosives . may not sound like a lot but you drop them into stadium seating where people are squeezed in like sardines , you will have a lot of casualties , plus a lot more injuries from the ensuing stamped to get out of there . open stadiums like that are one of the areas where we are the most vulnerable at the moment . i have seen nothing indicating that the law enforcement has an answer for that problem . this video is evidence of that .
someone did n't want to pay for a ticket .
[[NORP]] drone trying to sway voters
no restraining order can restrain my love ? .
pay mrs. [[PERSON]] a visit , or has she been deported after her boys blew up the marathon ?
out of practical shotgun range .
not with a slug .
not accurate enough , and likely to be dangerous on descent .
it 's just a matter of time before these things are weaponized .
that is truly scary !
another liberal trying to see the game free , probably streamed the event to all the liberal friends at [[GPE]] .
you think liberals actually know how to fly a drone ?
i did n't give it much thought , kinda late on [[LOC]] .... i understand your concern ...
if i know [[CARDINAL]] thing , its do nt mess with the [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] is just mad because it was probably recording the game and they were n't getting paid for it .
check tha pahhkin lawt , it was someone in a caaaah
oh - the horror !
the people that fly these drones will need to start being regulated and licensed ! they have become invasive and could cause havoc in certain circumstances .
