they had their own amazon drone delivery service
never trust a grown man with a transformers sticker on the back of his vehicle ‚Ä¶
why the surprise ? it 's [[GPE]] . red state .
i 'm surprised this has n't been done with guns .
that was a great piece of police work that ended well . üëç i 'd like this unit to oversee the midterm election count .
i 'd say this guy is n't real bright . instead of [[CARDINAL]] yrs how about just a .45
[[ORG]] certification , how big was the drone ?
the jail population is alive and well , they are having more fun inside than in real life .
now the the fun stuff is over , you can join your friends on the yard crew for [[MONEY]] can hour , for [[DATE]] .
well , here ‚Äôs a guy putting his tech skills to work , giving him a vocation . unfortunately , i am not sure how many prisons he might be sent to will need his skills . if in fact he does any real time for his crime . perhaps the military could use him , if he ‚Äôs vaccinated of course .
will he be joining his friends ? ? ?
good idea !
[[ORG]] is hiring ‚Ä¶ to fly drones of course ‚Ä¶ .
[[NORP]] who support [[EVENT]] and banning drugs and banning abortion ‚Ä¶ when the constitution mentions neither ‚Ä¶
why use a drone , just pay off the guards like always happens .
now that ‚Äôs a creative expression of blackness !
" [[PERSON]] ? " " pat , pat , pat ... usual ! [[PERCENT]] !
" a " for creativity , " f " for execution .
cool . must have thought it was a good idea at the time . lol
cool .
imagine if he pleas a deal dropping every charge except for - ' serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate ' . imagine the employment questions he will get [[DATE]] ...
a baseball player could had thrown them .
gee he ‚Äôs black . never would have figured .
[[ORG]] ?
come on man . let him fly all the fentanyl into the prison as he wants . need to thin the prison population .
i have a great idea i bet there is no cameras around a prison . with so many black people around they ca n't identify me . after this i 'm going to run for [[FAC]] , but not before i hike up gas prices , club a baby seal , and hit the hash pipe
i wonder how many actually make it . enough to make it worthwhile , or they would n't keep doing it . it is kind of impressive . i know i could n't pull it off . ü§≠
where there is a market , there is someone willing to provide the service . drugs , [[ORG]] , ( formerly ) [[ORG]] , sex , etc . at some point people may get smart enough to regulate it like other countries do , and at least not fund the criminals ( fund the criminals in suits /shrug )
i did n't know you have to have a license to operate a drone ? ! ? ! talk about government overreach ! ! ! ! what 's next ? mandate a nasal recovery certificate to make money off people who pick their nose . or maybe they 'll require citizens , over [[DATE]] , to wear government issued under pants to measure methane output as a means of taxation to support green energy .
[[DATE]] in prison , he is going to need someone to drone in some stuff .
either he did or he did n't . what 's with the ' allegedly ' all the time .
pat , please add 1 to my 1659 consecutive correct puzzle answers .
[[NORP]] want to defund police / prisons . open season- anything goes !
[[DATE]] for drugs for criminals and some cell phones ? who cares ?
reminds me of the [[PERSON]] film ‚Äú breakout ‚Äù .
so now you care ?
if these clowns put [[CARDINAL]] of the effort into a legit business that they put into their criminal activities ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
drone boy is gon na love the view from the other side of the walls .
and this is our monkeypox . it 's nothing new , really .
on paper , it seemed like a great plan .
this could be obama 's son ... if he gave him a drone .
fantastic ! use a [[GPE]] ! !
too much weight for a drone that size . they got sloppy
the usual suspects .
if convicted , [[GPE]] faces [[DATE]] in prison . you get less time than this for killing [[CARDINAL]] people in [[GPE]] .
not a very good security system .
13%er . the [[NORP]] love child
[[ORG]] unions say that there is still only one thing that they have yet to see in any prison ... [[PERSON]]
a neighboring county sheriff recovered a large drone that was used for prison smuggling . they worked with the drone 's manufacturer and got new controls for it . now the [[PERSON]] uses it for surveillance and searches .
[[GPE]] has a reputation for being hard on criminals . i hope he enjoys his time in prison beside his buddy 's he did n't deliver the goods to [[ORG]] .
its funny this made [[ORG]] . this happens in [[GPE]] prisons all the time . smh . ü•±
can you say [[PERCENT]] ! üòÇ [[PRODUCT]] [[PERSON]] ü§£
he ‚Äôs practicing sending paraphernalia to trump when he goes behind bars .
much effort into breaking laws , no effort in earning a legitimate living
black . did n‚Äôt even read the article - just the headline .
[[PERSON]] , i ‚Äôll take ‚Äú monkeys going airborne ‚Äù for $ [[MONEY]] please .
another criminal genius who did n't quite think things through .
he 's a treetop flyer ....
flying high , again .... oh no , oh no here we go now , here we go now oh no , oh no here we go now got a crazy feeling i do n't understand got ta get away from here [[PERSON]] ' like i should 've kept my feet on the ground [[ORG]] ' for the sun to appear [[PERSON]] 's gon na worry i 've been a bad , bad boy no use saying sorry it 's something that i enjoy 'cause you ca n't see what my eyes see ( i can see it , i can see it ) and you ca n't be inside of me flying high again ..... üòÖ üÉè
his dream of living in a gated community will soon come true .
he was n't very bright about it .
serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate , well that ‚Äôs a new one too me
wow ! who could 've ever thought of that ploy ! those guards must 've been wicked smart ... [[PERSON]]
this really angers the guards as it cuts into the money they make bringing contraband into the prison .
may he get [[DATE]] . he endangers the staff and the inmates .
a search uncovered debit cards with [[GPE]] 's name on them - ha ha ha ha ha . i guess he is n't very bright ! [[PERSON]] . you lose .
a criminal big who has no regard for the law as usual
that single count of serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate is the one that will put him away for [[DATE]] .
those guards do n't appreciate the competition in the contraband game .
[[CARDINAL]] time a crow flew into my fenced backyard , it dropped a liberal then flew away .
nowhere in the constitution does it say you ca n‚Äôt fly a contraband laden drone into a prison yard .
well , i give him credit for using tech in such a way . but low marks for not realizing there are cameras every where .
at least he has a real job ...
of all the places to park he picks a school loaded with video surveillance .
i 'll bet this entrepreneur forgot to pay their " fair share " in taxes . the [[ORG]] will be going after him , too .
[[CARDINAL]] to the chest , one to the dome will do .
what ‚Äôs next , a [[QUANTITY]] handgun ?
pat , i solved this puzzle .
but he has an [[ORG]] sticker on his vehicle . he should change it to a [[ORG]] .
‚Äú [[PERSON]] ‚Äù is all i needed to hear . i ‚Äôm sure the drone was stolen .
drone jamming !
he went too big ..... my guess he 's been delivering for a while .
was it [[ORG]] ? he can get you things
his middle name is n't [[GPE]]
wait for it ....... [[ORG]] will . be flying drones across the border ....
why not set up a cell phone jammer ?
not quite tuskegee airmen quality .
those [[NORP]] are really coming around with the technology .
well , now he can be in prison , or better still , tie him to a drone and just drop him !
[[ORG]] is impressed .
we used to smuggle phones into prison using drones all the time when we were kids . of course , they were rotary phones and the drone was made from helium balloons ...
what no smokes ? just drugs and phones ?
ape logic + technology = fail .
wait for it ..... wait for it .... * and released [[DATE]] ! "
they do n‚Äôt catch the smart ones . is n‚Äôt there someway we can get this down to [[PERCENT]] ?
[[DATE]] and still trying to figure out what he wants to be when he grows up .
all crimes aside . this man is light years ahead of [[ORG]] . take that [[PERSON]] .
according to his facebook page , this guy was in [[ORG]] . he now joins the ranks of [[NORP]] having dishonored himself and the [[ORG]] .
blacks are n't intelligent enough to properly navigate a drone over a [[QUANTITY]] fence ! ! ! ! but they are able to physically [[ORG]] over a [[QUANTITY]] fence though .
let me get this right . there is a high school next to a prison . i guess you can call that continue education .
gone hi tech eh ! prisons should install antidrone devices . why so low tech of prisons ? i guess biden defunded prisons too .
primates and [[PERSON]] do n't mix well .
lol ! well at least he was being creative .
what he did , would be considered innovative by the [[NORP]] in charge .
please reserve a cell next to his buddies in the prison that he tried to send the drugs . and keep him there for a very long time . he is worthless on the outside .
correction officers provide phones , drugs , [[ORG]] cards , ‚Ä¶ everything üòÇ
throw the book at him .
hilarious ! i hope it was cash up front before delivery üòÇ
prisons should use this technique against the prisoners and solve the drug problem once and for all . simply drop drugs laced with poison over every fence and let em have it . prisoners would never trust drugs on the inside again . put gps trackers on the cell phones and then bust the ones that are caught with them . after a few examples , drugs and cell phone use stops .
authorities quickly discovered video footage of a nearby high school what ! , that school looks pretty close to prison .
that autobot sticker though ‚Ä¶
does he identify as a man ? he could say he was a woman and it was n‚Äôt him .
later identified as [[PERSON]] charges were dropped .
[[ORG]] the new fl rampant with crime .
sounds like a real rocket scientist ! maybe he should have practiced a bit more before going in !
[[ORG]] delivery ?
[[ORDINAL]] this has happened a lot so it should shock no one secondly i love that they keep doing it like come on
if he had installed a self destruct mechanism he would n‚Äôt have been caught
truth be told u should n't need a license to fly a drone as a civilian but i agree he should be prosecuted for everything else .
[[PERSON]] ? just another uncivilized , sub - human üêí
[[PERSON]] invented drones . oh , and prisons too ! !
creative , i ‚Äôll give the thug that .
the guards smuggle 90 percent of all contraband into prisons it 's a fact during covid whe prisons were n't allowing visits wardens were n't scrambling to explain how stuff was still getting inside
pat , i can deliver a solution to this puzzle on the fly . [[PERSON]]
if convicted , [[GPE]] faces [[DATE]] in prison . if .
give him all 45 .
[[ORG]] to walk upright before you fly ...
does n‚Äôt this prison have guards with shotguns ? how can a drone get inside ?
you have to admire his work ethic . bet he ‚Äôs a major contributor at his company .
i think illegally flying the drone , is probably the least of his problems .
[[PERSON]] has a long criminal history that includes drugs and family violence . looks like he will be going away for a while .
flying drugs and phones into a prison yard ? is there nothing that [[PERSON]] is n't into ? that little rascal !
it was a remake of [[PERSON]] movie [[ORG]] . the slogan is " we deliver on time , every time or it 's free "
the drone was also laden with illicit cuttings of [[PERSON]] pubes .
was ‚Äú the man ‚Äù black ? ? ? ? ?
i guess the guards can be grateful they were n't fire arms
[[DATE]] ! i hope it was worth it ! üò≥ üôÑ üòÉ üòÑ
how can giving the people what they need get you [[CARDINAL]] yrs . feed prisoners drugs alcohol and weapons . perfect
well well weeeelll ! blm again . surprise surprise !
doin' the pigeon doin' the pigeon people may smile , but i do n't mind they 'll never understand the kind of fun i find . doin' the pigeon
clearly not red , a man that can get you things .
[[GPE]] was considering him as assistant secretary of [[ORG]] before this mishap .
