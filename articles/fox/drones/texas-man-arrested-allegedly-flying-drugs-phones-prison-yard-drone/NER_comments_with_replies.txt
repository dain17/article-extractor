they had their own amazon drone delivery service
never trust a grown man with a transformers sticker on the back of his vehicle ‚Ä¶
why the surprise ? it 's [[GPE]] . red state .
i 'm surprised this has n't been done with guns .
that was a great piece of police work that ended well . üëç i 'd like this unit to oversee the midterm election count .
i 'd say this guy is n't real bright . instead of [[CARDINAL]] yrs how about just a .45
[[ORG]] certification , how big was the drone ?
the jail population is alive and well , they are having more fun inside than in real life .
now the the fun stuff is over , you can join your friends on the yard crew for [[MONEY]] can hour , for [[DATE]] .
well , here ‚Äôs a guy putting his tech skills to work , giving him a vocation . unfortunately , i am not sure how many prisons he might be sent to will need his skills . if in fact he does any real time for his crime . perhaps the military could use him , if he ‚Äôs vaccinated of course .
will he be joining his friends ? ? ?
good idea !
[[ORG]] is hiring ‚Ä¶ to fly drones of course ‚Ä¶ .
[[NORP]] who support [[EVENT]] and banning drugs and banning abortion ‚Ä¶ when the constitution mentions neither ‚Ä¶
so you agree , abortion is not protected as a constitutional right ...
why use a drone , just pay off the guards like always happens .
now that ‚Äôs a creative expression of blackness !
" [[PERSON]] ? " " pat , pat , pat ... usual ! [[PERCENT]] !
" a " for creativity , " f " for execution .
cool . must have thought it was a good idea at the time . lol
cool .
imagine if he pleas a deal dropping every charge except for - ' serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate ' . imagine the employment questions he will get [[DATE]] ...
a baseball player could had thrown them .
gee he ‚Äôs black . never would have figured .
the drone crashed , did n't it ?
[[ORG]] ?
come on man . let him fly all the fentanyl into the prison as he wants . need to thin the prison population .
i have a great idea i bet there is no cameras around a prison . with so many black people around they ca n't identify me . after this i 'm going to run for [[FAC]] , but not before i hike up gas prices , club a baby seal , and hit the hash pipe
i wonder how many actually make it . enough to make it worthwhile , or they would n't keep doing it . it is kind of impressive . i know i could n't pull it off . ü§≠
where there is a market , there is someone willing to provide the service . drugs , [[ORG]] , ( formerly ) [[ORG]] , sex , etc . at some point people may get smart enough to regulate it like other countries do , and at least not fund the criminals ( fund the criminals in suits /shrug )
i did n't know you have to have a license to operate a drone ? ! ? ! talk about government overreach ! ! ! ! what 's next ? mandate a nasal recovery certificate to make money off people who pick their nose . or maybe they 'll require citizens , over [[DATE]] , to wear government issued under pants to measure methane output as a means of taxation to support green energy .
i forget [[DATE]] . but i think that in [[DATE]] , drones had to be registered / licensed .
[[DATE]] in prison , he is going to need someone to drone in some stuff .
either he did or he did n't . what 's with the ' allegedly ' all the time .
' legal ' talk . ca n't say they did it , until after the trial .
liability
pat , please add 1 to my 1659 consecutive correct puzzle answers .
judges ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we will accept this , [[ORG]] üòÉ who ‚Äôs ready for the speed round
[[NORP]] want to defund police / prisons . open season- anything goes !
[[DATE]] for drugs for criminals and some cell phones ? who cares ?
the funny part is . he 's probably supplying the stuff to folks who were sentenced to [[DATE]] .
reminds me of the [[PERSON]] film ‚Äú breakout ‚Äù .
so now you care ?
if these clowns put [[CARDINAL]] of the effort into a legit business that they put into their criminal activities ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
... then we 'd need an extra [[FAC]] [[ORG]] agents for audit purposes !
drone boy is gon na love the view from the other side of the walls .
and this is our monkeypox . it 's nothing new , really .
on paper , it seemed like a great plan .
this could be obama 's son ... if he gave him a drone .
fantastic ! use a [[GPE]] ! !
too much weight for a drone that size . they got sloppy
yep . i have a ' drone ' that can carry 6 pounds of ' cargo ' . with a fully charged battery , it will fly for [[TIME]] . i can pre - program the flight , or sit inside and use my laptop to control it .
the usual suspects .
if convicted , [[GPE]] faces [[DATE]] in prison . you get less time than this for killing [[CARDINAL]] people in [[GPE]] .
not a very good security system .
built by the lowest bidder , like everything the govt buys
you 're not wrong .
13%er . the [[NORP]] love child
[[ORG]] unions say that there is still only one thing that they have yet to see in any prison ... [[PERSON]]
oh , now , you know that 's not true ... she been visiting [[PERSON]] a lot lately ...
a neighboring county sheriff recovered a large drone that was used for prison smuggling . they worked with the drone 's manufacturer and got new controls for it . now the [[PERSON]] uses it for surveillance and searches .
[[GPE]] has a reputation for being hard on criminals . i hope he enjoys his time in prison beside his buddy 's he did n't deliver the goods to [[ORG]] .
its funny this made [[ORG]] . this happens in [[GPE]] prisons all the time . smh . ü•±
can you say [[PERCENT]] ! üòÇ [[PRODUCT]] [[PERSON]] ü§£
black person would have mailed it . they do n't know how to fly a drone :))) ) ) )
he ‚Äôs practicing sending paraphernalia to trump when he goes behind bars .
still mad about saint [[PERSON]] ?
you 'll be in prison before anyone in [[ORG]] 's family .
much effort into breaking laws , no effort in earning a legitimate living
black . did n‚Äôt even read the article - just the headline .
[[PERSON]] , i ‚Äôll take ‚Äú monkeys going airborne ‚Äù for $ [[MONEY]] please .
another criminal genius who did n't quite think things through .
he 's a treetop flyer ....
flying high , again .... oh no , oh no here we go now , here we go now oh no , oh no here we go now got a crazy feeling i do n't understand got ta get away from here [[PERSON]] ' like i should 've kept my feet on the ground [[ORG]] ' for the sun to appear [[PERSON]] 's gon na worry i 've been a bad , bad boy no use saying sorry it 's something that i enjoy 'cause you ca n't see what my eyes see ( i can see it , i can see it ) and you ca n't be inside of me flying high again ..... üòÖ üÉè
[[ORG]] solo .. , , , , , , , ,
his dream of living in a gated community will soon come true .
maybe on his way to prison he can fill his pockets with drugs and cellphones .
he was n't very bright about it .
serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate , well that ‚Äôs a new one too me
wow ! who could 've ever thought of that ploy ! those guards must 've been wicked smart ... [[PERSON]]
this really angers the guards as it cuts into the money they make bringing contraband into the prison .
those are facts . i have family inside .... one cell phone fetches 2k to 3k ... guess who brings them in . hint . not the [[LOC]] booth .
i was falsely imprisoned for [[DATE]] for someone else ‚Äôs cannabis .
how many pounds was that ?
[[QUANTITY]] is what i had . they pulled me into someone else ‚Äôs conspiracy .
may he get [[DATE]] . he endangers the staff and the inmates .
a search uncovered debit cards with [[GPE]] 's name on them - ha ha ha ha ha . i guess he is n't very bright ! [[PERSON]] . you lose .
a criminal big who has no regard for the law as usual
that single count of serving as an airman without an airman ‚Äôs certificate is the one that will put him away for [[DATE]] .
those guards do n't appreciate the competition in the contraband game .
[[CARDINAL]] time a crow flew into my fenced backyard , it dropped a liberal then flew away .
you need to call [[ORG]] when that happens .
nowhere in the constitution does it say you ca n‚Äôt fly a contraband laden drone into a prison yard .
i think it 's protected activity . something about the pursuit of happiness .
it does n't mention it in the [[WORK_OF_ART]] either , so i guess it 's cool .
well , i give him credit for using tech in such a way . but low marks for not realizing there are cameras every where .
and you need a man on the inside to create a distraction .
or a guard to let you onto the roof .
at least he has a real job ...
of all the places to park he picks a school loaded with video surveillance .
and adding enhancement laws
i 'll bet this entrepreneur forgot to pay their " fair share " in taxes . the [[ORG]] will be going after him , too .
[[CARDINAL]] to the chest , one to the dome will do .
that would be fitting ... the " [[WORK_OF_ART]] . "
no reason to waste a good drone
he did n't say drone .
ahh my bad , thanks for the correction . i ‚Äôll leave my error up for the deserved humiliation
although would have been a good play on words .
what ‚Äôs next , a [[QUANTITY]] handgun ?
some folks are already doing that . not hard to do ...
pat , i solved this puzzle .
but he has an [[ORG]] sticker on his vehicle . he should change it to a [[ORG]] .
‚Äú [[PERSON]] ‚Äù is all i needed to hear . i ‚Äôm sure the drone was stolen .
and had chrome rims
drone jamming !
he went too big ..... my guess he 's been delivering for a while .
was it [[ORG]] ? he can get you things
( in [[ORG]] voice . ) when i [[ORDINAL]] met [[GPE]] . i said . now there 's a guy that was n't in line when they were handing out brains .
he got me a nice rock hammer . it only took me [[DATE]] to tunnel my way out .
his middle name is n't [[GPE]]
wait for it ....... [[ORG]] will . be flying drones across the border ....
they 're already doing it
why not set up a cell phone jammer ?
cell phone jammers also jam radios that the officer ‚Äôs need to communicate with .
not quite tuskegee airmen quality .
those [[NORP]] are really coming around with the technology .
well , now he can be in prison , or better still , tie him to a drone and just drop him !
[[ORG]] is impressed .
we used to smuggle phones into prison using drones all the time when we were kids . of course , they were rotary phones and the drone was made from helium balloons ...
[[ORG]] ! ! !
takes a really long cord .
what no smokes ? just drugs and phones ?
ape logic + technology = fail .
wait for it ..... wait for it .... * and released [[DATE]] ! "
they do n‚Äôt catch the smart ones . is n‚Äôt there someway we can get this down to [[PERCENT]] ?
[[DATE]] and still trying to figure out what he wants to be when he grows up .
all crimes aside . this man is light years ahead of [[ORG]] . take that [[PERSON]] .
according to his facebook page , this guy was in [[ORG]] . he now joins the ranks of [[NORP]] having dishonored himself and the [[ORG]] .
i like that ..... ex marine ... not a former marine . good job distinguishing the [[CARDINAL]] .
marine turned criminal .. sad
so what , [[NORP]] embarrassed themselves all the time .
no , we just do the unexpected ..............
if true , then yes he is a disgrace to all [[NORP]] service members !
blacks are n't intelligent enough to properly navigate a drone over a [[QUANTITY]] fence ! ! ! ! but they are able to physically [[ORG]] over a [[QUANTITY]] fence though .
let me get this right . there is a high school next to a prison . i guess you can call that continue education .
continuing
they can go back and forth easily
gone hi tech eh ! prisons should install antidrone devices . why so low tech of prisons ? i guess biden defunded prisons too .
because they keep outsourcing control of prisons to private security companies , who spend the absolute least they can running them .
primates and [[PERSON]] do n't mix well .
lol ! well at least he was being creative .
what he did , would be considered innovative by the [[NORP]] in charge .
please reserve a cell next to his buddies in the prison that he tried to send the drugs . and keep him there for a very long time . he is worthless on the outside .
correction officers provide phones , drugs , [[ORG]] cards , ‚Ä¶ everything üòÇ
well , that 's what he gets for cutting in on their action
says the convict !
throw the book at him .
hilarious ! i hope it was cash up front before delivery üòÇ
black . he 'll serve no time .
prisons should use this technique against the prisoners and solve the drug problem once and for all . simply drop drugs laced with poison over every fence and let em have it . prisoners would never trust drugs on the inside again . put gps trackers on the cell phones and then bust the ones that are caught with them . after a few examples , drugs and cell phone use stops .
fentenyol [[PERSON]] .
authorities quickly discovered video footage of a nearby high school what ! , that school looks pretty close to prison .
that autobot sticker though ‚Ä¶
does he identify as a man ? he could say he was a woman and it was n‚Äôt him .
later identified as [[PERSON]] charges were dropped .
ü§£ ü§£
funny considering you are a [[NORP]] who supports an unconstitutional [[EVENT]] . remind me where it says drugs are bad in the good book ?
good [[CARDINAL]]
[[ORG]] the new fl rampant with crime .
any state with a sudden influx of [[NORP]] voting freeloaders in the new ( insert name of any state with significant amount of [[NORP]] voting freeloaders )
not very smart are you
sounds like a real rocket scientist ! maybe he should have practiced a bit more before going in !
[[ORG]] delivery ?
[[ORDINAL]] this has happened a lot so it should shock no one secondly i love that they keep doing it like come on
if he had installed a self destruct mechanism he would n‚Äôt have been caught
truth be told u should n't need a license to fly a drone as a civilian but i agree he should be prosecuted for everything else .
[[PERSON]] ? just another uncivilized , sub - human üêí
[[PERSON]] invented drones . oh , and prisons too ! !
creative , i ‚Äôll give the thug that .
the guards smuggle 90 percent of all contraband into prisons it 's a fact during covid whe prisons were n't allowing visits wardens were n't scrambling to explain how stuff was still getting inside
pat , i can deliver a solution to this puzzle on the fly . [[PERSON]]
if his middle name was leroy maybe . but [[PERSON]] , might be a challenge . just saying .
a+ for a creative twist !
that is definitely [[CARDINAL]] high tech piece of farm equipment !
ü§£
if convicted , [[GPE]] faces [[DATE]] in prison . if .
give him all 45 .
[[ORG]] to walk upright before you fly ...
does n‚Äôt this prison have guards with shotguns ? how can a drone get inside ?
you have to admire his work ethic . bet he ‚Äôs a major contributor at his company .
i think illegally flying the drone , is probably the least of his problems .
[[PERSON]] has a long criminal history that includes drugs and family violence . looks like he will be going away for a while .
flying drugs and phones into a prison yard ? is there nothing that [[PERSON]] is n't into ? that little rascal !
it was a remake of [[PERSON]] movie [[ORG]] . the slogan is " we deliver on time , every time or it 's free "
the drone was also laden with illicit cuttings of [[PERSON]] pubes .
was ‚Äú the man ‚Äù black ? ? ? ? ?
i 'm guessing yes just based on the middle name " [[PERSON]] "
could be [[NORP]]
might have been dark [[GPE]] .
i guess the guards can be grateful they were n't fire arms
[[DATE]] ! i hope it was worth it ! üò≥ üôÑ üòÉ üòÑ
how can giving the people what they need get you [[CARDINAL]] yrs . feed prisoners drugs alcohol and weapons . perfect
well well weeeelll ! blm again . surprise surprise !
doin' the pigeon doin' the pigeon people may smile , but i do n't mind they 'll never understand the kind of fun i find . doin' the pigeon
clearly not red , a man that can get you things .
[[GPE]] was considering him as assistant secretary of [[ORG]] before this mishap .
üòÇ ü§£
bro is an entrepreneur making [[CARDINAL]] clown . his lawyer already got him out on bail . heard he ‚Äôs running for [[ORG]]
and a presidential medal of freedom .
before , more likely now is considering him for the job .
