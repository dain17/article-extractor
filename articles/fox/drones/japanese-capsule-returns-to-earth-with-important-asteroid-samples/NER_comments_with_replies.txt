[[NORP]] made big discovery when examining the materials , they found [[PERSON]] lost space car @ !
" [[NORP]] capsule returns to [[LOC]] ... " a flat out lie . it has not returned . it has performed some maneuver in space . let me know when it has landed and it 's contents are intact . i heard it could not close properly before it left the asteroid . it may be empty or full of [[NORP]] desert dust . false , lying headline .
that is too cool . congrats to jaxa !
we 're all gon na die from covid or from some kind of face mask induced fungus .
dirt , they found dirt . they found it on the [[PERSON]] and some day we will have [[LOC]] dirt samples . strangest thing , we have dirt right here on [[LOC]] . the only difference is our dirt contains life . thank you lord
does anyone remember the ' andromeda strain ' ?
a very boring movie . no worries there is no life on asteroids . all life is right here on [[LOC]] and accounted for . solar and cosmic radiation and extreme heat and cold and lack of food take care of any that escapes . god is out there but he ‚Äôs tough . he can handle it .
if we do n't destroy ourselves [[DATE]] will be very interesting .
i find it interesting that there is as much water on planet earth as the whole volume of the moon and yet as close to the earth as the moon is why is there no water on the moon ? and it seems the moon is in a perfect position in our solar system as a planetary object to support some sort of life considering how much life exists on planet earth ? all the elements of life somehow hit the earth on a massive scale and thrived , yet somehow completely missed the moon , not to mention [[LOC]] ? just some food for thought , [[ORG]] [[CARDINAL]]
there is much water in a frozen state on the moon . most o which is stored underground . a planet with no atmosphere and massive temperature changes can not support live as we know it on earth .
the moon and the [[LOC]] are nearly identical in makeup , however in a collision between [[LOC]] and another planetoid , the heavy elements like iron would have been retained on [[LOC]] . and the heat produced during the impact and the ejection into space would have boiled the lighter elements off while the rest of the material would have mixed . so if the difference is that the moon has less iron and less of the lighter elements such as hydrogen , the only water would be that that fell from comets . it also has low gravity and next to no atmosphere , so surface water would sublimate into space unless hidden at the poles in shade . the same lack of atmosphere results in extreme temperature variations and high radiation issues . or so the story goes ....
nonsense ! ! why is it so hard to give credit where credit is due ?
you question me not giving credit , yet you yourself question the outcome . no faith ?
great job [[GPE]] ! ! ! ca n't wait to see what the next [[NORP]] , mission is .
so , [[GPE]] is gon na have to be nuked to stop the " organic materials " from ending life on planet [[LOC]] .
it wo nt end life , just change it .
to boldly go where no man has gone before .
outstanding ! ! ! ! hopefully , another [[ORG]] for mankind ! ! ! !
godzirra embryos are onboard that capsule ... look out !
maybe our capsules can accidently land in [[GPE]] , releasing some alien pathogens ?
well done [[GPE]] [[GPE]] . so much more meaningful than putting an ugly wuhan infected flag on the moon
the biggest ? can the [[NORP]] build a voting system for [[GPE]] that s legitimate ?
they found some ballots for [[PERSON]] there too !
more outlandish claims from [[ORG]] to brainwash the masses regarding our ' origins ' ( [[PERSON]] is a member of [[ORG]] 's duping ' space mafia ' ) . the capsule will be dropped from a cargo plane at high altitude - the same trick that they have been employing since the ' space race ' .
and the earth is flat and stationary right ? people like you need to open a book once in a while .
did i ever say either ?
why would they do that ? why not just say it was dropped off from a satellite .
oh right , [[GPE]] is on it the evil conspiracy against your insanity , i forgot .
smith , please be quiet .. you have no clue as to the reason for the mass deception .
from [[GPE]] will love üá∫ [[PERSON]] [[GPE]] ‚ô°
a wok ( rock ... [[NORP]] talk ) from space .
asteroids ... may help explain how the earth evolved . ugh . science fiction alert .
we know how the earth formed . :d we 're looking at how the solar system formed .
and life started , that part scares themm the most .
i keep directing them to the [[ORG]] article on abiogenesis , and [[NORP]] , hysterically , has said he 's read it all and even made edits to the article .
[[ORG]] now has competition for [[ORG]] trophy
would n't the money have been better spent as a donation to [[ORG]] or some other charity that helps underprivileged ?
nope .
the space agency in [[GPE]] is feeling so proud and they should . a similar feat to compare to is : a medieval archer shoots an arrow at [[QUANTITY]] into a small loop of [[QUANTITY]] in diameter while the loop is swinging sideways . fantastic ! and they had a return challenge . just great ! ! ! ! now to see what the asteroid is composed of and if this planet can use some of the minerals .
and please [[GPE]] do n't share the [[ORG]] with [[ORG]] , if they want it let them hack it .
maybe the sample will explain why [[GPE]] has such a high suicide rate .
remember [[PERSON]] !
[[ORG]] !
when the [[NORP]] get done with the [[ORG]] content analysis , maybe they could take a look at the [[NORP]] and figure out why the wheels fell off the wagon and they turned to socialism . anyhow congratulations on a job well done .
sounds like it ‚Äôs down . well done .
[[ORG]] ! i hope they get the sample intact . i want to read about what they find .
in a related issue , does anybody really think that we ‚Äôll spend [[MONEY]] to land a craft next to the [[LOC]] lander , bringing back to earth , [[LOC]] soil samples , [[DATE]] after they were dug up ?
the capsule probably never left earth . they hid it for [[DATE]] and then dropped it from a plane making it look lie a landing . remember the capsule 's name " folk tale " . very appropriate .
such an appropriate name for yourself .
i hope the asteroids they tapped will rain down on [[GPE]] and not cause harm to the rest of the world when they hit [[LOC]] .
why kind of stupidity is this supposed to be ?
next step to old and gray is the only certainty in life . wish you speedy forward .
the zombie - kangaroo apocalypse is about to begin ...
my thoughts exactly ... or perhaps [[PERSON]] meets [[PERSON]] .
lol ... [[CARDINAL]] ft tall and knocking buildings down with his hind feet .
exactly ! have a good one .
[[GPE]] is still among the best in a number of areas in science and technology . glad they remain an ally and hope that is still true [[DATE]] .
why does [[GPE]] have money for a space program when the [[GPE]] is still spending [[CARDINAL]] for their defense ?
[[NORP]] agency did it with pretty low cost in comparison .
they have printing presses just like the rest of the world to print their worthless money .
einsten , you answered your own question
" in the beginning god created the heavens and the [[LOC]] . " gen [[CARDINAL]]
... and he did it as a gesture of love to all he 's created . amazing .
and told us the was a ocean in space and that the earth was created before the sun , all which is wrong .
were you there [[PERSON]] ( other word for a donkey ) ?
if you can prove that let us know :d
amazing feat . i love this stuff . will returned cargo contain proof that earths religions are ancient fairy tales ? i do nt know but do n't think so . just dust .
and ...... now the zombie apocalypse starts .
including the [[PERSON]] ... great .
you did not capture that . [[PERSON]]
i feel this is all so unnecessary as the funds spent could be better used on social programs for those to lazy to do anything for themselves , [[NORP]] are such over achievers and tend to vote and promote in such a responsible way which seems outrageous to those cultures of lazy , victim - hood mentality . this is why the " great reset " is needed to bring down those of achievement / hard work to socially acceptable levels where liberal politicians do n't feel threatened
wait your turn , [[GPE]] .
proves godzilla & rodan do exist ! but as i type there is a one [[ORDINAL]] delay & ‚Äú ahh , ohh ‚Äù in between each letter . just like the voice over does n‚Äôt match lips
excellent feat . congratulations [[GPE]] .
what feat ? it 's not on the ground , yet .
are you kidding ? look at what this mission has accomplished so far .
what has it accomplished ?
funny thing was they actually saw [[PERSON]] ‚Äôs email server on its surface .
