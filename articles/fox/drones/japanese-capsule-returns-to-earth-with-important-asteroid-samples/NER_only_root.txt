[[NORP]] made big discovery when examining the materials , they found [[PERSON]] lost space car @ !
" [[NORP]] capsule returns to [[LOC]] ... " a flat out lie . it has not returned . it has performed some maneuver in space . let me know when it has landed and it 's contents are intact . i heard it could not close properly before it left the asteroid . it may be empty or full of [[NORP]] desert dust . false , lying headline .
that is too cool . congrats to jaxa !
we 're all gon na die from covid or from some kind of face mask induced fungus .
dirt , they found dirt . they found it on the [[PERSON]] and some day we will have [[LOC]] dirt samples . strangest thing , we have dirt right here on [[LOC]] . the only difference is our dirt contains life . thank you lord
does anyone remember the ' andromeda strain ' ?
if we do n't destroy ourselves [[DATE]] will be very interesting .
i find it interesting that there is as much water on planet earth as the whole volume of the moon and yet as close to the earth as the moon is why is there no water on the moon ? and it seems the moon is in a perfect position in our solar system as a planetary object to support some sort of life considering how much life exists on planet earth ? all the elements of life somehow hit the earth on a massive scale and thrived , yet somehow completely missed the moon , not to mention [[LOC]] ? just some food for thought , [[ORG]] [[CARDINAL]]
great job [[GPE]] ! ! ! ca n't wait to see what the next [[NORP]] , mission is .
so , [[GPE]] is gon na have to be nuked to stop the " organic materials " from ending life on planet [[LOC]] .
to boldly go where no man has gone before .
outstanding ! ! ! ! hopefully , another [[ORG]] for mankind ! ! ! !
godzirra embryos are onboard that capsule ... look out !
maybe our capsules can accidently land in [[GPE]] , releasing some alien pathogens ?
well done [[GPE]] [[GPE]] . so much more meaningful than putting an ugly wuhan infected flag on the moon
the biggest ? can the [[NORP]] build a voting system for [[GPE]] that s legitimate ?
they found some ballots for [[PERSON]] there too !
more outlandish claims from [[ORG]] to brainwash the masses regarding our ' origins ' ( [[PERSON]] is a member of [[ORG]] 's duping ' space mafia ' ) . the capsule will be dropped from a cargo plane at high altitude - the same trick that they have been employing since the ' space race ' .
from [[GPE]] will love üá∫ [[PERSON]] [[GPE]] ‚ô°
a wok ( rock ... [[NORP]] talk ) from space .
asteroids ... may help explain how the earth evolved . ugh . science fiction alert .
[[ORG]] now has competition for [[ORG]] trophy
the space agency in [[GPE]] is feeling so proud and they should . a similar feat to compare to is : a medieval archer shoots an arrow at [[QUANTITY]] into a small loop of [[QUANTITY]] in diameter while the loop is swinging sideways . fantastic ! and they had a return challenge . just great ! ! ! ! now to see what the asteroid is composed of and if this planet can use some of the minerals .
maybe the sample will explain why [[GPE]] has such a high suicide rate .
remember [[PERSON]] !
[[ORG]] !
when the [[NORP]] get done with the [[ORG]] content analysis , maybe they could take a look at the [[NORP]] and figure out why the wheels fell off the wagon and they turned to socialism . anyhow congratulations on a job well done .
sounds like it ‚Äôs down . well done .
[[ORG]] ! i hope they get the sample intact . i want to read about what they find .
in a related issue , does anybody really think that we ‚Äôll spend [[MONEY]] to land a craft next to the [[LOC]] lander , bringing back to earth , [[LOC]] soil samples , [[DATE]] after they were dug up ?
the capsule probably never left earth . they hid it for [[DATE]] and then dropped it from a plane making it look lie a landing . remember the capsule 's name " folk tale " . very appropriate .
i hope the asteroids they tapped will rain down on [[GPE]] and not cause harm to the rest of the world when they hit [[LOC]] .
the zombie - kangaroo apocalypse is about to begin ...
[[GPE]] is still among the best in a number of areas in science and technology . glad they remain an ally and hope that is still true [[DATE]] .
why does [[GPE]] have money for a space program when the [[GPE]] is still spending [[CARDINAL]] for their defense ?
" in the beginning god created the heavens and the [[LOC]] . " gen [[CARDINAL]]
and ...... now the zombie apocalypse starts .
including the [[PERSON]] ... great .
you did not capture that . [[PERSON]]
i feel this is all so unnecessary as the funds spent could be better used on social programs for those to lazy to do anything for themselves , [[NORP]] are such over achievers and tend to vote and promote in such a responsible way which seems outrageous to those cultures of lazy , victim - hood mentality . this is why the " great reset " is needed to bring down those of achievement / hard work to socially acceptable levels where liberal politicians do n't feel threatened
proves godzilla & rodan do exist ! but as i type there is a one [[ORDINAL]] delay & ‚Äú ahh , ohh ‚Äù in between each letter . just like the voice over does n‚Äôt match lips
excellent feat . congratulations [[GPE]] .
funny thing was they actually saw [[PERSON]] ‚Äôs email server on its surface .
