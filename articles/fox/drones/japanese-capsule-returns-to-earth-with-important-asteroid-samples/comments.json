And the heat produced during the impact and the ejection into space would have boiled the lighter elements off while the rest of the material would have mixed.\nSo if the difference is that the moon has less iron and less of the lighter elements such as hydrogen, the only water would be that that fell from comets.   It also has low gravity and next to no atmosphere, so surface water would sublimate into space unless hidden at the poles in shade.  The same lack of atmosphere results in extreme temperature variations and high radiation issues.\n\nOr so the story goes....",
