US and Russia both built intelligent defense control systems, the US version was called Colossus (don’t remember the Russian system’s name) anyway the two machines discovered each other, exchanged information by forcing both countries to grant communications access, then decided that humans needed a caretaker.  I tend to agree that we need to tread very carefully when contemplating giving intelligence and reasoning skills to a machine that can think thousands of times faster than we can.  That is not a wise move.",
