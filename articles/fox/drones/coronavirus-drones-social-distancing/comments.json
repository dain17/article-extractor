There is a virus out there and people are getting sick and some are dying but the whole thing as to how deadly it is has been a big lye. There are experts that have credentials as good or better that Fauchi that have already stated that this house arrest that the entire country has been put on was the wrong thing to do. We should have just protected the most at risk people and let everyone else go on normally and we would have built a herd immunity. All we have done with the house arrest is to prolong how long it will take for people to become sick and in some cases die. They have shown that either way house arrest or no house arrest while protecting the most at risk people will lead to roughly the same amount of people dying. The thing with no house arrest is that we would not have put most of America out of work and totally crashed our economy.",
