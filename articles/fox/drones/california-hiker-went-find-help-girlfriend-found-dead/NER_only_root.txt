sorry this guy is dead , but he and the girlfriend should have been better prepared if they were going hiking in soaring temperatures . on top of that , they put the responders lives at risk too .
yeah , let 's go hiking when it 's [[QUANTITY]] outside . other than that , [[ORG]] .
people do n't realize that water is paramount when hiking or doing anything outside in high temperatures . the southwest is nothing like the [[LOC]] . it is a scorching desert , mainly .
i would n't even go outside & mow the lawn if the heat index was [[CARDINAL]] , let alone go hiking around in the hills .
very sad ! ! !
it 's the girlfriends fault he is dead , hope she can live with herself .
i do n't think it is a coincidence that [[GPE]] was under a heat dome . god was just trying to get rid of some [[NORP]] bedbugs .
[[PERSON]] strikes again !
this is sadly not the [[ORDINAL]] nor the last time this will occur . i once had an heated discussion with a father of [[CARDINAL]] and his wife in a parking lot at rmnp . they were leaving the trailhead for a hike at 2pm on [[DATE]] . [[PERSON]] , sneakers , no backpacks no water , no food . i asked them where they were headed - ypsilon lake , [[QUANTITY]] hike at high altitude . i offered to give him my extra water and food , repeatedly but he refused . i advised against being in the mountains when electrical storms are likely . i also mentioned that my nephew and i had just come from there and we had started out at at [[TIME]] . they left . do n't minimize the danger of wilderness . there is no doordash , there is no uber this is not a disney movie . bad things can happen even if you are prepared .
and yet he will still vote [[NORP]] come [[DATE]] .
it would n't matter if i had water in that setting . [[QUANTITY]] heat would do me in before dehydration hit . they probably had nothing on their heads and clearly no water .
some people just end up being a warning to everyone else . this was all preventable . if nothing else , the 110 + temperatures should have been a huge warning sign to stay in where it 's cool and airconditioned ...
a degree in statistics ... and he could n't calculate his chances of survival hiking at over [[MONEY]] ... that company may be glad they have lost this statistician ...
all these hiking and dying stories have convinced me to stay near the truck and beer cooler ...
i 'm a thru hiker with [[QUANTITY]] of mountains under my belt and i always cringe when i hear of day hikers getting in trouble .
i thought that [[LOC]] was under a heat warning [[DATE]] ? it is kind of shocking they did not over prepare for that . sad .
why would you ever go hiking on a [[QUANTITY]] day ?
lame search effort . if he was a white girl it would have been [[CARDINAL]] times bigger
that was gallant of him . unwise to be out hiking in that kind of heat to start with , though .
" the temperature in the area had soared to [[QUANTITY]] ... " in case you do n't know , that is dangerous heat to be hiking in if you 're not prepared . it takes more then two bottles of water and a [[ORG]] bar . my wife and i went camping / hiking at [[DATE]] in [[GPE]] and , [[PERCENT]] of my back pack was nothing but water . be prepared .
a small roll of reflective duct tape has many uses in a pack , including marking where you are going , and where you have been . after hiking in [[PERSON]] in [[CARDINAL]] heat and seeing day hikers out without pack , water or a hat , these stories do n't surprise me anymore .
this is a sad outcome , he graduated with a degree in [[ORG]] and did n't have the sense to plan his hike accordingly . i 'm sorry for the family and friends loss , getting over this is n't a good statistic either ! .
bet that 's hanging over her head and for the rest of her life by not going with him .
apparently he did n't factor in the ' statistic ' that hiking without water could lead to death .
pretty tragic , and it could 've had a better ending .
confucius say he who studies statistics may [[DATE]] become one .
[[PERSON]] was obviously a nice guy . this is a terrible tragedy .
but , but , but ... they took a hiking course at [[ORG]] .
i love adventure as much as anyone , but hiking in the triple digit heat without supplies was not a great idea . this could have ended even worse , they could have both died . sorry for his family ...
i 've seen others comment on what he should 've done . they 're all survivalist . now i 'm a survivalist because i read their comments . i 'm going for a hike in [[GPE]] . i 'll be back .
often better to stick together and stay put rather than expending energy aimlessly walking around . also if they are looking for you , thermal imaging shows up better on the cooler temps of [[TIME]] .
iphone [[CARDINAL]] ..
statistically his odds were better just staying with her than going off on his own looking for help . i see he studied statistics in college ‚Äî go figure .
if you plan on doing much hiking in back country where there is no cell service the at least but a satellite communicator . also be aware that the elements in many places are more deadly than most wild animals
i have hiked [[LOC]] . most people are n't prepared for the quantity of water that must be carried .
cause of death : weak girlfriend on hike .
this happens [[DATE]] . person goes on a hike without water and succumbs to the heat . camel packs and canteens are available in every store that caters to hiking . out west , especially states like [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and also southern [[GPE]] if you go hiking without water during the summer you are just asking for trouble .
failing to prepare even for the most minor of walks or hikes is preparing your funeral . nature is unforgiving and does n‚Äôt care who you are . [[ORDINAL]] rule of survival though is never split up . [[PERCENT]] of the survival situations the person who said ‚Äú let me go get help ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù is often the [[ORDINAL]] victim . best thing is to stay put . wait for rescue .
it 's easy to get turned around even on a trail . you should stop every so often and look back down the path if you have to backtrack . paths can look different when going in the opposite direction you 've been going . there can be a fork that you did n't notice .
and the prize goes to [[PERSON]]
no hiking if +100 degree temps are expected .
he was close to water too , [[QUANTITY]] or 2 from where he died , there were creeks to the north , the west , and the east , but if he was going south west nothing .
was he [[NORP]] ? ?
great guy , but going out in the wilderness is not like going to your local park with swing sets . you must be prepared both with supplies ( [[QUANTITY]] water , compass , fire starter , clothes ) and physically prepared with lots of strength and endurance training
my condolences to his family and friends
they go hiking in [[QUANTITY]] heat and do n‚Äôt bring any water ?
death comes to us all . i hope this young man had a life well lived . may his next life be even better .
never go hiking with out twice the water you need
prayers for his family and friends .
you have to have a thought - out plan if you 're going to go skipping in the triple digit heat .
up until running out of water , was it fun hiking in [[QUANTITY]] heat ?
you gen z folks just stay right where you are .
i have got a brother who is a software engineer , very well respected in his field , but does n‚Äôt know what end of the nail to drive .
[[DATE]] , that 's all it takes , [[DATE]] without water and you 're dead .
always take at least twice the amount of water that you think that you need . and always be on the way back when you use [[CARDINAL]] of your water . this way you will have a reserve . marking your starting point with a gps is a great idea . letting someone know where you are going and when you will be back saves lives .
they had an ‚Äú osprey ‚Äù looking for this guy ?
[[ORG]] . this happens when you do not know what you are doing .
women always outlive the men .
godspeed , young man
reminds me of the case of the family in ca which died due to heat . husband , wife , infant and dog . he too was a google engineer if i recall correctly . sad state of affairs just like this one but at least their was a survior in this case .
hiking in [[QUANTITY]] ? why would someone do this to themselves ?
some help he was , she should ‚Äôve said thanks but no thanks
seems like this happens a lot lately .
he took a nice stroll on the [[PERSON]] trail ....
graduated from the university of [[GPE]] ? statistics ? oh well he did n‚Äôt know the temperature was in triple digits üòÇ not sure how he got degree in statistics üòÇ
there is a reason why they never film seasons of alone or survivor in [[GPE]] - because no one would .
she is in trouble , he leaves her to get help for her , he ends up dead and she gets rescued . what is that ? how did she get rescued ?
darwinism at work .
sad . such a bright young man with his whole life ahead of him .
software engineers should stay out of the wilderness .
[[PERSON]] wins again .
hmmm ... smart enough to be a software engineer but not smart enough to not hike in a heatwave . something is missing here ... oh , that 's right ... common sense ! sorry to see he lost his life from this lack . probably knew plenty about diversity and equity though .
[[ORG]] , they did not even check the weather forecast for [[DATE]] before hiking . how smart was that . rip and condolence to the family .
hint , you do not go hiking in the wilderness in [[QUANTITY]] heat . i am beginning to wonder what ‚Äú college ‚Äù teaches these young people .
very sad , easily avoided . drink [[CARDINAL]] quart of water per hour of exercise in [[CARDINAL]] deg heat . if you do n't want to carry all that weight , do n't go !
the confidence of youth . older , wiser people would n't be hiking in temps like that .
this nice , young dies trying to help someone , and [[PERSON]] lives to terrorize and murder innocent victims .
his statistics degree should have helped him realize that staying on the trail would increase his odds of rescue and survival . also , hiking in an arid region during a [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] heat wave is not recommended . always carry plenty of water , a topographical map , and a lensatic compass .
be prepared - is what we learned in boy scouts and it has stayed with me to this day - i hike a lot in the mountains of [[GPE]] - my pack has lots of things i hope i wo n‚Äôt need but just in case i carry an extra [[CARDINAL]] - 7 lbs if gear - water is so critical i always over do it - and have returns to my car with [[CARDINAL]] of the water not used - causes me pain to hear these stories - i may one day die in the mountains as well but until that day i will prepare as best i can .
his girlfriend should be mine now üòÇ
so , [[PERSON]] wins again .
in [[DATE]] , [[GPE]] graduated from [[ORG]] , where he studied statistics . i guess he did n't know the statistics about dying of heat exhaustion when hiking in over [[QUANTITY]] heat with no / little water .
out of towner 's regularly do this in [[GPE]] . we have [[DATE]] deaths . sadly even doctors and [[CARDINAL]] with a [[DATE]] just died doing this same thing [[DATE]] . it literally happens all the time here .
why do this in the heat ? and you ‚Äôre not prepared ? sad . rip . his blue eyes are beautiful . my condolences too his family .
you have [[DATE]] at best in the desert to survive with no water . find shade in the daytime and rest . search dig for water in the mornings and [[TIME]] . do n't believe the myth a barrel cactus can give u water .
i do n't understand why they would go hiking in [[QUANTITY]] heat .
he should ‚Äôve watched [[CARDINAL]] episode of [[PERSON]] ! he would still be alive to personally thank [[PERSON]] .
the girlfriend did it .
smart enough to be a software engineer but not smart enough to pack enough water for their hike !
ironically he ‚Äôs now a statistic .
[[DATE]] another high tech guy died after running out of gas in a mountain road in the middle of the [[DATE]] . lots of firewood around , but .... no food , no matches , with his wife and kids . when they ran out of car battery , he went out looking for help , but died of hypothermia . rescuers found his family and saved them .
[[ORG]] engineer [[ORG]] 'll teach you to hate [[ORG]] , they 'll teach you technology , but they ca n't teach you common sense .
you ‚Äôd think that since he studied statistics , he would have been a little more careful about not becoming one .
i ‚Äôll bet she wanted to get some cool content for her followers
another reason why men are worth [[MONEY]] more an hour . we go get you water in [[QUANTITY]] heat if your parched and we will let you float on the entire door by yourself after the cruise liner sinks as we float into the abyss and help is only seconds away .
a [[GPE]] hiker was found dead [[DATE]] after leaving his girlfriend on a trail to find her water in the mountains of [[GPE]] , authorities said . " sady , most of these type hikers do not take any water with them when hiking .
you got to be prepared . have plenty of supplies and always track your location . prayers to the family
such a shame . it 's diffucult to know what to do in those situations when water might be available just over that next hill - i get it . the dry heat pulls the water out of you with every breath . i got myself stuck in the flour - like sand of the [[PERSON]] [[QUANTITY]] from the nearest paved road and spent [[TIME]] alone in [[DATE]] temps . you want to start walking out but i rememberd the mantra " always stay with your vehicle " which saved me when a railway employee spotted it while staging a repair in the only remote rail - yard in the basin . lucky beyong belief . wish this young man could have shared in that luck .
with that heat wave going on in [[GPE]] , why do people go hiking in places where they are far away from any help or civilization ? it makes no sense to me . stay home .... go to the beach . go sit by the pool . save the hiking for the cooler weather , for [[ORG]] 's sake .
i do n't know if eventual improved cell service in the dessert through satellite or whatever will be a good thing or bad thing . probably mostly good but it 's going to give some people a false sense of security because nothing is [[PERCENT]] reliable . i would n't go to far in without a epirb .
very sad but very dumb ! this fellow may have been book smart but was a dud at outdoor prep and planning . should never have been in very hot canyons in that sort of conditions ! condolences to his family and hope this incident is a lesson to other people about the dangers of outdoor activity poorly planned in a heat wave !
of course this a horrible tragedy . brave young man wanted to save his gf and wound up dead himself . what a cruel sacrifice . i do n't live in a climate anywhere near like they were in but as an avid hiker , i always have a camelbak filled to the top .
[[PERSON]] protecting the species .
[[ORG]] hike during the worst heatwave in [[DATE]] ... unless you want to test fate .
what is wrong with our youth ? they seem to able to get through college but have not [[CARDINAL]] lick of common sense . hey let ‚Äôs go hiking in the desert , should we bring lots of water , should we have a map or some way to get help ? is their a / c out there . i ‚Äôm not sure . i almost sure they were not [[NORP]] .
too hot for hiking and [[GPE]] is too damaged by left wing dogma to turn on your air conditioner or even charge your [[ORG]] thanks to bad governing by [[NORP]] , once again .
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] " is neither kind nor merciful ; she is coldly indifferent . [[ORG]] , software engineers , and urban financial managers need to understand that , and deal with her on her terms before they venture into her realm , and prepare accordingly , because she wo n't help them or save them if they do n't .
this is tragic , but what compels people to hike in such extreme temperatures ? just because it 's there should n't cloud one 's judgment as to whether it 's safe or not .
lemme guess -- they each had one water bottle .
mild heat exhaustion ? and she 's still with us ? odd , and something terrible to live with if no foul play .
glad she was saved but his is so tragic . condolences to the family !
[[CARDINAL]] ? yeah , let ‚Äôs go hiking , let ‚Äôs not bring enough water either and be sure not to hyper hydrated before we go . [[CARDINAL]] ! air conditioned home , air conditioned office , air conditioned car , and then he stepped out of his car at a temperature that he should n‚Äôt have exposed himself to for [[TIME]] .
heat is unforgiving no matter how old you are . so sorry for the family .
will this be an episode of [[ORG]] : how to survive with creek stewart ?
horrible never leave the area where you ‚Äôre stranded
each person should have had a thermo jug of cold water .
[[QUANTITY]] , and they chose a mountain trail over a day at the beach ? ! smh !
why do people go hiking in the 110 - 120 degree heat and not take enough water with them ?
i carry enough gear on a day hike to survive easily for [[TIME]] . i carry a map and compass , [[DATE]] of water and a water straw to purify water from any source .
he should have taken geography instead . probably his idea to take them hiking too . a ) if you or your girlfriend ca n't make it , you probably should n't go . b ) remember where you 're going so you know how to make it back . c ) worrying about water or thinking you have to have it slows you down . d ) take breaks , reconnect your thoughts and bearings . e ) keep a bandana around your neck . f ) if you die , it 's because you only failed yourself . that 's no excuse . g ) your body is set up to do miraculous things , do n't undercut yourself .
he looks quite regarded .
when the temperature is above [[CARDINAL]] even the cactus can get dehydrated .
[[PERSON]] candidates ? the girl friend must be having guilt problems .
[[CARDINAL]] intelligent young people hiking in extreme heat without sufficient water . i thought everyone knew not to do that , but they must have been liberals as they do n't have any common sense . better than taking enough water , just stay home in that kind of heat as sufficient water will not be enough when hiking in [[QUANTITY]] heat to stay out of heat exhaustion and possibly heat stroke .
where is your god now ?
who but the middle class can afford the up keep on [[CARDINAL]] of these
so very sad for the parents .
he studied statistics there 's a better than [[PERCENT]] chance a group of [[CARDINAL]] random people will have [[CARDINAL]] with the same birthday .
tragedy but what is real sad are the post on this young [[NORP]] death .
people in [[GPE]] do n't have common sense , look at the governor , it is quite obvious .
natural selection at work .
[[ORG]]
software engineers know nothing about real engineering , like water needs in desert conditions . there is an old [[ORG]] field engineering manual which can help in these calculations .
so sorry this young man died . young people not a worry in the world , think they will live forever . at times that is an enviable quality . but we 're into [[DATE]] , typically the highest temps of [[DATE]] . extreme heat warnings [[DATE]] . not something to take lightly or ignore . then heading out without enough water . very sad .
his boss looks at the bright side . he can replace this $ [[MONEY]] / year dude with some [[PRODUCT]] dude from [[GPE]] for $ [[MONEY]]
ironic he studied statistics ... now he is one .
how do you go on a day hike and not carry enough water ? . [[DATE]] per person
nobody in [[GPE]] fares well . but seriously do n‚Äôt people learn from the news the dangers of hiking in that kind of heat with so many reported deaths ? common sense is gone with the i can go wherever attitude of people [[DATE]] . sad ending for such a young man .
he was a simp . girlfriend told him to go hiking and he goes and gf tells him to go fetch water and he does it
" we 'll be ok . i often go into grizzly country with an empty big bore revolver . "
he died a hero . [[ORG]] üèº
he likely had dirt on the clintons .
.... now here was a true man and hero ... died worrying about someone else ...
i 've hiked in the desert in [[DATE]] , which is still [[DATE]] . we had lots of water ! i drank 3 quarts of water that morning before i started the hike . i had [[QUANTITY]] more to get me thru [[DATE]] . we also let the park rangers know where we were hiking and at what time we expected to be back . hiking in extreme conditions can be a cherished memory , or it can be your doom . please prepare properly so that it is the former .
come on man , the way y' all are lollygagging around here with them cellphones and liberal arts degrees like it 's a [[QUANTITY]] ! ca n't be [[CARDINAL]] ! note to self ... carry extra water always ... girlfriend small enough to carry might help .
who did he think he was ... [[PERSON]] griswold ... ?
‚òù üòÄ why did n't they spend [[DATE]] at [[ORG]] instead ? he studied statistics and now he is a statistic .
‚Äú studied statistics ‚Äù . then he became one . ü§∑ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è
i think many of us , let 's say older folks can remember being in our [[CARDINAL]] 's and even 30 's where you still have that feeling of invincibility . with age comes wisdom . god bless all involved .
the world ; the earth ; is not user friendly .
how many women die trying to save their boyfriends ? [[CARDINAL]] .
most [[ORG]] would have taken a 12 oz bottle of water with them .
very sad indeed , but common sense would have helped prevent this ... don't go out into the desert in [[DATE]] and [[DATE]] , hike somewhere else . hiked and camped in the deserts of [[GPE]] and no one in their right mind would go into the desert areas from [[DATE]] till [[DATE]] and if you do , have lots of water and let people know where you will be .
[[PERSON]] that 's sad ; - (
those techie types maybe hot stuff in [[LOC]] but they are vulture bait in the real ones . kind of symbolic when it comes to their liberal ideology .
sad story . may the young man rest in peace .
" temperature in the area had soared to [[QUANTITY]] " and they thought it was a good time for a hike ? common sense is a thing of the past .
[[ORG]]
we ve had [[DATE]] of [[QUANTITY]] sun the [[ORDINAL]] being highest hit [[CARDINAL]] in [[GPE]] so i can imagine how hot it would ‚Äôve been hiking in the mountains [[QUANTITY]] is not high enough to get cold it really is a shame ca n‚Äôt underestimate the heat
going for help would have been reaching into the pack and pulling out a quart of water .
a personal locator beacon would be a good idea when hiking in unfamiliar areas where you could get lost .
he picked the wrong girlfriend .
[[ORG]] and scholar , very brave . hopefully others will learn from this , hiking has many dangers .
dear city folks- if you want to experience nature , stick to your dog parks and potted plants . leave the real hiking to real people that know better .
he got back to nature forever ..... stay out of nature you do not belong there ! ! !
she apparently stated at a holiday [[ORG]] the night before .
if you 're going to hike in [[QUANTITY]] , bring water .
the important question , did she get the selfies she needed for her social pages ?
attention [[GPE]] [[NORP]] ! if you 're planning a nature expedition : buy a good quality compass , learn how to use it and carry it with you . fyi : the wilderness does n't have cell phone chargers . remembering the sun rises in the east and sets in the west may also be helpful . as well as being able to locate [[PERSON]] in the night sky and knowing which side of a tree moss grows on .
if planning to hike in the wilderness , please consider [[ORDINAL]] getting a [[NORP]] amateur radio license and taking a handy talkie ( ht ) programmed with local repeater and national calling frequencies . doing so is an excellent safety net against cell phones not working in the area , since it 's highly likely that the ht can connect to a repeater for emergency help .
there should be a wilderness training course for nerds , there 's just some places they have no business being .
software engineer but lost his way - too focused on ‚Äú saving his gf ‚Äù . a pure shame üòû üòû üòû üòû üòû üòû üòû üòû üòû
those who believe the couple should have known about the effects of heat need to realize they were schooled in [[GPE]] ..........
[[CARDINAL]] ......... yeah let 's go for a hike ................... smfh ........... thanks [[PERSON]]
go hiking in very hot weather out in the sun taking no water . one has to wonder at the quality of his software if he could make that many mistakes including hiking around in the hot sun off trail looking for water . the girl friend recovered and or somebody found her on the trail which means if he had simply stayed on trail and gone back to the trail head the story would be a lot different .
a survival blanket and water . do n't leave home without them .
i agreed to marriage without having consumed enough alcohol . i 'm barely surviving at this point .
wow , truly tragic .
statistics ? he should have never been hiking
studied " statistics " i wonder what the statistics say about surviving a unprepared hike in the desert ? especially when your hiking partner has " mild heat exhaustion " ? she whined , he played hero and died trying to " be a a man " software engineer .
it is a strong indicator of just how much coarser modern [[GPE]] has become that the negative , blaming , ' holier - than - thou ' comments outnumber those that have a sense of grace and sorrow over the death of someone who , while admittedly making an error in judgement -- perhaps made more grievous by already being affected by dehydration and heat exhaustion -- at least attempted to save the life of a loved one , and died trying . i especially enjoy the lectures . i 'm sure that the vast majority of would - be desert hikers consult [[ORG]] ' comments before venturing out . . .
[[QUANTITY]] of water weighs [[CARDINAL]] and even that is not enough water for one person to be hiking up in the hills in [[QUANTITY]] heat . but what do i know , i ai n't no fancy software engineer .
need water , sure , there must be an app for that ....
city dwellers . once they get off the pavement they are in danger . [[QUANTITY]] and he carried no water for them ? he certainly tried to help her as long as there was life in his body , i respect him for that .
who needs to bring stinkin ' water ... mommy nature will provide . she gave us weed , right ?
you would think that a smart guy like him would have better chances of survival than the rest of us
[[PERSON]] . sad result .
it 's hard to imagine people hiking in the ca heat wave without an ample supply of water . it 's not that hard to fill up a back pack with bottles of water . other items would also help the body to retain water . it 's just too bad these [[CARDINAL]] were not experienced enough and unprepared to take that hike .
hey , it ‚Äôs [[QUANTITY]] . i got an idea , let ‚Äôs go hiking .
[[ORG]] solvers asked if there was a black man around .
[[PERSON]] wins again . hiking in [[QUANTITY]] , brillant ....
a good tip . once your water bottle hits the halfway point , turn around and hike back to your starting point .
what a sad story . his family and friends will likely be heart broken . he seems like an upstanding young man . he went to get help for his girlfriend , and sadly succumbed to the conditions , himself . they were young and miscalculated . condolences to his family . may he rest in eternal peace .
besides choosing a personal pronoun , or your gender , maybe we should demand courses in common sense , nature and survival be passed before high school graduation ?
it 's usually the one who goes to find help who dies .........
what did he know about the [[PERSON]]
tax payers should be reimbursed for these rescues . hikers should at least make a deposit for these services .
for [[MONEY]] you can purchase a device like [[PRODUCT]] - way satellite messenger , activate it for $ [[MONEY]] a month , and help is just a push button away ... as far as accident , or stupidity insurance it 's a pretty good deal , especially compared to the cost of a rescue or death ...
who helps the helper to get help ?
so many people from the [[LOC]] unprepared to tackle the open trails , flooding in canyons and climbing mountains in the west . exceptions seem to be [[ORG]] hikers who know what they 're doing most of the time .
when water is [[CARDINAL]] gone , you turn back . hiking [[CARDINAL]] .
[[ORG]]
when the heat is in the triple digits , do n't go hiking ! i have a hard time just getting into my car when it 's that hot . just use some common sense and do n't do it .
not a brilliant decision to go hiking in this weather , but i hope his family finds comfort in knowing he was a stand - up guy ... those are few and far between [[DATE]] , especially here in ca .
this was a college graduate . what is university of [[GPE]] teaching . wake up people , you are responsible for yourself . you have to be smarter than the brown stuff on the bottom of your shoe
so sad .
" heat is likely a contributing factor . " thank you captain [[PERSON]] .
that 's what get 's me . did they not see the weather forecast ? it had been hot and forecast to get hotter . i would n't have went out , but if i did , surely i 'd had all kindsa water ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
[[ORG]] and surviving out in nature normally do n't mix .
i arrogantly went on a bicycle race in hot weather with little water and it almost took me out . learned that lesson the hard way , too bad about this kid and his gf not learning it in time .
special thanks to the howling coyotes and circling birds in finding the body . it 's what they do , it 's all they do .
[[DATE]] went " elk " hunting with a friend . i went to go get the jeep , while he " field dressed " the animal . i walked for [[CARDINAL]] minutes to where i thought we had left the [[ORG]] . as i was walking , i came upon another hunter . was i surprised when it turned out to be my friend . i had walked back in a circle without realizing it . somebody once told me , if you walk on unfamiliar ground long enough , your dominate foot ( left or right ) will cause you to do that - walk in a circle . btw - when i got back to where he was , he asked - " [[WORK_OF_ART]] ? "
sad , people do n't realize how fast heat can kill you .
growing up in the mountains of [[GPE]] i have seen too many people take mother nature for granted . be prepared . she can be a mean b !
lets go hiking‚Ä¶.its gon na be [[CARDINAL]] ¬∞ and we got no water ?
pay attention to conditions and do n't go off alone if you have no clue what you are doing . nature is n't forgiving . there are no participation trophies when it comes to this stuff . it 's live or die in the wild .
[[PERSON]] did that .
he was from [[GPE]] and still not smart enough to be prepared to hike in the heat ? he became a statistic for the clueless greens .
let go hiking its [[CARDINAL]] [[DATE]] . do n't worry the state has drinking fountains along the way ! we will be fine .
so let 's go hiking in [[DATE]] in the desert with limited water in [[QUANTITY]] heat ... then .. go way deep in the desert .. run out of water .. let boyfriend leave .. then whip out your cell phone and get rescued ? ummm alrighty then .
here is a fact , ‚Äú can you hear me now ‚Äù is a thing in most desert environments . no tmobile , [[ORG]] or [[ORG]] will work when you need it . most people can walk a mile in no time , but the [[ORDINAL]] mile is n‚Äôt that fast because heat will dehydrate you and your brain needs lots of water to operate . desperation and fear will drain more water and diminish brain activity faster . heat stroke ? heat exhaustion ? death , so drink water [[DATE]] before and take extra water
very smart- warnings all over [[LOC]] about dangerous heat . with heat waves like that often come wildfires that you are not outrunning . let 's go hiking ...
