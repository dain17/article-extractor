I'm leaving on a Wyoming \"elk\" hunt in October and really want to make sure my grammar is in place to tell the story when I get back. \nThat is, unless those quotation marks suggest you weren't really \"elk hunting\" as you suggest. Maybe you and your buddy were up to something else that would cause you to put elk in quotations? \nDid either of you at any time say something like \"I cant quit you?\" \nIf you did, that's cool. No reason to cover it up by calling it \"elk\" hunting. ",

I also mentioned that my nephew and I had just come from there and we had started out at at 7am. They left. \nDon't minimize the danger of wilderness.
