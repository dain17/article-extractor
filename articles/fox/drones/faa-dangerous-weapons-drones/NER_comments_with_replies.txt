something else , when i was a kid , this would be considered normal fun . oh no , visit from [[ORG]] is coming .
i certainly hope that the terrorists have read this , now we do n't have to worry right ? after all they follow all the gun laws , right ?
fix the [[ORG]] issue not the tool alone .
oh my ! now we 're sure to be [[PERCENT]] safe from drone based weapons based terrorism , death , and carnage . i feel so relieved . not ! { o.o }
as long as we keep them above the ' hood they are doing a great service to [[GPE]]
hmmm , is our government getting a little scared that the citizens might have discovered a way to have aerial coverage when tshtf
the [[ORG]] can not make law . so it is not illegal . the [[ORG]] does not have [[ORG]] to make laws . they can spout their rule all they want . it is not law .
human beings are are going to do what human beings do , and you ca n't put the toothpaste back in the tube . we were kicked out of paradise because of our need for more and propensity to listen to the devil more than god , even when we all ready have more than we need .
terrorists ( and antiphags ) do not follow the law . so this regulation only applies to law abiding citizens .
all laws only apply to law abiding citizens .
hmmm , wonder what individuals are charged with when they are caught . since the laws obviously do n't apply to them they ca n't be jailed for breaking those laws ( at least according to you ) .
really that ’s what you got from what i said ? wow only law abiding citizens follow the law , others are behaving criminally and can be charged under the law .
your exact words " all laws only apply to law abiding citizens " . based on that statement you must believe that those laws do n't apply to criminals and thus they ca n't be used to charge criminals .
yeah , and sick people are n't supposed to get their hands on [[ORG]] 's either .
heck , when i was a kid we used to tape bottle rockets to paper airplanes to make paper jets . they went up , blew up and came down in flames .
cool !
you had to put the rocket near the middle & hand launch them . [[ORG]] error . cheap enough fun .
ah the good old [[DATE]] of fun !
most of the stuff that my brothers and i did for fun back in [[DATE]] would get kids arrested [[DATE]] .
the guvmint could have weaponized drones airborne in conus at the drop of a hat .
faa- ever heard of the highly effective cruise missile , pilotless fighter jets , [[ORG]] ?
i started helping a friend of mine develop a system to use drones for crop spraying , but he had to stop when he found out that if he were to use drone commercially , he had to have pilot 's licence . even with a pre - programmed flight plan ( with some serious safety systems in place ) , the fact that it was commercial operation meant that the person operating or responsible for the flying of the drone had to have a pilot 's licence . i think that the [[ORG]] is terrified of drones .
it 's more of the fact that the drone will be potentially be operating in the same airspace as airplanes with real people in them . pre - programmed can be more dangerous than active control simply because of unexpected occurrences ( property next to his is being crop dusted , life flight landing near his property for some reason , etc ) .
in the case of what we 're were doing , the net operational elevation was [[CARDINAL]] ' above the crops . at some point there has to be some measure of common sense applied . we were developing a system that would have reduced the amount of pesticide / herbicide / fertilizer needed by using a very highly specific application instead of the massive over - spraying that most aerial application techniques create . it would have eliminated the need for leaving empty rows for tractor based spraying , which would have increased yield per acre . it would have been far cheaper than crop dusters as well .
then get a remote pilot certificate . they are fairly easy to obtain and require absolutely no class time or demonstration of skills . all you need to do is show you can pass a test which basically only shows you understand the rules you are operating the drone within .
it 's ridiculously expensive for its ' purpose ( $ [[MONEY]] per 2 years , just for ' working ' with a rc toy ) ; and though it 's nice to know how to read sectional charts , metars , and other flying details , it 's unnecessary for simple operation of a microprocessor - controlled drone .
lol , ' working ' with a rc toy . drones can be light and they can be big and heavy . i 've seen " rc toys " just about kill someone before ( back before the days they were called drones , an operator lost control of a racing rc plane and it went into the crowd . the prop chewed the guy up way more than i would have ever thought possible for an rc plane . these toys can kill , especially the larger ones .
i doubt airplanes are going to be flying in the same airspace as a drone crop duster , if they are , they are probably already crashing
drones can fly [[CARDINAL]] [[CARDINAL]] ' legally . life flight helicopters routinely fly that low to the ground when near the point of landing . crop dusters also are easily within that same elevation . so yes , there will be aircraft at the same elevations as drones . that is the reason for the current [[ORG]] flight rules for drones and part of the reason that any commercial operation requires remote pilot certificate . that is not the same as a pilot license .
i wonder if the military was informed of this ?
pepper spray , itching powder , tear gas will soon be used to disperse unruly crowds . like at soccer games .
there is definitely a place for drone ammo . rc aircraft with [[ORG]] bullets . rc aerial battles .
[[PERSON]] invented the drone .
[[PERSON]] loves to drone on and on and on ...
oh you beat me to it .
i think he invented radio waves
a drone and all rc flying toys are dangerous weapons ! " dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury .
i have a dji mavic air , and unless you get hit in the eye by a propeller , your not going to cause more than a few small cuts on your hands etc if hit by it .
could you fly it into someone head at full speed ? guess what it can be used that way . what if it goes out of control from getting moisture in it negating it 's safety features and it hits someone ? [[PERSON]] 's [[PERSON]] comes into play !
you mean like a table fork and an automobile ?
the government says , do n't do as i do , just do as i say .
the government has nukes do you want one too ?
why not ?
" ' dangerous weapons ' are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . " if misused , the drone , itself , can be used for or be able to cause death or serious bodily injury . so can a car . so can a lighter . so can a butter knife . so can a pencil . so can a thought . they all can be " weapons " , as defined by the [[ORG]] . thinking about it can [[ORG]] !
well then , make a place for them !
personally , a roman candle on one side would be fun .
this is a direct result of the viral [[ORDINAL]] of [[DATE]] roman candle drone video ...
the only people who are shaking in their boots now are the folks who would never arm a drone . :(
from above , " " dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . " a drone , all by itself , flying at maximum speed can do the above . so obviously the [[ORG]] has n't thought this through .
of course not . they are government agency .
most pilots of [[ORG]] ( drone ) are responsible pilots who use the craft as either a camera platform , or a r / c aircraft for sport flying . the focal length of the lens is con conducive to spying on individuals . as with any device , they can and are miss used .
i 'm waiting for [[ORG]] 's opinion on this before i give up my bomb carrying drown .
a see a new profession on the horizon , a drone hunter
it 's my [[ORDINAL]] amendment right to attach dangerous weapons to my drone .
anyone ever see those cool drones that fly over other drones and drop a bunch of shoe laces into the propellers ?
what if the gun on our drone is [[GPE]] ? sanctuary policies come into play
do n't tell [[ORG]] that !
the [[ORG]] thinks this warning will prevent anyone weaponizing a drone . it just gave many the idea . thanks .
so true . [[PERCENT]] of the population never even thought of it . now many will .
government should have thought about that before approving them for civilian use . humans are creative and not always in a good way . anything that can be weaponized will be . if it can be used to commit murder it will be . welcome to [[DATE]] .
these inappropriately named drones were around long before the government ever became involved . it might interest you to know that [[ORG]] has [[ORG]] forbidden the attachment of pyrotechnic devices to model aircraft in the interest of safety .
[[NORP]] guys laugh at [[ORG]] rules .
we 're also free men who do n't require the governments permission to live .
you 're right . but you ca n't walk the streets with a bazooka on your shoulder .
cameras are the most dangerous things mounted on drones .
depending if you are female sunbathing naked in the backyard ....
unless they 're over [[GPE]]
there goes my weekend activitiies
lol . so only the criminal / terrorist at heart will do this . what law abiding citizen would attach a bomb to a drone ?
unless they are being flown in public or residential areas , the government does not have compelling interest in infringing on our right to attach weapons to drones . however ridiculous doing so may be .
a foot above your property is [[ORG]] airspace ... look it up ... they have right to every ounce of airspace ... according to the law .
aw shucks , i guess i have to dismantle my double [[PRODUCT]] drone .
it may sound like a ' [[PERSON]] ' to you but , during a filming of a [[GPE]] show about a gun shop . there was a segment about them equipping a ' drone ' with a remotely operated semi automatic hand gun and a ' first person ' video aiming system . very illegal
drone hunting trip to the high plains has been canceled .
whaaaaat ? no guns , bombs or fireworks allowed on drones anymore ? well ok , l guess we 'll just have to switch to bags full of gasoline , acid and medical waste then .... or maybe the [[ORG]] classic children 's toys ? " bag - o - nails , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] " ! [[PERSON]]
i think the police should definitely support the development of armed drone technology , to reach and neutralize mass shooters faster and safer .
i 'm sure the police is excluded from this law .
if the word illegal means nothing to the dims when discussing immigration - why does illegal matter in other situations ?
you seem to be a little [[WORK_OF_ART]]
to you maybe - but setting up lawlessness results in more lawlessness and begins precedence . you do nt get to pick and choose - you follow the law
not really . once that barrier is broken , what else matters ?
its my drone ... launched from my land .... flying over my land ... with legally purchased " attachments " .. the [[ORG]] does nt allow inventors to experiment ? and if they " buzz " me with their drone trying to spy on me .. is nt that trespassing in my airspace ? ..
your airspace ends about a foot off the ground ... other than that [[ORG]] owns it .
my drone identifies as a holster , so get bent .
ok point taken . do not strap an abortion doctor to your drone .
the militias are exempt . the [[ORG]] ca nt regulate the militia . the government ca nt stand competition .
" dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . ... so let this be a lesson : do n't strap a liberal to your drone .
did n't say anything about missiles .
is it ok if i have a gun free zone sticker on my drone ? what if the gun chose to stow away on its own without my knowledge , as guns are prone to act out on their own ?
they can have whatever law they want . a criminal is not required to follow the law .
i 'm a licensed drone operator . it really does n't take a whole lot of common sense to know that you should n't equip your drone with lethal gadgets . but then again , it 's the [[ORG]] and we live in a nanny state .
you have n't been on youtube lately ... many videos of hand guns strapped to drones .
flame throwers are legal in my state ...
[[NORP]] of killjoys .
drones will be the deliverer of the next attack .
i am ok with this one . i do n't think my neighbor should be able to fly a drone over my property with a weapon on it . i do n't see it as infringement on [[DATE]] . i carry , my weapon is on my person , not flying [[QUANTITY]] from me .
more infringements - shocker .
only the [[ORG]] can weaponize drones . how dare you commoners defy the monopoly .
better make sure the terrorists gets the memo .
oh , they wo n't let us have any fun !
weaponized drones are coming whether the [[ORG]] wants it or not . one that can drop a package can carry a bomb or have a gun attached to it to fire . expect other things being dropped such as incendiaries and caustic liquids . you think rules will stop them ? about as effective as gun laws stop mass shooters .
drones are covered by the [[ORDINAL]] amendment
once it 's weaponized ?
being weapons are in common use on drones in the military , this act by the [[ORG]] would technically violate the [[ORDINAL]] amendment
heavy drone usage in " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . major ideas there ....
frankly , i 'm surprised homegrown terrorists are n't using this to their advantage already . imagine rigging a drone with a remote activated release system . now imagine outfitting the drone with a payload of a pound or [[CARDINAL]] of homemade thermite , also with a remote trigger . now imagine flying the drone over an oil refinery or a fuel storage depot . use your imagination for the rest .
a swarm - attack on a stadium is what i 'm waiting to see happen .
the scary thing is that it is totally possible . think back to the light show during [[DATE]] [[EVENT]] done completely with quad copters ( drones ) .
major events like that usually have a bomb squad and hazmat contingent present . they constantly conduct checks for suspicious devices . i 'm sure they probably have a device that alerts them if drone radio control signals are detected . what they can to to jam or otherwise neutralize those drones once detected is an open question .
a marine turned teacher was just arrested for speculating as you just did . welcome to freedom .
this is the day & age when schoolchildren are arrested for chewing their sandwich into the shape of a gun at lunchtime .
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] " are unconstitutional . tell them to pound sand and enjoy your property as you see fit .
oh , it 's coming . the techniques have been in use & improved for [[DATE]] in [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] only a matter of time before they find their way here .
pandora 's box = drones .
i guess " i told you so " is in order !
this [[ORG]] warning is as forbidding as a " gun free zone " sticker .
legalize freedom . do nt vote . declare your independence !
just kind of making it up as you go , huh [[ORG]] ? the " law " refers to flying a craft , as being in the craft and flying it . as i 'm sure you will , you 'll have to come up with a law specifying personal / recreational drone weaponization .
never let facts get in the way of govt extortion and violence .
weaponized drones are hitting [[GPE]] as we speak . delivery drones are dropping drug shipments in the [[GPE]] as we speak . not much you can really do about this . . .
growing up , i remember having an airplane with a little [[CARDINAL]] gas engine on it and it flew by [[CARDINAL]] cords connected to a plastic handle ...... you had to turn circles in place to fly it as it went around . when it ran out of gas you glided it down to a landing . those were our drones .
a poor definition , " dangerous weapons " . the rotor blades alone fit that definition .
and the rest of the drone as well .
unless they belong to [[GPE]] gov then it ’s ok .
swalwell was planning on using drones with nuclear weapons to attack [[ORG]] who would n't give up their firearms !
the drone itself can be used as a weapon .
i avail myself of my 2nd amendment rights often . but i am for this restriction with the exception that a person could be trained licensed and liability insured for it . i do nt want some kid tying an [[ORG]] firework to his drone and accidentally burning a house down with kids in it because his radioshack drone malfunctioned .
buy a drone payload release mechanism for cheap . fishermen are using drones to drop their bait and tackle exactly where they want it .
if they drop their tackle , how do they get it back ?
they train it to swim back to the boat real fast and jump in before being eaten
tie your line to the tackle , release bail on reel , fly to destination , release tackle , bring back drone , wait for fish .
and [[DATE]] ’s “ capt obvious ” award goes to the [[ORG]]
so only the govt can put bombs on drones ? great idea . they seem like a swell bunch .
the firepower should be left to the military . civilians should stick to cell phones and drugs they fly over prison walls to sell .
right , because only the police or military are allowed to operate armed drones . sorry , but i see a 2nd amendment suit in their future .
not a [[CARDINAL]] issue . give it a break and i ’m a [[CARDINAL]] supporter .
unless the govt tells you " no " . then you roll over like a good little statist .
actually it can be seen as a 2nd amendment issue .
the way the [[ORDINAL]] amendment reads anyone should be able to have their own personal nuclear weapons ... maybe it 's time to accept that it was written [[DATE]] by people who were not gods and all knowing , but by people who drafted the best document they could in their lifetimes .
we the people should have demanded the abolishment of weapons of mass destruction decades ago . we honestly should be having very serious discussions about the disarmament of our govt .
maybe not a nuke , but any weapon in common use by the military of the time
you do n't have your own nuclear weapon ? you 're missing out on all the fun !
my preference is the " neutron " leaves the building standing .
that is the reason behind it , the government has no rights to any of them . the weapons are supposed to belong to us , to give us an option for a tyrannical government . and yes , if they had known about nukes , they would not want the feds to be the only ones with them either ...
you 're giving people ideas ! ! i just invented something ... attach a can of paint , and do some aerial graffiti .
well , [[ORG]] ! ! ! !
sad that common sense must be regulated .
true , but fireworks seems a bit of overreach . have had a lot of fun with drones and fireworks .
[[PERSON]] are like cyber security . . . they work great until the big mishap .
not a whole lot of that around [[DATE]] .
