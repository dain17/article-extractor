something else , when i was a kid , this would be considered normal fun . oh no , visit from [[ORG]] is coming .
i certainly hope that the terrorists have read this , now we do n't have to worry right ? after all they follow all the gun laws , right ?
fix the [[ORG]] issue not the tool alone .
oh my ! now we 're sure to be [[PERCENT]] safe from drone based weapons based terrorism , death , and carnage . i feel so relieved . not ! { o.o }
as long as we keep them above the ' hood they are doing a great service to [[GPE]]
hmmm , is our government getting a little scared that the citizens might have discovered a way to have aerial coverage when tshtf
the [[ORG]] can not make law . so it is not illegal . the [[ORG]] does not have [[ORG]] to make laws . they can spout their rule all they want . it is not law .
human beings are are going to do what human beings do , and you ca n't put the toothpaste back in the tube . we were kicked out of paradise because of our need for more and propensity to listen to the devil more than god , even when we all ready have more than we need .
terrorists ( and antiphags ) do not follow the law . so this regulation only applies to law abiding citizens .
yeah , and sick people are n't supposed to get their hands on [[ORG]] 's either .
heck , when i was a kid we used to tape bottle rockets to paper airplanes to make paper jets . they went up , blew up and came down in flames .
the guvmint could have weaponized drones airborne in conus at the drop of a hat .
faa- ever heard of the highly effective cruise missile , pilotless fighter jets , [[ORG]] ?
i started helping a friend of mine develop a system to use drones for crop spraying , but he had to stop when he found out that if he were to use drone commercially , he had to have pilot 's licence . even with a pre - programmed flight plan ( with some serious safety systems in place ) , the fact that it was commercial operation meant that the person operating or responsible for the flying of the drone had to have a pilot 's licence . i think that the [[ORG]] is terrified of drones .
i wonder if the military was informed of this ?
pepper spray , itching powder , tear gas will soon be used to disperse unruly crowds . like at soccer games .
there is definitely a place for drone ammo . rc aircraft with [[ORG]] bullets . rc aerial battles .
[[PERSON]] invented the drone .
a drone and all rc flying toys are dangerous weapons ! " dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury .
the government says , do n't do as i do , just do as i say .
" ' dangerous weapons ' are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . " if misused , the drone , itself , can be used for or be able to cause death or serious bodily injury . so can a car . so can a lighter . so can a butter knife . so can a pencil . so can a thought . they all can be " weapons " , as defined by the [[ORG]] . thinking about it can [[ORG]] !
well then , make a place for them !
personally , a roman candle on one side would be fun .
this is a direct result of the viral [[ORDINAL]] of [[DATE]] roman candle drone video ...
the only people who are shaking in their boots now are the folks who would never arm a drone . :(
from above , " " dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . " a drone , all by itself , flying at maximum speed can do the above . so obviously the [[ORG]] has n't thought this through .
most pilots of [[ORG]] ( drone ) are responsible pilots who use the craft as either a camera platform , or a r / c aircraft for sport flying . the focal length of the lens is con conducive to spying on individuals . as with any device , they can and are miss used .
i 'm waiting for [[ORG]] 's opinion on this before i give up my bomb carrying drown .
a see a new profession on the horizon , a drone hunter
it 's my [[ORDINAL]] amendment right to attach dangerous weapons to my drone .
anyone ever see those cool drones that fly over other drones and drop a bunch of shoe laces into the propellers ?
what if the gun on our drone is [[GPE]] ? sanctuary policies come into play
do n't tell [[ORG]] that !
the [[ORG]] thinks this warning will prevent anyone weaponizing a drone . it just gave many the idea . thanks .
government should have thought about that before approving them for civilian use . humans are creative and not always in a good way . anything that can be weaponized will be . if it can be used to commit murder it will be . welcome to [[DATE]] .
cameras are the most dangerous things mounted on drones .
unless they 're over [[GPE]]
there goes my weekend activitiies
lol . so only the criminal / terrorist at heart will do this . what law abiding citizen would attach a bomb to a drone ?
unless they are being flown in public or residential areas , the government does not have compelling interest in infringing on our right to attach weapons to drones . however ridiculous doing so may be .
aw shucks , i guess i have to dismantle my double [[PRODUCT]] drone .
drone hunting trip to the high plains has been canceled .
whaaaaat ? no guns , bombs or fireworks allowed on drones anymore ? well ok , l guess we 'll just have to switch to bags full of gasoline , acid and medical waste then .... or maybe the [[ORG]] classic children 's toys ? " bag - o - nails , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] " ! [[PERSON]]
i think the police should definitely support the development of armed drone technology , to reach and neutralize mass shooters faster and safer .
if the word illegal means nothing to the dims when discussing immigration - why does illegal matter in other situations ?
its my drone ... launched from my land .... flying over my land ... with legally purchased " attachments " .. the [[ORG]] does nt allow inventors to experiment ? and if they " buzz " me with their drone trying to spy on me .. is nt that trespassing in my airspace ? ..
my drone identifies as a holster , so get bent .
ok point taken . do not strap an abortion doctor to your drone .
the militias are exempt . the [[ORG]] ca nt regulate the militia . the government ca nt stand competition .
" dangerous weapons " are defined as objects or items that are used for or able to cause death or serious bodily injury . ... so let this be a lesson : do n't strap a liberal to your drone .
did n't say anything about missiles .
is it ok if i have a gun free zone sticker on my drone ? what if the gun chose to stow away on its own without my knowledge , as guns are prone to act out on their own ?
they can have whatever law they want . a criminal is not required to follow the law .
i 'm a licensed drone operator . it really does n't take a whole lot of common sense to know that you should n't equip your drone with lethal gadgets . but then again , it 's the [[ORG]] and we live in a nanny state .
flame throwers are legal in my state ...
[[NORP]] of killjoys .
drones will be the deliverer of the next attack .
i am ok with this one . i do n't think my neighbor should be able to fly a drone over my property with a weapon on it . i do n't see it as infringement on [[DATE]] . i carry , my weapon is on my person , not flying [[QUANTITY]] from me .
more infringements - shocker .
only the [[ORG]] can weaponize drones . how dare you commoners defy the monopoly .
better make sure the terrorists gets the memo .
oh , they wo n't let us have any fun !
weaponized drones are coming whether the [[ORG]] wants it or not . one that can drop a package can carry a bomb or have a gun attached to it to fire . expect other things being dropped such as incendiaries and caustic liquids . you think rules will stop them ? about as effective as gun laws stop mass shooters .
drones are covered by the [[ORDINAL]] amendment
being weapons are in common use on drones in the military , this act by the [[ORG]] would technically violate the [[ORDINAL]] amendment
heavy drone usage in " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . major ideas there ....
frankly , i 'm surprised homegrown terrorists are n't using this to their advantage already . imagine rigging a drone with a remote activated release system . now imagine outfitting the drone with a payload of a pound or [[CARDINAL]] of homemade thermite , also with a remote trigger . now imagine flying the drone over an oil refinery or a fuel storage depot . use your imagination for the rest .
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] " are unconstitutional . tell them to pound sand and enjoy your property as you see fit .
oh , it 's coming . the techniques have been in use & improved for [[DATE]] in [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] only a matter of time before they find their way here .
pandora 's box = drones .
i guess " i told you so " is in order !
this [[ORG]] warning is as forbidding as a " gun free zone " sticker .
legalize freedom . do nt vote . declare your independence !
just kind of making it up as you go , huh [[ORG]] ? the " law " refers to flying a craft , as being in the craft and flying it . as i 'm sure you will , you 'll have to come up with a law specifying personal / recreational drone weaponization .
weaponized drones are hitting [[GPE]] as we speak . delivery drones are dropping drug shipments in the [[GPE]] as we speak . not much you can really do about this . . .
growing up , i remember having an airplane with a little [[CARDINAL]] gas engine on it and it flew by [[CARDINAL]] cords connected to a plastic handle ...... you had to turn circles in place to fly it as it went around . when it ran out of gas you glided it down to a landing . those were our drones .
a poor definition , " dangerous weapons " . the rotor blades alone fit that definition .
unless they belong to [[GPE]] gov then it ’s ok .
swalwell was planning on using drones with nuclear weapons to attack [[ORG]] who would n't give up their firearms !
the drone itself can be used as a weapon .
i avail myself of my 2nd amendment rights often . but i am for this restriction with the exception that a person could be trained licensed and liability insured for it . i do nt want some kid tying an [[ORG]] firework to his drone and accidentally burning a house down with kids in it because his radioshack drone malfunctioned .
buy a drone payload release mechanism for cheap . fishermen are using drones to drop their bait and tackle exactly where they want it .
and [[DATE]] ’s “ capt obvious ” award goes to the [[ORG]]
the firepower should be left to the military . civilians should stick to cell phones and drugs they fly over prison walls to sell .
right , because only the police or military are allowed to operate armed drones . sorry , but i see a 2nd amendment suit in their future .
you 're giving people ideas ! ! i just invented something ... attach a can of paint , and do some aerial graffiti .
well , [[ORG]] ! ! ! !
sad that common sense must be regulated .
