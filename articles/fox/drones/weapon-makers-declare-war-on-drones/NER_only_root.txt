for people saying drones can not bring down an airliner ... all a drone has to do is carry a [[QUANTITY]] 1/4"thick tungsten rod ( or other hard material ) [[CARDINAL]] - 24 " long and fly into the engine and that would probably be enough to cause terminal failure of that engine . this would be most effective when a [[QUANTITY]] plane is taking off overloaded to where it can not land safely until it burns off fuel . drones are a real threat to airports .
10 [[ORG]] long barreled bolt gun , designed for [[NORP]] . should work fine .
did they ever confirm a drone at [[PERSON]] ? i heard ( from someone who lives in [[GPE]] ) that after [[DATE]] , nobody could confirm a drone , and they thought maybe people saw / reported police drones ! ! !
i use anti - drone technology . it 's called a [[PERSON]] [[CARDINAL]] .
" that has prompted a global arms race among manufacturers to develop new anti - drone technology . often the same companies that sell drones also market equipment to down them . " i love the pure capitalistic mindset behind this . " we will sell them to you , and sell you the way to destroy them . " it should inspire companies like [[ORG]] to buy [[ORG]] . " [[ORG]] will fatten you up while [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] will thin you back down . "
i have an anti drone system at my house . [[PERSON]] [[CARDINAL]] gage .
so , the corporations rushed to create a drone industry ... now they 're rushing to create an anti - drone industry . corporations will be the end of humanity .
a father in [[GPE]] saw a drone flying over his house while his teenage daughter was sun bathing in the back yard . he took out his 12 gauge and blew it out of the sky - lol - true story
ya take down a $ [[MONEY]] drone with a $ [[MONEY]] missile . makes sense to me . me i 'd use my 12 ga and charge ya $ [[MONEY]] .
is it me or did this story kind of drone on # [[MONEY]]
that 's the way it 's always been . build weapons . build defense . build new weapons . build new defenses . build a country . build a fence ? oh no , we ca n't do that ..
" armed forces , in contrast , typically have more leeway to use lethal force to down unmanned aircraft because they do nâ€™t have to worry about nearby airplanes and civilians . " it is technically impossible to use " lethal force " against an unmanned drone .
welcome to [[NORP]] tech at its best
for [[DATE]] , we had the technology to interfere with airports and launch weapons ; rc planes and model rockets immediately come to mind . the problem is n't the drones ... it 's the people and lack of common sense .
have been puzzled for [[DATE]] by the apparent inability of organisations against which the [[GPE]] and other countries such as [[GPE]] have been using drones for [[DATE]] to disrupt and eliminate them . perhaps those organisations surprisingly have lacked the technical knowledge and equipment to do so , but according to this article that may change quickly .
[[PERSON]] was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom . what we did not realize is that if you try to take that freedom , they resist . the war will teach us much . humanity needs to surrender its freedom willingly . [[PERSON]] has been secretly feeding crises , reaping war , raising taxes , murdering [[CARDINAL]] ! government has created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security . once the purification process is complete , [[ORG]] will arise .
i think i found the end of the internet ?
the more technology becomes affordable the more it will be used by our enemies . it 's simple to weaponize a drone and a tough nut to stop them . especially since they can swarm [[CARDINAL]] of them for less than the cost of [[CARDINAL]] defense system .
ca n't shoot when can damage civilian areas ... thinking laser tech ... but what happens to the destroyed craft ?
my [[PERSON]] has declared war on drones
did n't some guy in [[GPE]] get charged with criminal mischief for shooting down a drone over his house ? why do i have a bad attitude ? or at least i think it 's a bad attitude . and i still do n't understand why most people need drones .
i hear a good shotgun will also work .
drones ? ? ? do you mean liberals ? ? ?
fun stuff
just make a swarm of drones that seek out and crash into enemy drones .
in [[LOC]] , birds of prey are taught to take down smaller drones , works very well .
the same companies that make them are the ones that make the ones that bring them down . sounds like the computer virus makers .
i build drones in my basement . i can build a basic drone for [[MONEY]] . i fly them for fun . it is a hobby . it is how some adults unwind . i also own a [[PERSON]] [[CARDINAL]] , [[ORDINAL]] gen. if someone shoots at me .... i will shoot back .
wait until [[ORG]] releases a small swarm ( maybe [[CARDINAL]] ? ) of drones near , say , [[FAC]] airport , each loaded with an ounce or [[CARDINAL]] of explosives ? they can tell them to target any large jetliner . even if it is not moving , a small explosive on the body or wing of the jet makes it [[MONEY]] piece of junk until repaired . they could disable every jet on the airport and cause no end of delays and costs and repair bills . they spend [[MONEY]] , they cause [[CARDINAL]] in costs . a very economic way to wage war .
drones should be fully licensed , with recorded [[CARDINAL]] .... hey , i had to pay to have an " [[ORG]] radio license " to just use a cb in the old days ! !
they will become fully licensed and require full background checks soon , it would n't take much to weaponize even a civilian drone model
you can buy anti - drone 12 gauge shot shells now that shoot a net to entangle the blades of your neighbor 's annoying quad - copter style drones . if you miss the drone , it slowly parachutes back down so you ca n't accidentally harm bystanders .
let me know when you 've got illegal immigration drones and i 'll invest
i am gon na buy some before they ban them . do n't fly a drone over my property .
