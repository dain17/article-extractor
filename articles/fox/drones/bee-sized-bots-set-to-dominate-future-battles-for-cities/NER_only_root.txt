military technology is always [[CARDINAL]] - 50 years ahead of what they claim are the current newest toys .
a swarm of microbot drones and the womens ' dorms . yeah , that 's what i 'm talking about .
[[CARDINAL]] question : how are these powered and charged ? watt - up , perhaps . energous would be a perfect fit here if they are n't already in it . ! ! ! !
most people would find this exciting , and it is ; that is until artificial intelligence ( [[ORG]] ) is deployed in mass fashion . that will be frightening as a scenario such as i - robot could become a reality . i read a piece [[DATE]] about [[GPE]] . the code back then was to the point where it could " re - create " itself . what that means is that the programming behind the [[ORG]] , created a " child " , which was a version of itself that it wrote without any human intervention . and somewhere around the [[ORDINAL]] generation of the code , the scientists were doing some testing whereby the different versions were competing in some type of scenario and had to take turns while doing so . i do n't rememeber the exact details , but suffice it to say that one of the " child versions " near the [[ORDINAL]] generation started cheating . it learned to look out for its own " best intertest " and began cheating in the scenario being tested . now imagine [[CARDINAL]] of " child programs " and what they might do . ie take over the human race or god knows what else . for me the worse case sceneia would be one the robots with the [[GPE]] deciding it 's a " [[NORP]] " . me personally ? i think the version that " cheated " was the [[ORDINAL]] [[NORP]] on the upcoming robot world . may god help us , we 'll need it .
i guess [[PERSON]] wo n't be of any use .
if they are going to use drones in swarms , they may as well use hive like neural processing techniques to create a single digital neural net .
scary . i wanna go back in time .
revelation [[CARDINAL]] ?
many , [[DATE]] i read the invincible ( [[NORP]] : [[ORG]] ) a science fiction novel by [[NORP]] writer [[PERSON]] , published in [[DATE]] . story line : an interstellar space ship called invincible lands on planet [[FAC]] , which seems uninhabited , to investigate the loss of her sister ship , [[PERSON]] . during the investigation , the crew finds evidence of a form of quasi - life , born from the evolution of autonomous , self - replicating machines , who millennia ago killed off their creators . perhaps we should be paying attention ?
search for the short video " slaughterbots " ...
borg
this has tremendous potential for good . however it can also be used to spy on people without a warrant . be careful .
and who thinks making microscopic machines that act and think on their own as a hive - mind and arming them is a good idea ?
best way to keep our troops safe -- bring them home , and do n't send them in harm 's way ...
their most frightening use is landing on your head and exploding
i remember these pesky little guys in high school . we called them crabs .
a lot of potential to move from the battlefield and into your living room . will " little brother " need a warrant ?
and ......... the religion of peace is already figuring out a way to use these to kill innocent people .
maybe [[GPE]] could use them to clean up the poop on the sidewalks and streets .
" i 'm sorry [[PERSON]] , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that "
these are not " robots " . these are simply ordinary electronic components . a couple of inductors , a couple of resistors , a couple of capacitors . nothing but complete nonsense .
she always has cool stuff .
you can bet if you are reading about this it is already done and being used .
big brother is on alive and well -- and improving his technology all the time .
and when the world finally runs out of some of the natural resources to build and run all the crap we use , we will revert back to stone age times . and most humans will die off without the ability to feed shelter and clothe themselves .
and citizens need countermeasures for when they are used here .
bots ... misnomer , these are sensors for larger centralized intelligence .... singularity , here we come .
nuclear power ; make electricity too cheap to meter !
read [[PERSON]] " storm " or watch [[ORG]] episode " hated in the nation" ... these things are scary !
this has arrived at the right time , it seems we have poisoned our environment enough that the insect population has dropped by [[PERCENT]] . some have measured this by the amount of biomass collected on their windshield on [[DATE]] . maybe in [[DATE]] all life on earth will be artificial . i 've seen a movie depicting this , including [[QUANTITY]] ice sheet covering [[GPE]] .
[[PERSON]] will be proud .
not to be an alarmist , but , if in fact this comes to pass ... goodbye , humanity .
[[PERSON]] ( [[GPE]] , etc . ) wrote a novel [[DATE]] . check out prey ... swarms of microbots that develop autonomous intelligence . awesome stuff if you 're a tech fan .
focused emp guns or arrays to fry their electronics . physics is a wonderful thing . " the electro - magnetic pulse generator , or [[ORG]] generator , is a device capable of generating a transient electromagnetic disturbance that radiates outward from its epicenter , disrupting electronic devices ( or frying , depending on its capacity ) . "
why do i see this not working out as we are told it should ?
