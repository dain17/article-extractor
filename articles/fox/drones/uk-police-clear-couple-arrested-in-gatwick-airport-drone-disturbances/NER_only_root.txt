since it is gb i am surprised they do n't require licences for all drones just like they regulate everything else there .
now that that 's been settled , who done it ?
so in other words , there may not have even been a drone , just people " reporting " they saw one . hmm . i guess people have a new way to disrupt flights with nothing more than a phone call .
of interest to me and not mentioned in the article is how the cops got hold of this couple in the [[ORDINAL]] place , . i am assuming there are [[CARDINAL]] if not [[CARDINAL]] of people living around the airport . did the cops just blindly throw a stone and arrest the people in the house where the stone fell ?
it 's actually easier to just print the news of when government does n't fail .
small , agile , hard - to - spot ( and also hard - to - hit ) remotely controlled drones are the military revolution of [[DATE]] . this may be just the beginning .
we here in [[GPE]] have a missile defense system called [[ORG]] , which can detect and acquire an incoming missile , calculate its projected trajectory and , within [[TIME]] , launch an anti missile missile to blow the hostile incoming rocket out of the sky , if the hostile rocket is destined to land in a populated area . a little bit of software modification and the system should be able to handle drones . buy an iron dome system from us for every airport and problem solved . heck , haggle with us and you might even be able to buy [[CARDINAL]] and get 1 free .
the real news is that the couple that were arrested were detained on suspicion and interrogated for [[TIME]] without an attorney present because the male had a model remote controlled helicopter and they lived near the airport . they were later released because they both were nowhere near the airport when the " drone incursion " occurred . no warrant . no evidence . just a hunch gets you arrested . i think they should sue for false arrest .
hobby drones are easy to crash with a jammer . every police department should have one .
make it simple ban drones it solves the whole problem.limit them to government and select businesses as intended . then you know who to look at .
after [[TIME]] of waterboarding and the inhuman torture of having to listen to continuous [[WORK_OF_ART]] order islam favoring brain screwing speeches , as in drivel , piped directly through head - phones ... the innocent suspects were released to [[ORG]] for observation and hopefully recovery form the ordeal ...
at least they had decency to clear suspects instead of claiming " insufficient evidence " .
[[ORG]] can call our [[ORG]] for help . they 'll send a backflipping dancer right over .
does n't anyone have a shotgun over there . birdshot comes down virtually harmless . drone comes down period .
the reason for such fear by authorities is that for under $ [[MONEY]] you can build an emp device that will destroy all electronics within a [[QUANTITY]] radius . the [[ORG]] device can be mounted on a drone and used to disable the flight computers and control systems on the aircraft . once a drone with an [[ORG]] device downs a passenger plane then people the world over will come to realize just how dangerous air travel truly is in this modern age .
i do n't get why they could not stop it . [[ORG]] and gps jammers would cut the drones communications helicopters or other drones with nets to snag it 12 gauge shotgun with # [[MONEY]] shot would shred it without ground collateral damage emp device like [[ORG]] used on cars would scramble the drones electronics [[PERSON]] it with another drone etc etc etc
i 've seen a drone with a real honest - to - god flamethrower on it clearing power lines of debris . all you would have to do is bump the drones propeller to down it . what am i missing here ?
the droning was from [[ORG]] .
time to call in sherlock holmes .
so [[CARDINAL]] innocent people got trashed by the press and their neighbors because of a rush to judgement .
