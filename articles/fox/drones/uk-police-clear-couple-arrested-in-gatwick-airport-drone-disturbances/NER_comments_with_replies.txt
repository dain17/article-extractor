since it is gb i am surprised they do n't require licences for all drones just like they regulate everything else there .
now that that 's been settled , who done it ?
so in other words , there may not have even been a drone , just people " reporting " they saw one . hmm . i guess people have a new way to disrupt flights with nothing more than a phone call .
i saw videos . were they actual drone incursions or file footage ?
of interest to me and not mentioned in the article is how the cops got hold of this couple in the [[ORDINAL]] place , . i am assuming there are [[CARDINAL]] if not [[CARDINAL]] of people living around the airport . did the cops just blindly throw a stone and arrest the people in the house where the stone fell ?
yup , that 's how cops work . and once the arrest you , they toss a coin , head they win , tails you lose . you has the fritz alright .
it 's actually easier to just print the news of when government does n't fail .
small , agile , hard - to - spot ( and also hard - to - hit ) remotely controlled drones are the military revolution of [[DATE]] . this may be just the beginning .
we here in [[GPE]] have a missile defense system called [[ORG]] , which can detect and acquire an incoming missile , calculate its projected trajectory and , within [[TIME]] , launch an anti missile missile to blow the hostile incoming rocket out of the sky , if the hostile rocket is destined to land in a populated area . a little bit of software modification and the system should be able to handle drones . buy an iron dome system from us for every airport and problem solved . heck , haggle with us and you might even be able to buy [[CARDINAL]] and get 1 free .
the real news is that the couple that were arrested were detained on suspicion and interrogated for [[TIME]] without an attorney present because the male had a model remote controlled helicopter and they lived near the airport . they were later released because they both were nowhere near the airport when the " drone incursion " occurred . no warrant . no evidence . just a hunch gets you arrested . i think they should sue for false arrest .
[[NORP]] law nearly aways favors the state over the individual . the [[NORP]] lawyers who helped write [[LAW]] screwed us up , too .
too bad you feel screwed by our constitution . you may want to check on moving to [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] . their constitutions may be ideal for you , but only if you are a black person .
hobby drones are easy to crash with a jammer . every police department should have one .
it ’s actually very difficult . the cheesy demo video is just a concept . nothing like that exists . dji has software that gives a backdoor to its drones , but it ’s a [[CARDINAL]] setup only sold to airports . so , your wrong .
make it simple ban drones it solves the whole problem.limit them to government and select businesses as intended . then you know who to look at .
wow , another " let 's confiscate " , screw your rights , ding bat . overreacting much ? technophobe ?
after [[TIME]] of waterboarding and the inhuman torture of having to listen to continuous [[WORK_OF_ART]] order islam favoring brain screwing speeches , as in drivel , piped directly through head - phones ... the innocent suspects were released to [[ORG]] for observation and hopefully recovery form the ordeal ...
at least they had decency to clear suspects instead of claiming " insufficient evidence " .
[[ORG]] can call our [[ORG]] for help . they 'll send a backflipping dancer right over .
does n't anyone have a shotgun over there . birdshot comes down virtually harmless . drone comes down period .
the drone was at [[QUANTITY]] . shotguns at best have a range [[QUANTITY]] .
the reason for such fear by authorities is that for under $ [[MONEY]] you can build an emp device that will destroy all electronics within a [[QUANTITY]] radius . the [[ORG]] device can be mounted on a drone and used to disable the flight computers and control systems on the aircraft . once a drone with an [[ORG]] device downs a passenger plane then people the world over will come to realize just how dangerous air travel truly is in this modern age .
total " $ [[MONEY]] " bull !
even [[MONEY]] would be considered cheap compared to the damage it could cause
i do n't get why they could not stop it . [[ORG]] and gps jammers would cut the drones communications helicopters or other drones with nets to snag it 12 gauge shotgun with # [[MONEY]] shot would shred it without ground collateral damage emp device like [[ORG]] used on cars would scramble the drones electronics [[PERSON]] it with another drone etc etc etc
i 've seen a drone with a real honest - to - god flamethrower on it clearing power lines of debris . all you would have to do is bump the drones propeller to down it . what am i missing here ?
all you really need is a high power transmitter in the same band as the drones use ( [[CARDINAL]] ghz ? ) and a highly directional antenna ( shielded [[CARDINAL]] element [[ORG]] ) . this could be used to overload the drone 's receiver 's front end and cause the offender to lose control . something like what i suggest would be no bigger than a small shoulder mounted rocket launcher .
what do you have against flamethrowers ? merry [[DATE]] brother .
used correctly by a competent person a flame thrower is a useful tool , but in this case it does n't have the range required and has too much risk of collateral damage .
the droning was from [[ORG]] .
time to call in sherlock holmes .
so [[CARDINAL]] innocent people got trashed by the press and their neighbors because of a rush to judgement .
we 've seen it before ... when the [[ORG]] accused that poor security guard - who was doing his job - of planting the explosive device in [[GPE]] . the man 's life was destroyed and he died well before his time . great work [[ORG]] - you can put that in your book of successes along with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and the [[GPE]] , whose brother turned him in . why do n't you spend your time cleaning out your own house and take on real criminals like [[PERSON]] , [[PERSON]] , [[PERSON]] too many to name really .
yeah , i can tell you read the article . there 's no mention of the [[ORG]] . that was the [[PERSON]] police .
well ... duh ... i can tell you did n't read my comment . i 'm merely saying that we 've seen what happens before when there is a rush to judgment by law enforcement - no matter where they are located . go back to bed .
he ai n't named stupedo for nothin' !
boy ! you hit the nail on the head with that post .
