yeah , sure ... just " seeing what s going on "
misdemeanor ? come on , how about a major felony ? perhaps [[DATE]] in federal jail will make people realize how dangerous these drones are ? if officers had crashed and died then manslaughter and [[DATE]] .
it wo n't be too long before the [[NORP]] domestic terrorist [[PERSON]] put away their assault style rifles and [[CARDINAL]] rounds of ammunition and begin to load drones full of explosives to crash through stain glass windows at churches , elementary classroom windows , and through the front double doors at [[ORG]] . what 's [[PERSON]] doj going to do about those [[PERSON]] ?
dry run for a drone attack on police helicopters . next time the drone will be carrying a small amount of explosives .
new drones are software restricted to [[QUANTITY]] ? [[ORG]] indicates that manned aircraft should not be operated [[CARDINAL]] above occupied structures ? sounds like lapd hit the drone ?
it was intentional , you will see a lot more of this in the future ! question is , will [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] put their logos on the drones they use ?
hmm , and maybe the chopper pilot should be arrested for crashing into the kid 's drone .
let me understand this : lapd helicopter fly ’s into a toy drone . kind like flying into a kite or a flock of birds . at best this is [[PERCENT]] fault of the helicopter pilot if not more . the helicopter entered the airspace of the already flying toy . how low was this helicopter flying if it hit the toy ? [[CARDINAL]] ft . the helicopter should should have been much higher to avoid such incidences .
[[PERSON]] , [[CARDINAL]] * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ' question : was ice contacted ? ?
now that this is out in the news , you will hear that more of this will start to happen .
if [[ORG]] is using drones to deliver packages , i 'm sure drug dealers are figuring out how to use the technology too .
wrong laws , damaging an aircraft and causing it to crash . federal crime with [[DATE]] of prison time .
" reckless drone endangerment " it sounds like the police helicopter flew into the drone . the drone appears smaller than some pelicans , so if i were the helicopter pilot i 'd have my vision checked .
i am sure as i am sitting here typing this that this is not the case . the drone did not hit the helicopter … the helicopter hit the drone . anyone believes otherwise is an idiot .
[[GPE]] loads work great for drone eradication
[[ORG]] ...
accident or not this guy deserves the maximum .
all it takes is [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] ignorant jerks to take down an international hobby . when golfers toss their clubs in fits of anger , how come they never hit aircraft ? and if they did , how much you wanna bet the government would be right there to start regulating the sport including background checks and limiting the number of clubs a bag can hold
seems to me the [[ORG]] would regulate drones , can outfit them with bombs and all kinds of weapons .
this is like cops chasing a car down the street and hitting another driver . i do n't understand the ' outrage ' among commenters here . ignorance ?
pedophiles most likely own the most drones .
good grief . you people disappoint me .
have to agree with [[GPE]] on this one . owning an expensive toy brings responsibility .
either the drone was flying above the legal maximum altitude of [[QUANTITY]] , or the helicopter was flying below [[QUANTITY]] , but the law also says that a drone should not be flown near or above emergency vehicles or personnel .
this was antifa practice . next time they 'll load the drone with explosives ....
that guy was thinking " if i bump the chopper , nobody will get hurt . most people will support more government , but a lot of people will see the police admitting how weak their choppers are to attack " . good job both ways , idiots , now everyone knows you 're idiots
police helicopters get free reign over the skies ? so if i 'm flying my drone over my house and they decide to fly through for whatever reason it 's my fault ?
this guy lives in [[GPE]] . too bad he did n't get a woke attorney before talking to police . he would have been instructed to claim that he was doing aerial documentation of systemic racism and xenophobia . no one in [[GPE]] would ever convict someone of endangering police in the pursuit of " social justice . "
had the drone hit the main rotors , the drone would have been shredded .
why are conservatives so anti - drone ? it amazes me .
sounds more like the police chopper ran into the already there drone ? ?
there are real , practical beneficial uses for drones , but when i see [[CARDINAL]] hovering over my house it gives me the creeps .
it would have been a feel good story if it hit the blades and pygocoptor hit the squad care .
i would claim the helicopter hit my drone . and would want them to pay for it .
[[DATE]] is not enough . also , who is paying for all of this . i have a idea about who should .
did [[ORG]] have an [[ORG]] part [[CARDINAL]] license ?
that is considered and act of terrorism . capital punishment is a proper sentence .
drones need to be registered if they have a capability range over . [[QUANTITY]] .
he should have just burned down the [[GPE]] courthouse . they 'd have left him alone and he would n't have gone to jail . this is how our law enforcement is now being conducted . sad ...
admit nothing , ever .
it always takes just a fraction of the users of anything to get the rest of the users in trouble , be it drones , guns , or fast motorcycles .
what a moron .
operator needs an award - dumbshit of [[DATE]]
they ca n't prove it was intentional crash , but crooks are smart nowadays , they do use drones as look outs , just need some more investigating .
the operator broke the law . do n't know if it was an accident or on purpose-- do n't really care but hope a hefty fine comes with it .
more to come
your best defense is to shut the hell up and admit nothing .
what an idiot .
attempted murder - throw the book at the loser
this is the same thing happening with liberals taking over !
fake news ! let 's get it right . . . they arrested the helicopter pilot for crashing into the drone . it 's [[GPE]] , remember ?
riots broke out in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] after a white [[PERSON]] helicopter destroyed a black drone . film at [[CARDINAL]] .
if the drone was flying at the lawful [[PERSON]] altitude defined by the [[ORG]] and not within restricted airspace he should not be charged with any serious crime . certainly both a drone and a helicopter could cross paths because helicopters can fly within the drones defined altitude . the person may not have had time to respond to the helicopter approaching at a fast rate of speed . most of the time when you hear one you ca n't tell from which direction it is coming from . he has a good chance of not going to jail over this and only receiving a fine . i 'm a drone operator too with a [[ORG]] registered drone .
pilot error on the part of the helicopter pilot , forgiven due to the blue wall of illegal activities ? a pilot is responsible to [[ORG]] , even with [[ORG]] , much less a slow flying drone .
got ta know the rules if you 're going to fly . even if it 's just a drone . was it within the [[QUANTITY]] altitude limit ? and within his line of vision ?
irresponsible use of a drown ... plain and simple .
it 's a misdemeanor so he 'll go to jail for a long time . if he had committed arson as an antifa rioter , on the other hand , he 'd be released and home by nightfall .
your drone must be licensed with the [[ORG]] and have its registration number visibly displayed . hey , it 's [[MONEY]] for a non - commercial pilot . he must have skipped that if the cops had to identify him from drone footage .
deport him instanter
now [[PERSON]] can do a [[DATE]] stretch at the state pen so he can “ see what was going on . ”
i love reading the [[PERSON]] that fond a way to minimize the accident or sway the blame towards the helicopter . let 's all hope and pray the the next drone crash hits your mom in her teeth and you get to watch
should have been charged with reckless endangerment , he put the helicopter pilot and the ground personnel in peril .
if your objective is to call attention to the safety issues surrounding privately - operated drones , then i 'd guess flying yours into a police helicopter is a pretty effective strategy .
beefstroganof still think about you , hope you ’re doing well
considering the relative velocities of the [[CARDINAL]] objects , i am pretty sure the helicopter hit the drone .
all these commenters just droning on
doh ! ! ! ! !
welcome to [[ORG]] . now that we no longer have free elections in this country the atheistic [[NORP]] are taking over . they do n't even pretend to follow the [[LAW]] anymore . since god is dead then might makes right !
did blm get the riots organized yet ?
hernandez was delivering drugs with the drone
is the guy legal in the [[GPE]] or just another [[PERSON]] with [[CARDINAL]] common sense ? sending a drone over any populated area is both illegal and dangerous . give him a hefty fine , disallow any drone operation for [[DATE]] and [[DATE]] in jail
sounds like the chopper ran into the drone - not the drone ran into the chopper
assuming his drone was registered and labeled , could have led to his arrest . unless he was flying over an empty lot , he was flying illegally . not knowing what the designated control area he was in , he could face a few other charges . as a recreation pilot , i am limited to [[CARDINAL]] ' of altitude because i am within [[QUANTITY]] radius of an [[PRODUCT]] and a major airport . [[ORG]] , the [[ORG]] can interrupt your signal and force your drone to land where it 's at .
he 's [[NORP]] ? ha ! the [[ORG]] will do nothing ! ! he will be released and serve no time . funny .
another genius [[NORP]] heard from .
you can vandalyze them . you can set them on fire . but you can not strike them with toy vehicles that cause little to no damage .
[[PERSON]] there are not more incidents like this . have talked to drone salesmen and to drone operators , and it is scary as a pilot to realize how uninformed some are .
[[PERSON]] ? so , we 'll wait until one of these idiots [[ORG]] 's an engine and brings down a plane full of people before it becomes a felony ? they operate at altitudes where real pilots are involved in critical phases of flight and would n't have as much time or altitude to respond to a sudden power loss .
very misleading , the heading appears at [[ORDINAL]] look to be about crashing a helicopter .. it 's clear from the story that it did not crash but " might have " if the drone in question had hit the rotors . there are plenty of rules for drones at the moment , especially if your flying for commercial use . they make no mention of the size or weight of the drone just another " sensational story " . so the drone ran into the helicopter and there was no ill result other then the drone getting smashed .
maybe the police [[PERSON]] moved into the flight path of the drone , thus they were " at fault " . besides , the main rotors would chop those small drones up and not be fazed . the downwash would force the drone away from them anyways .
i get a kick out of all these people claiming that they are doing drone delivery startups . more like drone crash ups . all these delivery drones crashing into each other due to no regulation of airspace .
need to encrypt your onboard data and video i guess
[[ORG]] 's rubber neck may get him some slammer time .
the downdraft from the helicopter 's rotors should have been strong enough to destabilize and prevent the drone from contacting the helicopter .
good ! ! ! it 's about time we all learn that my freedom to fly my drone ends at your aircraft !
[[DATE]] .....
it was clearly the chopper pilots fault .
but was he wearing a mask ?
i have been flying drones for [[DATE]] . no altitude information ? sloppy ?
[[GPE]] is doing away with misdemeanors , so this would not even be a crime there .
did he have his [[ORG]] registration number on the outside of the drone ? apparently not since they had to find him by pictures in the camera . so why was he not charged with not having the number on the vehicle ?
so who 's to say the copter did n't hit the drone ?
well , if the [[ORG]] would have been as aggressive with [[PERSON]] and hunters situation ...
[[PERSON]] seems to be a nice fellow , even though several people have said it was nepotism that got his son on [[ORG]] . i 'm sure he is qualified however the thing most striking is that he appears to being loosing all his testosterone and looks like an old woman . do you feel me ?
“ the pilot was n't able to avoid the drone and had to land after the collision . ” the helicopter hit the drone ? and they are charging the drone flyer with “ … [[CARDINAL]] count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft … ” ?
here i thought [[GPE]] abolished misdemeanors , bail , jail , and fines . apparently , ca and ny have only abolished them for " people of color " .
seriously , you make a vehical capable of entering a specialized normally never thought of medium such as the sky and unintentional incidents are going to occur . i 'd like to know if this drone had the required equipment to be in this airspace and why it was sold if it did n't . i do n't think jail time should be on the table . he admitted fault and did n't intentionally do this .
i guess the drone was not big enough to register with the [[ORG]] or he failed to do so .
vote for pedro
if they put the remaining parts of the drone in a sock and beat him with it a clear message will be sent .
this is what sactuary cities bring to the table . nice ! great job pedro
that 's not accurate friend . i spent [[DATE]] in the military serving our country . my team and i , [[CARDINAL]] of times , ran from cover to jump onboard hovering helio 's , and never got pushed town by the wind force . in fact , i would sprint out and kneel under the blades and hand signal each of my men one by one when clear , to race out and jump aboard the bird . i also have noticed that these drones are getting quite considerly large . have you noticed how many people are complaining of their privacy being violated by said drones ?
[[PERSON]] ( if that 's his real name ? ) to knock out any vehicles [[ORG]] uses in an attempt to [[ORG]] !
how big was this drone ?
the helicopter was the danger ! not the drone !
[[PERSON]] voted for [[GPE]] , then told her that his drone just rammed her limo . [[ORG]] had to wrestle him to the ground .
great . now we 're going to let the government tell us when we can or ca n't fly drones . the nanny state grows ...
cops ! ! you should be able to fly a drone wherever you want . this is america ! the land of the free ! we need a legal defence fund for this guy .
if [[NORP]] had their way and the police were defunded , this incident would have never happened . unless social workers fly helicopters that is .
" investigators identified [[ORG]] based on camera footage taken by the drone . " facial recognition . double whammy . skate dogs ai n't gon na like that .
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] , out of [[CARDINAL]] drone strikes between 64–116 non - combatant deaths occurred . " drones by [[PERSON]] enforcement and the military will only increase , as these little birds get more advanced on range , carry payload , and transferability on signals which will be transferred mid - flight by new technology . the private sector , as in many weapons on the public market may see massive restriction on the use of drones and their actually flight and technology ranges . do as i say and not as i do aspect .
clearly was intentional . [[ORG]] collisions are extremely rare ... think about it ... so much airspace .
maybe they should arrest the helicopter pilot for crashing into the man 's drone
sounds to me like the police helicopter hit the drone , not the other way around ! if [[PERSON]] was operating the drone at an altitude consistent with the parameters set by the [[ORG]] for drone operation he should sue the police for damages to his drone and recover !
soon , there wo n't be a reason for police helicopters . [[NORP]] are defunding police and helicopters are expensive . and , no point of catching the perp , the [[NORP]] want to do away with prisons . https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blm-pressures-democrats-breathe-act-prison-abolition https://www.foxnews.com/us/bail-reform-laws-let-alleged-criminals-back-on-the-streets-within-hours-threatening-public-security
there 's always a few trying to ruin it for everyone ... for those of us who make video productions these drones are a fantastic tool , but they need to be used with common sense , respect for others privacy and strict adherence to the regs pertaining to their operation .
a little sensational saying if a drone hits the rotor it could have brought it down . and what was the altitude ? lots left out of the story . i remember when i lived out there a police helicopter was overhead all the time , felt like an invasion of privacy ... of course that was before cell phones made " privacy " a dead word .
[[ORG]] will let him out .
america the reactive society . all will change when inevitably the sad day comes where a drone flies into a ascending or descending passenger airliner with [[CARDINAL]] + passengers on board and crashes with no survivors . then [[GPE]] will go into mass hysteria mode and draconian laws will be imposed . how do i know ? it has happened before .
i wish they had stated the altitude of the collision .
hernandez ( [[DATE]] ) should sue . that helicopter had no business invading his airspace .
[[ORG]] headline news : a drone hits a helicopter . why is [[ORG]] ignoring a national scandal that is [[CARDINAL]] times greater than [[EVENT]] ? [[ORG]] is now part of the left media ! why is [[ORG]] not reporting this : " the dominion voting software company agreed to testify before the [[ORG]] committee [[DATE]] , and then they did not show up ! if they are innocent , why would they not testify ? "
the govmint restricting more freedoms . not surprising at all .
[[ORG]] needs to get the [[ORG]] to layout air space regulations for homeowners . these things are sophisticated [[DATE]] , can be purchased and flown by anyone , legally or illegally and can violate your safety and every kind of privacy , you think you have in your home . states need to extend their [[PRODUCT]] to include defending from drone trespassing through your property 's air space . homeowners should have the right to destroy unauthorized drones flying below [[QUANTITY]] through their air space boundaries . crashing into helicopters is only the beginning ...
[[DATE]] ? should be [[CARDINAL]]
intentional or not , this is going to continue to happen . this guy should be the unfortunate fool who has to be made an example of . he needs a little time behind bars which might deter other fools from doing the same thing in the future .
mr. [[PERSON]] will just use the " [[PERSON]] james comey defense " - ' i had no intent to cause any harm ' - and will walk away after the charges are dropped , right ?
why was n't the helicopter pilot arrested for [[CARDINAL]] count of unsafe operation of a manned aircraft ?
no doubt la police looking for corona rule breakers
yes , it 's a hazard to flight operations , but it did n't hit the main or tail rotors . apparently a police chopper was damaged and needed significant repairs after a drone hit the fuselage ? does n't sound right .
another [[NORP]] with no brains .
" the criminal case is believed to be the [[ORDINAL]] in the nation stemming from a drone collision . " " who " believes that ?
the accused needs to say that he was helping to defund the police .
and the government controls the air space . not to be a smart ask , but why was this chopper in the air ? how is it government gets to control air space that is not connected with any airport , flight patterns or secure areas ? the fact is , if a drone operator crashes into property on the ground , or in the air , he should simply be responsible for damages . now the government is saying that they own every piece of air space and that also is not true . this drone operator should have as much right to the air space as the lapd and if the [[ORG]] would have crashed into the drone , they should be responsible for damages . who gave the government control over the air space ? did we , the people ? or did they just take it upon themselves to claim all rights over it ?
he sounds [[NORP]] .... he 'll get thre death penalty for sure .
ban drones - they ’re noisy and an invasion of our privacy
he has more than the feds to worry about , just like you damage a police cruiser , there 's jail , restitution and fines he is facing . he 'll be out of jail in [[TIME]] and will be going across the border to escape prosecution .
[[PERSON]] supporter . thought he was doing sleepy [[PERSON]] a favor as a [[NORP]] terrorist [[CARDINAL]] .
[[NORP]] are stupid .
drones are a security risk . there are not sufficient safeguards in place .
lapd charged after helicopter his man 's drone .
he woke up deliberately stupid or he let it build up during [[DATE]] .
of course it 's a [[NORP]]
" criminal case alleging unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft may be [[ORDINAL]] in the nation " .. a dubious honor ... .. or as he said .. " what drone " .. ?
let him spend some time in the slammer see he can see up close " what 's going on "
has [[GPE]] bailed him out yet ?
which machine hit which machine ?
drones are really cool ! the sad thing is that there will always be some joker that messes that up for everyone else ! if you are going to fly , register your drone if it weights [[CARDINAL]] grams . then follow the rules ! it 's that simple .
since the drone is now disabled , i suppose it can find itself a career as a network anchor .
[[PERSON]] nobody has n't used [[CARDINAL]] for some sort of attack or assasination attempt yet !
oh my . where are the liberals demanding a drone ban ? people do n't kill , drones do . there is no [[LAW]] provision protecting the right to own a drone ? what if you arm the drone with a gun ? is it protected then ?
i love the article on [[PRODUCT]] ..... originally titled [[PERSON]] ( clueless ) where people ( liberals ) who survived the crash blame the plane instead of the low info . pilots . why did n't we have that problem in the [[GPE]] ? so [[ORG]] had to dumb down their software to make it easier to handle for those poorly trained and educated foreign pilots .
sign of the beast
well cry me a river .
a year in jail will do him good ... or not .
it should be a felony . he could have caused the death of all on board the helicopter . [[DATE]] is too light for a lefty , let alone a foreign invader . give him [[CARDINAL]] .
turns out that liberal [[NORP]] are drones ... drone : [[CARDINAL]] that lives on the labors of others : parasite .
in ca ? good thing that was a white drone.otherwise it would be police abuse hitting the drone like that .
listening to the grossly ill - informed and irrational hatred of drones displayed here you 'd think people were talking about president [[PERSON]]
charge him with the chopper repairs .
was it a dji mini or a [[ORG]] drone ? as a life long helicopter pilot i would support life without parole , if mr hernandez was truly negligent or trying to ram the helicopter . the story fails to provide sufficient details to arrive at a decision . if the [[ORG]] copter was flying at tree top level at a high rate of speed and hit the drone over mr [[ORG]] 's property , i 'd go with [[GPE]] . if the drone was above [[QUANTITY]] over the surface , i go with lapd . over [[DATE]] i 've seen a lot of [[PERSON]] and oh58 's ( [[PERSON]] ) make contact with trees , ground and a bunch of other objects ( and animals / birds ) and most of the time the aircraft brings it 's crew home . during single pilot operation i would be a lot more concerned about an object or bird coming through the windshield that the rotor system .
indicting this drone flyer with [[CARDINAL]] - count of " unsafe operation of an unmanned drone " is a wimpy charge that assures even more severe consequences of reckless drone operation . if a licensed pilot operated an aircraft in manner that collided ever so slightly with a police helocopter and forced it to land he would be in a hell of lot more trouble and likely lose his pilot 's license . all drone - operators who fly a drone over 250 ' in the air should be required to be licensed and carry liability insurance . some training in [[ORG]] flight rules should be required and even perhaps demonstrated drone piloting capability . dones capabible of flying higher than [[CARDINAL]] ' should only be sold to licensed drone operators . these drones are more than mere toys as they have the capacity to cause substancial property damage and personal injury and they have the potential to intentionally inflict significant harm .
" up to a year " is actually pretty lenient for how horrible to accident could have gone ... the drone gets pulled into the rotors taking down the officers incident and potentially bringing a helicopter crash into a populated and crowded part of [[GPE]] . offender would do best to smile , nod , apologize constantly , and take his lumps .
do n't personal drones have a [[PERSON]] ceiling they can fly ? just have the helicopter stay above that . problem solved .
breaking news . [[ORG]] just announced new health care ! ! ! its covers more than obamacare , costs less and you can keep your own doctors . ha ha ha .... [[DATE]] and we never heard the secret ' beautiful plan '
" [[PERSON]] " wonder where he is from .
the people defending this idiot drone " pilot " who interfered with an active police operation boggle my mind .
[[ORG]] obviously is not informed . was his drone [[ORG]] registered ? ? ? well known requirement among drone pilots .... except for him , obviously . i hope enforcement realizes he is the exception ... and not the rule . drone flight is ( now ) heavily regulated and most fly legally and safely .
with these drones getting larger and able to carry more payload , i wonder how long it will be before some terrorist group attaches explosives to one of these things and intentionally runs it into an aircraft ? ? ?
they ’ll want to ban all private ownership of drones just because of a few bad apples.~the liberal way
apartment dwellers ruin everything
it was bound to happen .
[[PERSON]] fly ’s his drone in the basement
boy , i have seen some pretty stupid and uninformed comments on this thread . [[ORDINAL]] , drones for some time now are regulated under [[ORG]] rule part [[CARDINAL]] and must maintain a certain distance from people , buildings or ........ other aircraft . furthermore , a drone that runs into or is struck by a [[ORDINAL]] responder aircraft to an incident ca n't sue the lapd . for the drone operator it 's called see and avoid . he violated both [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] laws . most likely he will get a letter of reprimand and a lecture from the [[ORG]] and a [[ORG]] flight standards inspector .
does the world 's [[ORDINAL]] french latino , [[PERSON]] , have any [[ORG]] ties ?
why were n't the police arrested for crashing into his drone ? ...... does this mean if i 'm parked in my car and a cop car hits me , i get arrested ?
interesting ..... so , i do nt need stinger missiles ? i just need a $ [[MONEY]] drone , good to know when the civil war kicks off .
to date -- out of [[MONEY]] of drone flights conducted globally -- not even one fatality or serious injury has ever been attributed to a civilian drone striking a manned aircraft and if / when it finally does ? it will mean the odds of it happening again are one in many , many [[CARDINAL]] of flights . meanwhile , if you live in the [[GPE]] the odds of your being struck by lightning in your lifetime are exponentially higher at [[CARDINAL]] in [[CARDINAL]]
cops should use [[CARDINAL]] of these things equipped with weapons for the next liberal ' protest '
not that it matters legally , but you wonder if they considered that the helicopter might have run into the hovering drone ?
they sure it was n’t reckless driving by the helicopter pilot ? i mean how powerful was this drone that it could withstand downward rotor wash .
i think this was a trial run for gangs to test the feasibility of using a drone against a police or other helicopter . a new terrorist weapon . think of it as a cheap guided missile . you know an airliner is next . this should be life in prison !
speaking of the [[NORP]] latino , i was in the military with a redheaded [[NORP]] . [[CARDINAL]] i 've ever seen .
it might not be the criminal charges that the guy regrets most . i assume he will get some kind of unsupervised probation unless there is more to him than this . but , the restitution or the civil suit for repairs to the helicopter may last way longer than criminal charges . at [[CARDINAL]] for an [[ORG]] mechanic .... ouch .
hernandez deserves jail time for this .
guess who is headed to [[ORG]] soon !
why was the helicopter flying low enough to be hit by a drone . even the federal government should respect property rights which do extend upwards x amount of feet , which is high enough to stop unwanted aircraft noise .
it probably was n't intentional , but it 's reckless .
no way someone in [[GPE]] was arrested . they just do n't do that there . fake news !
sounds like [[GPE]] man is giving [[GPE]] man some competition ......
so being a nosy [[PERSON]] had consequences this time ...
we enjoy freedom and the liberties that gives us . freedom does not absolve anyone from their responsibility while exercising those liberties .
they need to require licenses for drones and they need to ban flying them in residential neighborhoods . some moron was flying one in my backyard and looking in windows with it . tossed a football at it and knocked it out of the air then crushed it up . when he knocked on the door asking for it , i told him you ’re going to have to call the pd . if you involve them i ’m going to pursue peeping tom charges against you ...
probably was intentional .
why should this surprise anyone ? as an ex - faa lawyer , i can tell you that just about anyone could see the potential for mischief and tragedy that these drones are capable of causing . they have been operated near airports and have almost caused crashes . these drones in the hands of amateurs are an accident\tragedy waiting to happen . sure , most people are responsible but others are not . aircraft are most vulnerable during take - off and ascent from the airport and on short final approach to landing . that is exactly where a drone flying in restricted airspace too near an airport will be .
[[DATE]] i saw a car on an interstate highway being driven way too fast for the blizzard conditions . sure enough , he lost traction on a slight curve and slid right into the corner of a state patrol car on the shoulder . nothing serious , but i m sure the officer was not amused . but a drone hitting a police copter ... that 's an ah - sheet moment .
i foresee more incidents similar to this in the future . i 'm surprise this is the [[ORDINAL]] of its kind .
take his green card and send back to [[GPE]]
since the civilian drone market exploded [[DATE]] there have literally been [[CARDINAL]] of drone flights around the world and to date : not even one fatality or serious injury has ever been attributed to a civilian drone striking a manned aircraft
you 're just mad that a [[DATE]] hispanic guy can afford to live in [[GPE]] and you 're stuck in the south
[[ORG]] places a [[QUANTITY]] ceiling on remote controlled aircraft . if the drone was above [[QUANTITY]] it was the drone pilot 's fault . if below , then the drone pilot did nothing wrong . but the drone does need to give right - of - way to a manned aircraft - it the drone pilot saw the heli in time .
the helicopter obviously crashed into drone but helicopter and planes should have tech that disrupt drone signals within mile so can not happen . i would love to have a drone to fly around but not willing to pay the consequences . how do you prevent collisions if you go above where allowed . drones have to be registered also from my understanding .
it 's tough . i own drones and i love them . i try to be extra careful
[[PERSON]] ? the [[ORDINAL]] [[NORP]] latino ?
i do have one issue with this .... how exactly did the drone hit the body of the [[PERSON]] after going through the prop wash ... ? ? ? there is a huge prop rotating at a speed to lift thousands of pounds creating a downdraft that people have a hard time over coming when walking under it , and yet we are to believe a drone of a pound or [[CARDINAL]] flies right through it ... it would be like a humming bird flying over an outside air conditioner condenser .... shoots straight up ... as the drone would shoot straight down ....
[[PERSON]] . this is n't the [[ORDINAL]] time but it is insanely rare when you consider there are [[CARDINAL]] of drone flights inside the [[GPE]] every year in [[DATE]] an army [[PRODUCT]] struck a small drone over [[LOC]] that resulted in a main rotor blade suffering a minor nick
rotor blades do n't like thier balance to have an upset . do nt be a jerk . give bigger air craft the right of way and learn a few 9f the fars .
the [[ORG]] should save some money and use a drone to due the same job .
how big was this drone ?
usual lies and misrepresentations . copters could not safely fly at all if a bird hit to the fuselage or rotor caused significant damage . the little drone is mostly plastic and masses less than many birds . it disgusts me how lies are used to legitimize restrictions . the pilot definitely did not need to land , just did to make the incident appear significant .
i would sue the lapd for crashing into my drone , let [[CARDINAL]] citizens decide .
the senseless , and racist , slaughter of drones going about their business is more proof we need to defund police .
[[ORDINAL]] of all the [[ORG]] helicopter crashed into the drone , not the other way around .
i feel it is the same as when some [[CARDINAL]] robs a person with a gun .. fires off a round and misses the victim because he is a bad shot he should not be booked for assault with a deadly weapon .. smhs period
if the headline has the word [[GPE]] in it ... it 's going to be about stupid people .
may the odds be ever in your favor : there are [[CARDINAL]] registered drones in the [[GPE]] and [[CARDINAL]] registered drone operators which equates to [[ORG]] of civilian drone flights [[DATE]] that means that statistically you are more likely to be struck by lightning ( 1:700,000 annually or [[CARDINAL]] in your lifetime ) than see a little privately own drone hit a manned aircraft so , meh
well if he 's black look for more rioting
why did the lapd pilot murder the innocent drone ? drone lives matter ! ! ! time to loot [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] !
should owe a huge fine . hate those things , spying on people !
a lot melodramatic . there is no way a little baby drone can do enough damage to a helicopter main rotor system " to bring it down " . [[DATE]] as a [[ORG]] helo pilot , i know of what i speak
that guy should do some real time . he could have killed that pilot .
if he 's [[ORG]] / or a [[PERSON]] supporter he 'll suffer no consequences that s for sure
it 's [[GPE]] 's fault . they should have sent in a social worker instead of a helicopter unit .
* police car turns on lights and floors it on the highway * * slams into a slower moving vehicle obeying the traffic laws * " you could have killed me ! jail for you . " remember guys .. this is [[GPE]] .
another terrible article written by [[ORG]] . the article [[ORDINAL]] says the drone was " crashed into " the helicopter . that suggests a deliberate action on the part of the operator . on the other hand , the drone camera was recovered and it had pictures of the operator . it is doubtful that he intentionally crashed his drone into the helicopter . in the hurry to bring this to our attention [[ORDINAL]] , we got a story that is more a collection of loose ends than of fact . i suspect that the drone operator will be found responsible . and should be .
was he checking it out out to see if they could start looting the stores ?
hilarious that the drone 's camera footage is what caught the guy . there 's an amusing [[ORG]] episode where the drone owner misbehaves on camera to his eventual dismay .
drones ! since the dawn of time , compelled to live their sheltered lives . not once has anyone ever seen such a rise of pure hypocrisy !
great ! just when you thought things could n't get worse , now we have illegal aliens with drones
did the drone hit the helicopter or did the helicopter hit the drone ? the drone could have been just flying around being a good little drone when the police helicopter assaulted it .
there are pretty clear and detailed regulations for [[ORG]] ( small unmanned aircraft systems - faa parlance for “ drones ” ) and people need to get nailed for not following them . these things are n’t toys . they need to be operated responsibly , not like most doofuses out there operate cars and everything else . this underscores why ill never support having “ flying cars ” without requiring the operators to hold a pilot certificate - the last thing we need is imbeciles inserting themselves into the national airspace system like they ’ve done with our highway and roadway system . some competence and “ skin in the game ” is required .
they charge the guy with the drone who caused minimum damage but they do n't charge the looters , rioters who caused major damage .
idiot ! this is what gives drones a bad name . any drone pilot knows that if a helicopter or low flying aircraft is in the area that you immediately land the drone .
if this rubbernecker using technology , to get his fix while satisfying his desire for witnessing mayhem , were the owner of a social media platform , and in violation censorship laws , or a governor , violating covid regulations , that he imposed on society , all he would need to utter , in his defense , is gee , i am so sorry , what i did was reckless , and i was n't thinking . please forgive me ! any liberal judge would throw out the offense , and close the case for ever .
" the pilot was n't able to avoid the drone , " seems to me the pilot was at fault .
probably a look out for the burglars .
ban drones . they are more dangerous than weapons when in the hands of liberals .
what do i think ? i think there are a lot of really stupid people who have no common sense at all . flying a drone near a police helicopter is as stupid as driving you car near a police vehicle in code [[CARDINAL]] .
all things considered he was being a good citizen and recording a crime scene . not really different in principle from recording a crime in progress on your phone . i 'm glad nobody was injured and hope the court goes easy on this guy .
hitting the main rotor probably would not have brought the helicopter down . if he hit the tail rotor the pilot would have lost control .
only good thing about these gizmos is for them it 's always hunting season . free clay pigeon here !
this does not happen in [[DATE]] after [[PERSON]] defunds the police .
teach the drone operator a lesson , off with his arms !
another ca nut job shows his true intelligence
" unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft " this could easily happen if the pilots of both aircraft were operating as safe as possible . police and news helicopters do n't file " flight plans " and do n't fly in a linear fashion . they change direction and altitude at will — so long as they avoid fixed - wing aircraft " lanes " . all aircraft — including drones — should be required to have ads - b transponders . that way they can all be tracked and identified in real time . simple inexpensive ads - b based warning systems can be implemented to avoid collisions .
drones lives matter . throw the book at him .
why not attempted manslaughter ?
fox headline news = a drone . why are they not reporting this : the dominion voting software company agree to testify before the [[ORG]] committee [[DATE]] , and then they did not show up ! if they are innocent , why would they not testify ?
no different than damaging something with a car .
people show their stupidity [[DATE]] .
it 's a [[ORDINAL]] misdemeanor offense of this type , so i bet he 'll get a suspended sentence with probation and fine .
it is more likely the helicopter hit the drone . in fact , it is more likely that the helicopter was flying too low at the time it hit the drone .
if you can hit a [[ORG]] , a 12ga will take out a drone .
officer i here illegally ..... i can go now? ...... oh sure why did n't you just say so
he should claim to be an illegal immigrant protesting police brutality , he 'll be free by [[TIME]]
so if this is the first i hope they bring the hammer down and make sure everyone knows about it . maybe if they had taken talking / texting while driving a little more seriously in the beginning it would n't have become the killer it did .
give him a punishment we will never forget . take away his smart phone and restrict him to a land line .
so the [[ORG]] easily found this guy accidentally flying a drone into a chopper but they can not find [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] burning looting our cities ? ? ? really defund the crooked [[ORG]] ! by the way what ever happened to the [[ORG]] investigation ? ? ?
uh - oh , the drone pilot has a [[NORP]] surname . and true to form , you see the racist remarks in the comments below .
finally , [[CARDINAL]] of these dangerous geeks gets arrested .
[[PERSON]] = keep the wall up ..
if they defunded the police , they could n't afford a helicopter and potentially dangerous accidents like this could n't happen .
should n't police use drones to see what is going on instead of helicopters ?
if he really did it on purpose he should be charged with a felony , just like throwing rocks at cars off a bridge . if he did not do it on purpose it would be hard to prove that he did . depending on how high he was he could be in trouble with the [[ORG]] as well .
sorry , but most [[NORP]] have enough trouble just driving cars ( legally ) , no way he could be an expert drone operator . lucky pilot . drones are becoming crucial to land surveying and agriculture , but recreation use can too easily be abused . like pot .
but burning and looting businesses is okay ?
" the misdemeanor offense ... " this should be a felony punishable by [[DATE]] hard time . maybe that would be enough time for him to learn responsibility for his actions , but i doubt it .
it is important to prosecute these cases to help prevent disasters . those who are licensed to fly drones know the dangers and risks they could pose . prosecute every single one .
another one of [[GPE]] 's dreamers .
" authorities do not believe [[PERSON]] intentionally caused the drone to ram the copter . " so ... it was an accident ? sort of like if he clipped a police car ... accidentally ? maybe his attorney should trot out the [[ORG]] 's " no criminal intent " language used for [[PERSON]] .
this reminds me of the solar plane experiment ..... a light plane with huge wings and body full of solar panels .... and fully charged batteries ...... couldn't even fly [[CARDINAL]] person ..... with strong prevailing winds .... from [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] . it 's called [[WORK_OF_ART]] !
this drone situation is similar to the suv situation in the news media . drone means what ? all sizes and capabilities or a toy ? oh " if he did n't mean anything " okay . we used to have all kinds of suv 's doing things like killing people . how about better reporting ?
i ’m surprised it ’s taken this long ... i said years ago that the time is coming soon when terrorists use drones to deliberately crash commercial aircraft taking off near airports ...
domestic terrisom.prison for life .
[[PERSON]] is a hero finally free of the leftist regime out on bail getting a great thanksgiving meal . thanks [[PERSON]] for doing the right thing !
could be it was no accident but watch out big bro will find a way to make money from this , extra taxes , licensing fees , certifications , training courses .
my son is a corporate pilot and has had [[CARDINAL]] near - misses around lax in [[DATE]] from idiot drone users . all of the events were reported to air traffic control and the [[ORG]] , but it is hard to nab the perpetrators in real time . the yahoos with the drones are putting a lot of lives in jeopardy when they fly in restricted airspace .
this kid is toast .
green new deal will have clear air travel only for [[NORP]] elites .
be read to hear this kinda news more often in the future . we know that members of [[ORG]] do not have enough brains to foresee this coming .
another millennial with too much time on their hands and lack of common sense
he 's a dumb [[NORP]] , so he will get a polite slap on the wrist , and next time , when he brings down a jetliner , all the other dumb [[NORP]] will wonder how in the world it could happen .
this happened in [[GPE]] . that explains everything .
these drones are a menace in populated areas . remember when they proposed delivering packages in cities by drone ? it 's all these alternative snake oil idiots wanting to sell something they saw on a cartoon !
" unsafe operation " ? how about " [[WORK_OF_ART]] ?
he should quit being so damn nosey !
let him be the prisoner who other drone idiots think of before they go flying near aircraft .
" the misdemeanor offense is punishable by [[DATE]] in prison . " well , thank goodness it 's a federal crime and charge where , perhaps , there will be some real or meaningful consequences . [[GPE]] has all but ceased prosecuting misdemeanor offenses , while simultaneously re - classifying many crimes which once were felonies to misdemeanors . oh , and do n't fool yourself into believing for a single moment the criminal element in [[GPE]] is not aware of this change and knows exactly what or how much havoc they can wreak without fear of consequences .
[[GPE]] dreamin' ...... like all those who died in ca from drug overdose . liberals should have learned that lesson .
[[PERSON]] , [[DATE]] , was arrested by [[ORG]] agents [[DATE]] and charged with [[CARDINAL]] count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft . ' unsafe operation of a unmanned aircraft ' this is a weak and lame charge . the officer(s ) on this craft could have been seriously injured if not killed . attempted murder or attempted man slaughter would be a better charge .
he will just be let go ........ the [[NORP]] want no prison !
attempted murder sounds more like it . fry him !
this happens when laws are disorganized or absent altogether . clear concise laws are desperately needed . [[CARDINAL]] ft and below drones are legally protected but must leave the area when emergency aircraft responders are present . emergency responders should have a means to shut down drone signals within a confined localized area . i 'm sure there 's more , better ideas out there but we do n't have any and we badly need them federally uniformly applied .
how big was this drone that it could take down a helicopter . fake news . there was a collision , but no danger . can a suicidal pelican take out a helicopter ?
the guy who remotely controlled the [[ORG]] helicopter did n't see it coming ?
who has the right of way ? as , the drone does not require a radio and the helicopter was below the required altitude , should n't the police helicopter pilot take responsibility for the impact ?
[[ORG]] ? he should be ok .
drones flying drones . charge him for the cost of the accident , police time , aircraft inspection / certification , etc . and send him on his way .
i wonder what the range is on drones . how close does a [[NORP]] operative have to be to [[PERSON]] to operate him ?
the [[NORP]] terrorists will next start attaching bombs to these drones . there may be a point in [[DATE]] that we have to protect the police ourselves . the [[NORP]] will not . they need the votes of these monsters .
how sad ... was the drone okay ? did it survive ? you must repair him ! sir , if any of my circuits or gears will help , i 'll gladly donate them .
