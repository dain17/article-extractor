As an ex-FAA lawyer, I can tell you that just about anyone could see the potential for mischief and tragedy that these drones are capable of causing.  They have been operated near airports and have almost caused crashes.  These drones in the hands of amateurs are an accident\\tragedy waiting to happen.  Sure, most people are responsible but others are not.  Aircraft are most vulnerable during take-off and ascent from the airport and on short final approach to landing.  That is exactly where a drone flying in restricted airspace too near an airport will be.",

Some training in FAA flight rules should be required and even perhaps demonstrated drone piloting capability.
