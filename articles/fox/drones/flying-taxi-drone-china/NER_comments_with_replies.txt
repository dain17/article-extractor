rotarcraft are not ready to fly autonomously !
it can also be used for chopping large salads .
and at mile 21 ? [[GPE]] , we have problem ; we are altitude challenged ! !
with that limited flying time it sounds quite useless so i 'm sure [[GPE]] will adopt it to cut down on surface traffic .
why would it be useless ? a [[QUANTITY]] range could let you hope across the sprawl of [[GPE]] in [[TIME]] [[TIME]] to drive that same [[QUANTITY]] .
" the company claims the autonomous flight technology eliminates any chance of failure caused by human error . " except it 's made in china ! !
the [[DATE]] [[PERSON]] .
it also doubles as a coffin in case of an accident .
they said that about the iron horse as well .
but the iron horse usually was n't self burying .
[[QUANTITY]] payload so [[PERSON]] has to wait for the [[CARDINAL]] - seat version .
this used to be called a helicopter
wonder what the noise factor is
what ? what did you say ?
a small drone makes a lot ofnoise ... this is a lot bigger ... they fly low ... now multiply that many more drones ... just wondering
[[ORG]] ... as if i were sitting next to you in the drone .
unfortunately it can also go from [[CARDINAL]] to [[CARDINAL]] with [[CARDINAL]] mistake .... i 'll take the bus
make them in [[GPE]] and call them a batmobile ! that 'll make them so much more popular !
you ca n't sue any one in [[GPE]] so if your legs get chopped off , it 's no chop suey for you .
it has a flight time of [[TIME]]
pefect ! imagine the ground covered in [[GPE]] . all you need . ;)
" the company claims the autonomous flight technology eliminates any chance of failure caused by human error . " there is absolutely nothing you can do in any situation . is that supposed to be reassuring ?
it did not mention the possibility of technology error . . . only human error .
in theory , there should n't be any situations . :-) that said : i 'll wait until version 2.0 .
because of years of regulations , insurance problems , companies in the [[GPE]] have taken a back seat in developing these new technologies
from [[ORG]] .
best comment of [[DATE]] ! ! bravo !
not his . [[PERSON]] , racist , old and untrue . trumptardio be pastin ' .
" the company claims the autonomous flight technology eliminates any chance of failure caused by human error . " humans created everything about this technology : hardware and software " all possible errors are already programmed - in .
would you ride a [[NORP]] motorcycle down the freeway ? then why would you ever step in this ?
all [[GPE]] has done is scale - up current drone technology , which they initially stole from the [[GPE]] to begin with .
interesting innovation . [[NORP]] governments flush with western tech and money . we created a monster by moving our tech and factories to [[GPE]] . you have to trust their leader , because no one else is in charge in a [[NORP]] country . at some point they get a snotty self indulgent leader and the rest will be history as they say .
conveniently has dual use as a decapitator for riot control .
when asked how far these will fly , [[ORG]] stated " all the way to [[ORG]] " .
i can already see someone walking to close to the side and getting sliced and diced .
it 's made in [[GPE]] so it probably wo n't last [[CARDINAL]] or 3 trips if even that far and they wo n't support it if it fails - user error .
helicopters at least can auto rotate down in case of engine failure . if just [[CARDINAL]] of those electric motors blows a fuse it 's going down.hard . no safety net . i doubt they could even use a parachute because the craft would be spinning .
it 's made in [[NORP]] [[GPE]] with stolen technology and [[NORP]] workmanship . it 's a flying coffin in essence .
nothing like being a passenger when the network goes down ( followed by the drone going down ) .
i 'm sure it 's got [[CARDINAL]] - star reviews on both [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] - albeit in broken [[LANGUAGE]] . ah ... thanks , but no thanks .
the problem with these crafts is [[CARDINAL]] little mistake and you fall to your death,,,,unlike your car where you usually walk away unscathed from an accident .
being new tech , the [[CARDINAL]] change i would make for these is to add an emergency chute that deploys in case of emergency .. sad to see [[GPE]] leading the world in this however ...
those with insufficient social credit fall to their deaths through the craft 's trap door ...
made in [[GPE]] . what could go wrong ?
also works for leg amputations and grass trimming .
and feminazi executions of misogynists ...
this " taxi " uses the latest in stolen [[NORP]] digital technology to provide safe and efficient operation ans passenger comfort ( but they have not found the glitch planted by the victims of the theft ) guaranteeing that nothing can possibly go wrong , go wrong , go wrong , go wrong .................. ..... ...
how long until a passenger gets his leg chopped off because he exited the cabin too soon ?
i wonder which [[GPE]] , [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] company they stole the designs from .
