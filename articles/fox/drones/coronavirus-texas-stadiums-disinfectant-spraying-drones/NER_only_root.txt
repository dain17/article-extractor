spray with [[ORG]] laced hand sanitizer
it needs to be pepper spraying drones for all of the rioters .
need to disinfect the rioters as a trial performance . if they scatter and do n't return , then great ! !
now just put something stinky in those drones and fly them around the rioters .
ok . still not going . the [[ORDINAL]] knee i see or [[ORG]] banner i see , i turn the channel too . just did that [[DATE]] for a soccer game .
it 's a nice idea , saw coverage [[DATE]] in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] where they were doing this out in the streets .
cool !
dis infect all you want . bring in the infected people , lost cause . wasted time and money .
you know ... if you filled them full of jet fuel and flew them over [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] you could really disinfect things .
you can make your own r - water substitute simply with pure salt , water , and electricity . it will not disinfect cities , if you wonder .
lets see .. we do n't know what they are spraying just like in the skys and spraying for something we can not test for .. seems legit .
this is a waste of time and resources . you need masks , social distancing , contact tracing , and decent personal hygiene . indoor events with people in close proximity are the problem , and if they are doing anything that 's expelling virus ( singing , sneezing , coughing , breathing too close to each other ) that 's the problem . disinfectant drones are to make you feel safe , but wo n't make you safe .
yeah , sure . your disinfectant is weak nerve agent . and there is no medical proof that nerve gas helped anyone .
does everybody get tested + .. so far [[PERCENT]] .. good luck .
and [[DATE]] from now the sharks will be advertising their services on tv for people who may have caught _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( fill in the blank ) because of the disinfectant .
looking forward to contracts to refurbish stadiums after they spray something all over them that eventually eats up the concrete . you would be surprised what mustard will do to concrete over a [[DATE]] span . it is almost unavoidable that something in this spray has long term detrimental effects on building materials , that is why it is not shipped in metal containers .
maybe the can use these to disinfect [[GPE]]
[[CARDINAL]] drunken [[ORG]] fans yelling for their team will spray more alcohol in [[TIME]] than that drone could spray in [[DATE]] .
if they can disinfect an entire stadium in [[TIME]] , imagine how little time it would take to disperse a [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] riot with the proper " disinfectant "
this is what crowd control will be like in the not so distant future . just think of what could be sprayed from these ... thin down the masses when water and food become scarce .... blame it other things .... keep voting [[NORP]] and it will be here sooner then you think .
this is so cool . like spraying for bugs in the fields with high - performance aircraft . too bad it is useless . coronavirus does not live on surfaces once dry . especially outside . especially exposed to uv light spectrum . but okay if they are spraying alcohol -- just make sure it is ethanol and not methanol or they will be pickling their sports fans .
be amusing if someone confused pesticide , muriatic acid , or any other common chemical for the disinfectant . curious if that would be considered a terrorist act if they somehow started spraying too soon while people are in the stadium .
spraying with what , roundup ? !
all this disinfectant is only going to create super - bugs . stay tuned for the unintended consequences .
now why ca n't they use these on [[ORG]] and antifa ?
[[ORG]] polluting the air may be more dangerous than the virus .
would nâ€™t want nefarious characters to get hold of this , change the spray , and fly around a filled stadium
in [[DATE]] , went with my dad to watch the cowboys in [[EVENT]] .... fantastic ! had gone there to the texas / ou game with him [[DATE]] . we thought we were living in high cotton at [[FAC]] . ( fyi the only time you would have seen the [[DATE]] [[PRODUCT]] kneeling is if the pope came to see them play . ) now we are using drones for everything . hope i live to see the next miracle occur , which would include the [[PERSON]] all moving to [[LOC]] .
photo op . far more efficient to send a few folks around with the [[CARDINAL]] lbs you can carry on your back connected to a wand sprayer . come on . ask obvious questions , " journalists . " like , how would this device carry many pounds of disinfectant ?
you know , it does n't just kill covid-19 and it does n't kill [[PERCENT]] of the germs out there . so what are we doing ? making superbugs that we ca n't treat . all for sports that actually have nothing to do with the students ' education .
wow , even the [[NORP]] are finally catching on to the seriousness of this pandemic .
they could use that same drone to refill my beer cup during the game
wait until all the fans are seated then spray them all down with bleach ... then you will have a lot of dumb blondes .
