we really did n't need to know this . i guess it would be fine to inform us if the development of this weapon is known to countries that are not our allies . but in general , we should not be exposing weapons like this or how far our hyper - sonic research and development has progressed since [[DATE]] .
maintaining a truly " black " program sharply increases it 's cost , and rarely works ( the [[NORP]] knew about the atomic bomb long before the [[NORP]] public did ) . aside from that , there are good policy reasons to ensure the enemy is aware of our capabilities : it makes them feel less confident about attacking us and tends to avoid destabilization when they eventually find out and may be inclined to panic and do something rash .
but it 's fun to watch the public panic and incites actual good new movies .
wonder what this thing uses for fuel ? and how much of that [[QUANTITY]] is batteries ?
gimme dat x - luuv ! !
i 've often wondered why we tip our adversaries off as to our present and future capabilities . sounds like a cool project but with the amount of money involved one would think " loose lips sink ships "
i think it 's a bit of misinformation . [[DATE]] a story about [[GPE]] testing nuclear capable under water drones broke . i ca n't imagine the [[ORG]] would let their capabilities out . i think we do have weapons launch capability and those range numbers are probably a lot higher .
i think it may be for [[GPE]] 's benefit . they may not want to stay on the course they 're on .
test drive a few of these bad boys in the straits of hormuz
why ? [[GPE]] will blow them up and trump will say everything is under control
skynet needs such weapons .
article said it wo n't fit in submarine launch tube . is that a torpedo tube or a missile tube ?
usually with this kind of tech being developed , they make it public and say it 's in the process of being developed , means they are actually testing them in open water as we are commenting on them .. when other countries read this , they think the same and wonder if and where they 're testing them .. makes you really wonder , what if !
[[GPE]] has them already , [[GPE]] is working on them , we are behind on them
negative ghost rider . [[GPE]] ca n't spell " cat " beside our [[ORG]] . have you seen [[GPE]] 's aircraft carriers , lol ?
you mean that one with the turned up nose , they got from [[GPE]]
right , lol . happy [[ORDINAL]]
[[GPE]] / status [[CARDINAL]] auv torpedo , tested once for like [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] , [[GPE]] 's is still on drawing board , [[GPE]] already has some , the orca is the newest , largest auv .. already have them , just making them bigger and more advanced .. [[CARDINAL]] yrs of obama defunding this sort of advancement slowed us a little , but advancing quickly , compared to the other [[CARDINAL]] ..
we have much more than that .
yep
thought this was a story of [[PERSON]] getting taught to swim underwater
rosie only attacks food .
i remember when [[PERSON]] threatened star wars ( satellite system ) and that caused [[GPE]] to collapse because they did n't have the economic strength to compete with it . then [[PERSON]] did n't have to do star wars or spend any money on it . victory with no shots fired .
unbelievable ! amazing technology . unlike air drones there are so many technological limitations under sea .
let 's not show our hand now ! ;)
no wonder [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] are [[NORP]] rattling . the [[GPE]] has a new toy .
this seems about as smart as making a [[ORG]] the size of a [[PRODUCT]] . would n't making [[CARDINAL]] much smaller , ship / sub deploy - able craft make a lot more sense ?
depends on if you need range / staying power .
problem is , the [[ORDINAL]] time one gets damaged or sinks [[GPE]] will find , steal and copy it . put a self - destruct circuit in it !
i am sure it has a scuttle command .
i found this a hilarious typo : " ... senor carrying capacity ... " the author clearly forgot the tilde .
lol ...
have they not seen that this is how we get [[GPE]] ....
makes sense to me ! !
[[ORG]] !
lol [[NORP]] already did it , unlucky cowboys
this is old the military has had these machines since [[DATE]] . what 's really interesting is the sonic and microwave tech . imagine useing a weapon that can render convoy unconscious and unable to stabilize a equilibrium essentially shutting down an opponent . using weapons like this one could destroy an enemy while leaving valuable equipment intact to then be repurposed and turned on an enemy combatants . you take away a soldier 's ability to fight and resist and render them useless the day is won and the battle is yours . .
sounds like a dream job
[[PERSON]] ran his mouth about all these imaginary super - weapons and it bought him an [[NORP]] roll out of real ones .
this is a media driven counter punch to [[GPE]] 's new hyper drive missile test . frankly , until [[PERSON]] 's or [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] reports openly about [[NORP]] weapon systems capability , i do n't believe it .
i m guessing it would have to go shallow for attack . ca nt have armed equipment like that completely autonomous , too much liability if it mistakes a cruise ship for a enemy warship .
calculations precise . ai driven software insures that a friendly ship has a [[PERSON]] that is recognizable . if a ship is in the path and not producing a certain radar frequency . it is marked for attach . this also makes the unmanned sub susceptible [[CARDINAL]] enemy manipulation .
this thing better be hacker - proof .
could it pop up beside a [[NORP]] warship and threaten a collision ?
at quick glance i can imagine armed drones with long range and long loiter on station capability being deployed on semi - autonomous missions using pre - planned profiles under the watch of qualified undersea drone pilots from shore initially , quickly from sea bases and eventually from both aircraft and independent forward based small operators . they could be programmed to go out on a patrol or other mission , execute and return to base for maintenance , refueling and rearming , just like any submarine would be . combine that with offensive orbit and lunar based bases and we could give new meaning to the ' [[ORG]] ' concept .
meanwhile , in other news , inner city schools are failing .
on the whole ... the [[GPE]] educational system has been and continues to fall behind many other developed nations . esp in science and math . we 're not top [[CARDINAL]] any longer .
that should be a state issue .
yes , every [[GPE]] state has the same problem
you can thank the liberals for the failing indoctrination centers .
meanwhile - muh [[GPE]] !
[[CARDINAL]] of americas top secret ...... wait ....
sweet ! i feel better when all our military branches get cool new weapons !
" able to reach depths of [[QUANTITY]] " that 's what makes it special . it can skim the bottom where sonar ca n't discriminate it from the sea bottom . that thing has to be nuclear powered . if that 's true , the only thing from keeping it from ranging the entire oceans would be communications , that is not allowing it to go without monitoring for too long . park one of these on the sea bottom just outside the dardanelles or sevastapol , and the [[GPE]] would get lots of intelligence on [[NORP]] submarines that might escape satellite monitoring .
[[ORG]] radio would allow them to stay in contact like they do with our current submarine fleet . it is just a very slow form of communication , but it would work .
frequencies that can be used for worldwide communication are prone to interference . the lower the frequency , the lower the data carrying capacity of the channel . the range limitation is probably still for communication .
[[GPE]] news item naming the program and builders . they 'll now be targeted by every spy network on the planet ; and [[GPE]] will build a copy before we do .
the biggest limitation to a sub is the crew ... mainly the need to feed them . if you do n't have the need for a crew , berthing , and feeding , a nuclear version of [[CARDINAL]] of these could remain underwater patrolling for [[DATE]] without ever having to surface .
maintenance .
in other words ... do n't forget world that we got [[CARDINAL]] undetectabe subs out there with nuclear that can sizzle rogue countries like an [[GPE]] drive - by .
lol [[GPE]] is a rouge country [[PERSON]]
" like an [[GPE]] drive by " was a metaphor , but you do raise a point worthy of further discusion .
so long as the name tag does n't say [[GPE]] , i 'm good .
my thoughts on the same path .
and here we go leaving [[GPE]] in the dust ... again .
arm it with a nuclear self - destruct device and send it into [[NORP]] waters . if the [[NORP]] capture it , wait until they get it back to port & then blow it up along with the ship that captured it and the base full of their top scientists waiting to take it apart and reverse engineer it . that 'll teach them a valuable lesson !
what ever happened to keeping certain things secret ? why let our enemies know what weapons we have ? did n't trump mention this kind of thing when he was campaigning ?
is it conceivably possible that trump and his admin and military are using disinformation tactics in some way to strengthen our position ? hypothetical example , this technology is already [[DATE]] . do you really think [[PERSON]] is going to show his hand before all the cards are on the table ?
the [[NORP]] [[DATE]] announced the existance of " dooms day drone subs " to wipe out costal cities with mega tonnes of nukes . perhaps this is the type of secrets not being disclosed .
saw this on [[WORK_OF_ART]] . episode : the doomsday machine .
[[PERSON]] ! that was my favorite episode , that and balance of terror .
yeah ... gotta say ... balance of terror was great .
hey good choices . i ’m fond of arena ( the gorn ) , [[GPE]] , and that one with dr. [[PERSON]] and his [[CARDINAL]] computer .
would you trust it if it were running on [[ORG]] network equipment ?
our professor told us about under water wave 's and that ocean life rides on them but when they collide they can crush things like water hammers ! the ocean is dangerus !
sounds like your boat hit a rock .
interesting comment . i automatically start hearing [[WORK_OF_ART]] " theme song while reading it !
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] ... [[PERSON]] ya right out " !
what could possibly go wrong ....
betting against [[ORG]] and voting for a [[ORG]] . otherwise , [[ORG]] will succeed and this new weapon will too ! maga .
we can build drones but ca n’t build a capable small ship . we invest in [[ORG]] , a small littoral ship , which only has an offensive weapon radius of [[QUANTITY]] . even [[NORP]] speedboats have longer range weapons , and do n’t cost [[MONEY]] . an old [[ORG]] class [[ORG]] had harpoon missiles and a [[QUANTITY]] gun with as much reach as a cruiser or a [[ORG]]
[[PERSON]] carrying capacity of [[QUANTITY]] ! that 's [[CARDINAL]] tall [[NORP]] !
i 'll bet they see all kinds of never seen before stuff . i bet that would be tricky to navigate undersea channels unless they have cameras on the nose .
could someone please change [[ORG]] ’s diapers . looks like that is the real cause of his bad attitude .
i think i ’ll be dead be skynet takes over ...... thankfully . i used to think that movie was out there . not so much anymore .
stay in front or be eaten ; a fact of life .
the [[ORDINAL]] paragraph says it has " senor carrying capacity " . does that mean it is transporting [[NORP]] ?
i bet the [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] and others will be quite surprised by this secret weapon . ( unless they look at news articles . )
i say shoot [[ORDINAL]] , ask questions later . then we 'll see how surprised our adversaries really are .
i am curious about secure communications with this . real time communications seems impossible . i see this tech landing in the hands of our enemies .
[[NORP]] human intelligence is the best in the world . this equipment will be unstoppable by foreign intelligence hackers , in my opinion .
[[ORG]] and [[ORG]] are used to communicate globally with submerged vessels . transmissions are [[CARDINAL]] way and very slow but can be effective . for example a short string of characters ( such as an [[ORG]] ) can represent a much longer instruction located in a book or database accessible to both .
god bless [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and our military . peace through strength . that is a weapon that ought to deter even the most ignorant of our adversaries . i really want to to see our military use it 's force , but only if it can be used as judiciously as possible , protecting innocent civilians while destroying the leadership and military of our adversaries .
way to go . tell everyone what we have and what we are working on . we are so stupid .
if they 're talking about it , they 're already doing it and have already built a defense system to beat one like it .
if the news is reporting it being built , rest assured , it 's already in the water doing its job .
afterward , we 'll tie all these drones to a central computer . we 'll call it [[GPE]] .
why do we tell everyone what we are doing and all the basic tech specs . why do we give out any information other than we are building [[CARDINAL]] undersea drones . we should keep all our enemies guessing until we need to use it on them . we only need to tell them enough to let them know we have new advanced weapons . that s it . of course they will more than likely just steal the plans from us via breaking into our systems and then build the same thing or better for [[CARDINAL]] the costs . another area we need to advance our ability is stopping countries from breaking into our government systems as well as contractor systems of the government . lots of problems to fix .
cool ! !
[[PERSON]] 2025 !
no a torpedo , as some seem to think , but a platform , which can launch torpedoes / cruse missiles , and/or smaller drones , both air and water , survey defensive staging , likely lay mines , map geology/ topography , coastal and underwater , lay in wait on station for long periods , and [[DATE]] , become part of a laser defense / offense line / grid . they might also be used as air defense stations , even doing escort for surface boats / fleets , as outriders and advance warning sensors . some of these might also deliver [[ORG]] , or pick up personnel from littoral waters or at sea , as well as be used to recover downed airmen or even sailors of damaged boats . once the hull and drive manufacturing is in place , the platform can become an ad hoc design , if needed , and the numbers of successful types can be increased to form " pods " that operate as singulars , as needed , or come together for what can only be called wolfpack tactics . with just a little imagination , developers can turn this tech to many tasks that will force multiply manned boats and strengthen our navel forces , even in the event of downsizing from the [[CARDINAL]] boat [[ORG]] that seems to be needed for [[ORG]] projection of power , across the world .
is it nuclear powered ? capture of a drone like this could be quite an achievement for terrorists .
what happens when one of the student who was educated here reprograms it to return and explode .
what if syndrome is never ending , you do realize that , what if the sun does n't come up [[DATE]] ?
if the sun does n't come up [[DATE]] , i 'm sleeping in .
uhhh .... no .
i doubt a [[QUANTITY]] range was achieved with d cells unless range is specified in the direction of the current .
killer , autonomous drones . what could go wrong ?
awe .. just make a [[ORG]] and get it over with .
a torpedo by any other name is still a torpedo .
it 's a torpedo that carries other torpedo 's ... and soft pretzels too !
the [[GPE]] ca n't build stuff like this anymore without recruiting [[CARDINAL]] the engineers from foreign countries like [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] ( or the hard - studying children of [[GPE]] immigrants from such countries ) . too bad [[GPE]] 's schoolkids are spending all their time on social media and video games . maybe they 'll all grow up to be wealthy swindlers like their president . [[ORG]] tech is only going to delay the inevitable if we do n't fix education in this country . we might start by hiring an education secretary who actually knows something about education , rather than one who specializes in predatory lending and for - profit college scams .
what does the federal government have to do with education ? last i checked , states were in charge of education .
runwalk , the [[PERSON]] should not be involved in education . but they are . they give away a lot of our taxpayer cash ........ and the [[PERSON]] has a lot of strings attached .
so your saying throw more money at public education because we need better education , that has historically worked so well . the education secretary is perfect for the job , an outsider , all the insiders have made a huge mess of it and have plans to make it even messier . common core ring any bells ?
the problem is our political culture : no one was ever elected by saying folks , we 're going to have to work smarter and harder . we are going to you are a victim , capitalism is n't working , vote for me and i 'll get you what you are rightfully entitled to .
way to turn a technology report into a [[ORG]] rant . i had no idea [[ORG]] was that all - consuming .
we do n't get to many well written [[ORG]] skillfully done do n't you think .
how much money does the military need ?
to keep up with [[GPE]] ? more , much more ....
keep up with [[GPE]] ? how about sending every [[NORP]] student home , immediately we are teaching them how to compete with the [[GPE]]
at [[ORDINAL]] look you 'd think it was [[PERSON]] . i wish the [[ORG]] would n't release info about our developing weaponry , there is no need for our enemies to know what 's in our arsenal . remember , no one knew of the ' stealth ' bomber until we actually used it .
[[ORG]]
wars of the future will be fought more with robots than soldiers .
we get to be blown up without a fight . sad .
and then the robots take over .
think some are serving in [[ORG]] .
robots would be better than most serving in [[ORG]] .
uhhh what happens when the drone gets the idea that we are the bad guys ..... run run like the wind .
proof we really are a nation of [[ORG]] !
stick to your electric scooter screwball .
i ca n't wait for these babies to start sinking [[NORP]] ships ...
oh their ski boats can be sunk with a hunting rifle .
guaranteed , [[GPE]] has already stolen the plans and probably engineered a fault in the electronics that they can track the orca with .
baloney . [[CARDINAL]] itar parts on the drone are sourced from [[GPE]] .
did i say sourced from [[GPE]] ? no , a mole my friend , i am sure there are many , many moles . you ?
no . a trade compliance expert . no itar sourced to [[GPE]] . no [[NORP]] foreign nationals . [[NORP]] citizens only . period .
then we would n't have to wait [[DATE]] for [[PRODUCT]] to reach [[GPE]] -- one of these could just sit there [[CARDINAL]] .
so it is a rush to see who can build the most drones - since human life will eventually not be a factor in battle it will just be sheer number of land / air / sea drones .
hate it when a drone goes whoops .
there are already [[CARDINAL]] ways to croak , may as well add [[CARDINAL]] more .
pretty cool , except [[ORG]] of [[DATE]] : " the [[QUANTITY]] [[ORG]] , which would not fit in a submarine launch tube " . well , duh .
transport and launch it from the ships now used for transporting and launching landing craft , such as the ' lhd ' type .
just build a bigger sub ..... lol lollll
[[PERSON]] tournament going high tech .
cool , more death dealing drones .
good . now build [[CARDINAL]] of them before [[GPE]] does . why ? because it is certain [[GPE]] has already stolen the plans and specs .
for certain
my guess is that if we 're saying that constructions is starting they 've already been deployed for [[DATE]] . [[PERSON]] , used in several missions for [[DATE]] before we announced that we had them .
the military was crippled and rusting under [[PERSON]] . if [[NORP]] gain power , it will degrade again . there s your [[NORP]] collusion . and [[GPE]] loves [[NORP]] too .
the did send over a limo driver for a senator .
seems like they could have made the same thing at [[CARDINAL]] the weight , length , and price .... it is a drone after all ..
the should at least give [[ORG]] a ride in it .
it 's a diesel electric and needs to carry enough fuel and battery capacity for [[DATE]] of autonomous operation and 6500 nm range . that and the [[QUANTITY]] cargo capacity means it 's about as small as it can be . it 's only about the size of [[CARDINAL]] of those propane tanks you get your [[ORG]] tank refilled from .
i am sure we do n't know all it 's capabilities so you really can say if it could be done cheaper , though you are probably right .
and the inner - planet bomb teleportation devices
capt . small lol what a name .
to be sure , the story is only telling partial capabilities . enough to wet the appetite , yet far less than reality .
[[MONEY]] deal to build [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] that wo n't run over budget . right ?
that 's a nuclear sub killer
looks like something found in [[PERSON]] 's sock drawer .
finally some strategic planner thinking outside the box ! [[ORG]] would lose on the surface but win in the depths .
nuclear propulsion ? park it dormant , activate if needed ? give the [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] something to worry about .
agent over here will just open their suit cases and activate their devices . we there goes [[GPE]] .... wait not a bad idea .
reminds me of the last scene in the movie dr. [[PERSON]] .
yep ... i think this is the new creature of the deep
[[ORG]] won the contract ? god help us all
good we need the best , the fastest , the most powerful weapons to make sure this country is safe . peace through strength .
[[QUANTITY]] . one would think smaller would be better in this case . you could probably build [[CARDINAL]] smaller ones for the same price and they would be faster and be much harder to detect .
payload and range are driving forces for the size .
i think the weapons payload potential would probably be the reason for the size . i looked at a video of a torpedo . that 's a big honking weapon . they might could even cram [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] type missiles in there , or [[PERSON]] missiles and a few torpedos .
but then they would be limited to small ordnance ?
just like [[ORG]] that hates the a [[DATE]] from day one . the are still trying to replace it and have found just updating it works . i can tell you i talked with [[ORG]] folks who swear by the a 10 and the amount of damage just one of them can do . i ever see [[CARDINAL]] going to hit me there would be a new route to [[GPE]] fast .
i thought the same thing . you really do n't need a huge torpedo to down a ship or sub . personally i would still rather have multiple . i used to detect subs while in the military and the larger they where the easier they where to find .
lol ... all the comments below about releasing secrets ... maybe y' all are too young to remember sdi .. aka star wars defense initiative . the non - existent defense weapon almost single handedly bankrupted the [[GPE]] .
already in use . the really good weapon developements you will never hear about . in reality , we own [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . psssst … .. don't tell anyone .
now we 're talking . hopefully they have a [[ORG]] album on standby in that sub
the standard of killing goes up faster than the standard of living .
the standard for deterrent ....
down in the southern states they have a saying concerning justifiable homicide , " your honor , he needed killin " . sadly , they 're right . its just irony that we are better at killing than we are at loving .
when we remove the human element from our weapons systems , i think the urge to make war will increase dramatically . these high - tech goodies probably wo n't make us more safe .
nuclear bombs are human - less weapons . you have to think deterrence .
during my naval career i did a tod with [[ORG]] at [[FAC]] . we tested new and prospective weapon systems for naval combatants . way cool stuff we were doing in the early - mid [[DATE]] ’s including conversion of a decommissioned destroyer and making it fully remote control including firing of ship self defense systems against real anti ship missiles . what we were doing then was the ground work for what is routine [[DATE]] .
back in my time they were working on a row boat with a [[CARDINAL]] lbs bomb . seemed to be a good idea .
lol and you volunteered for that one ?
yeah , and i 'd like to know what you ca n't talk about !
pretty much everything that we were doing then is mainstream and even obsolete methods now . but there were a few times i wondered how we got our hands on one of those and i will leave it at that : ;)
militarily this " sounds " good , but it is a very , very bad idea for humanity !
no much in the military is good for humanity . if humanity ever grows up maybe it wo n’t be needed .
eisenhower agreed with you .
i like [[PERSON]] !
for the enemy .... fixed it for you .
i am sure you will agree even more once somebody hacks into it and takes control .
you 've been watching too much tv .
i generally do n't watch tv , but i do know professional hackers . i am betting for you it is the reverse .
no , i have friends who are professional hackers .
" the [[QUANTITY]] [[ORG]] , which would not fit in a submarine launch tube ... " i think it goes without saying [[PERSON]] , that if this platform is to fire torpedoes of its own it wo n't fit in a torpedo tube itself . more brilliance from the staff at [[ORG]] .
there are [[CARDINAL]] size torpedoes .
not to knock your intelligence , the story comes from warrior maven ... oops i guess i exposed your lack of brilliance rofl
several of these operating in conjunction with a strike group and attack subs . [[ORG]] ! increase [[ORG]] is huge
[[ORG]] - do n't fret about our " secrets " . the military would n't tell " reporters " any more than they 'd tell the enemy .
[[GPE]] will show off their version of this system in [[DATE]] ... strangely it will look just like ours . trump is right to hold their feet to the fire .
we are probably going to need that soon to blow [[GPE]] 's navy out of the water .
what happened to , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] ? "
ever hear of chewing gum and walking at the same time ?
for him , no . [[ORG]] all else . [[PERSON]] intended .
comments , [[GPE]] ?
no need to put men and women at risk underwater if you do n't have to .
if the [[GPE]] is good at anything its video games . hand everyone in the [[GPE]] a video controller , monitor and release [[CARDINAL]] of drones . they 'll never know what hit em / or make it an iphone /droid app !
[[PERSON]] has some big plans for the prototype floor model ..
[[ORG]] ? someone please tell me why they feel the need to let other countries know what our military is developing in terms of weapons .
what you hear in the news is either a red herring or just the tip of a much more secret program .
well , they have n't let them know that we have flying saucers that make hypersonic craft look slow . if push comes to shove we can control the earth .
seen the new one called [[LOC]] ship . looks like a [[NORP]] floats like a cloud , carrys several p bombs . hard to detect on [[DATE]] .
to keep them skert ?
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] is an underwater drone weapon , armed with a [[CARDINAL]] - megaton nuclear or conventional payload that can be detonated “ [[QUANTITY]] ” below the surface . this is meant to generate a radioactive tsunami capable of destroying coastal cities and other infrastructure several kilometers inland . " guess it is gon na be mutual
would n't that be a neutron bomb ?
no . [[PERSON]] bombs are designed as " people bombs " , lots of radiation but otherwise low - yield . for the [[NORP]] device , it would be high - yield bomb that would generate lots of fallout and explosive power
[[PERSON]] has been exaggerating his military capabilities of late . i think he learned it from the [[NORP]] .
[[PERSON]] is [[ORG]] and always will be and misdirection and disinformation is their stock and trade . as for the [[NORP]] , look up the history of [[GPE]] . in the persian language , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " means " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " and the [[NORP]] are known for being great barterers and dealmakers and it is not " of late " for [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] successfully bluffed the [[GPE]] in [[DATE]] that they had a big stock of icbm 's when they only had [[CARDINAL]] ( [[CARDINAL]] ) . they depended on [[ORG]] 's like what they tried to place in [[GPE]] for their offensive capability
i do n't believe the [[NORP]] have that , and i believe if an article like this is coming out now , then the [[GPE]] already has it or something like it already deployed out there .
as fighter pilots say , " honor the threat " . of note , in the article , [[ORG]] is taking off - the - shelf hardware and converting it to military use . the [[NORP]] have to [[ORDINAL]] steal it then make it from the ground up . and do n't forget , the [[NORP]] have already test - fired their hyper - sonic cruise missile , but they do have problems with production of virtually all weapons system
they can outsource it to us and we can build it for them .... they can trust us .
no need , they already steal everything to do it themselves
i would paint it just like an orca . probably have them perform at [[ORG]] .
until it launches a torpedo at the crowd .
we 've been r&d these for [[DATE]] with many variations . if we do not get a handle on cyber security , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] with have them also .
[[GPE]] and [[GPE]] already have them , and not because they stole designs from us . they have been working on these systems for [[DATE]] . while they both have manufacturing weaknesses , their engineers are top notch . and the [[NORP]] have a lot more engineers than the [[GPE]] does so it is only a matter of time before the manufacturing gap is closed as well .
[[CARDINAL]] g will fix that . it will end spying as they will have a direct link to the source .
yes , lets tell everyone ........ makes you wonder what they are really working on .
true . [[ORG]] diversion .
and the hackers are already to hack into one and start ww3
that explains the system i hacked in to [[TIME]] .
imagine watching so much tv and [[GPE]] you actually believe global catastrophy could be as simple as a ' drone hack ' away . i know decades of conditioning from the old boob - tube has made this and [[CARDINAL]] scenarios like it seem possible in your head , but with all assurance , its not . [[ORG]] has never and will never be an actual doctrine . it exists solely for conversational purposes and to make the population ' scared ' and controllable .
pretty sure the [[ORG]] will load mcafee on it .
i sure hope not , it would have a systems crash [[TIME]] .
hope the do n't have [[ORG]] updates on it , or we are in big trouble . i have not had [[TIME]] start up that does not take 15 mins to boot the system .
go [[ORG]] ! ! now all they need to do is develop smaller , shorter range torpedoes that these things can launch .
paint pelosi 's or [[ORG]] 's face on it so when it surfaces it will scare the heck out of the enemy .
and the fish .
maxine waters face would be more effective .
i could use one of these for dealing with [[ORG]] .
it 's long , it 's black , and it 's coming for you !
[[DATE]] . hopefully not a dollar short .
why release any information on this ? now the [[NORP]] know what to subvertly steal information on .
do you really think that the [[GPE]] releases military info before its obsolete to us ?
their land - based version is named [[PERSON]] .
just call or what it is .. it 's an unmanned torpedo ... no need to risk sailor lives when you can just deploy [[CARDINAL]] of these in the sea to do surveillance and if need be sail it into another vessel
put a guy in it and you 've reinvented the [[NORP]] human torpedo , or the [[NORP]] x - craft , or the [[NORP]] kaiten .
and modern subs are the css hunley , only bigger
new toy . let 's test it on [[GPE]] .
[[ORG]] builds planes in [[GPE]] so guess what .
oohh ... please general or admiral instruct us on all the military knowledge you want to bestow on us ...
[[QUANTITY]] , and will not fit in a launch tube . [[ORG]] must be fairly serious about using this for real if that 's all they 're even willing to say about it 's size .
they will just piggy back it like in [[EVENT]] .
what will piggy back ? this thing will launch from a dock and return to a dock on it 's own . [[CARDINAL]] crew . i doubt they will mate with any of our current subs because most are n't designed to do so , that 'd be far more dangerous than just having them operate on their own .
that thing gon na be surprised by a male killer whale from behind .
the [[ORG]] 's answer to quiet conventional subs .
massive ? i own a medium sized [[ORG]] that weighs [[QUANTITY]] ( i doubt if it would be seaworthy ) .
same type caterpillar bulldozer marks have been found on the bottom of some fjords in [[GPE]] .
i am pretty sure the [[ORG]] thought it through . thanks for your concern .
it 's all fun and games until it becomes self - aware and joins [[GPE]] .
yep ! we ca n’t even secure a debit card against a [[DATE]] ‘ hacker ’ in mama ’s basement , let alone an armed submarine drone with weapons at sea for [[DATE]] at a time , [[ORG]] .
do you think they will let me live in [[GPE]] ?
i will grow rabbits .
i got it , “ [[PERSON]] for red [[DATE]] ” movie . ? ?
be careful . [[CARDINAL]] actor with those aspirations ended up with severe lead and copper poisoning .
[[NORP]] navy is waiting for all the chinese students doing internship at [[ORG]] to return to [[GPE]] .
[[NORP]] would be happy if [[PERSON]] launched a [[PERSON]] or two at the usa- just so they could blame [[ORG]] . insane people .
they would have sided with [[PERSON]] if he had said something negative about [[ORG]] , pretty sad .
[[GPE]] will smite it with thier mighty smiter ! and that weird la - la - la - la war cry that the women do in the fallout shelters . they 're not concerned about the navy releasing this information or the secret weapons they may already have available .
