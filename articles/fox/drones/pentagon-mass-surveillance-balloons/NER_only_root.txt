another repeat by the deep state who spies on [[NORP]] for our own good supposedly . this is just a repeat of the [[ORG]] only in 3 dimensions so when the civil war begins the deep staters in the [[ORG]] will be able to see [[CARDINAL]] of armed bikers approaching [[GPE]] [[GPE]] to citizen arrest all the deep state criminals .
[[CARDINAL]] mass shootings [[DATE]] and yet it ca n’t seem to be stopped with all the current surveillance going on . seems like all this is just more big brother in our lives to infringe on our rights while providing [[CARDINAL]] security that actually protects us .
this article has [[CARDINAL]] comments . multiple articles discussing [[PERSON]] pointing out djt donors have 1000 's of comments each . i guess exposing the fact that djt is approving mass surveillance of [[NORP]] is n't as attention grabbing as manufactured outrage over someone posting publicly available information .
why not tether the same type of balloons over any [[GPE]] willing to fund and manage it themselves ! local police departments could direct drones after tracking to bldg 's . drones could tag any individual that exits the vehicle with paint or other means , that would be detectable by officers who would be arriving"undercover " at the same location , at the same time ! of course [[ORG]] will be against it .
good ole aclu ! they must stick their nose in anything considered against their liberal views .
big brother is watching you ! !
a test of technology within the borders of [[GPE]] where the balloons will not be attacked by some other nation 's [[ORG]] and where the terrain is already thoroughly known and understood gens - up so much vitriol from the leftists who are being manipulated by those who are seeking to cut their throats .
[[PERSON]] temperatures and balloons do n't mix well .
if they are going to spy on us at mass , they should also spy on other worship services .
[[ORG]] has lost all credibility . i ’ll play the percentages ; if they ’re against it , i ’m for it .
together with the [[NORP]] and the police
" ' we do not think that [[NORP]] cities should be subject to wide - area surveillance in which every vehicle could be tracked wherever they go , ' [[PERSON]] , a senior policy analyst at [[ORG]] , told the [[NORP]] newspaper . " someone should explain to mr. [[PERSON]] that when you leave your front door , the government has every right to track your location . whether they do it by a high - altitude balloon or a plain - clothes cop makes no difference .
if you want to deter border crossing and drug smuggling simply follow the [[ORG]] 's process for sub detection in [[EVENT]] . [[ORG]] [[PRODUCT]] balloons along the border and off shore and equip them with the same surveillance systems in these high altitude balloons .
the balloons and equipment were all made / developed in [[GPE]] and until now , mostly used in n.korea .
as if we are not under surveillance already !
wow , this is n't creepy and dystopian at all ; no sir !
the dogs lean out of the balloon , sniff the air , and can pinpoint a drug truck to within [[QUANTITY]] .
what if they are trying out a new way to track bad guys in the country . a [[QUANTITY]] radius is more than you can drive in [[TIME]] , plus it is a moving radius being tivo'd , so in [[TIME]] they have [[PERSON]] very much . i do n't like it but it is going to happen regardless of my like or dislike .......... yes the government is way out of control of the common citizen ................. big brother is watching us all ................
are we in [[DATE]] [[GPE]] yet ?
paranoid much ? it 's just data capture and not identification and definitely not used for anything in the [[GPE]] for law enforcement or monitoring purposes as that 's illegal and the government can not use it to prosecute any cases . the military is testing it for a persistent surveillance system to protect bases in enemy territories abroad . this long term , high altitude platform is less susceptible to being shot down , tampered with or affected by low level weather patterns and it provides a greater safety footprint for troops as it sees farther than current systems . get a life people .
do n't have a problem with it since i 'm a law abiding citizen . cameras catch bad guys [[DATE]] ..... cameras save cops from being unfairly charged ............. and this is for the protection of the country not to see if [[PERSON]] is slipping into his neighbors bedroom when her husband is away .
anyone who thinks we are n't already being tracked by government is buzzzz ! ! ! ! zap ! ouch ! that hurts ! ! ! stop ! ! ! [[PERSON]] , enough already ! ! ! ... sorry about that . now , where were we ? oh yes , as i was saying , wait ... who were you again ? then again , who am i ? great googly - moogly . i want my mommy ! ! !
seems to me that this is no different than people flying drones over your house or the government recording every phone call made . sure it would a very useful tool in many instances such as tracking criminals or locating missing people , but just like everything else the government runs , it will be miss used and our rights will be trampled .
this technology + armed drones + robot cops + solar power + [[WORK_OF_ART]] . [[DATE]] is coming !
yeah , o k. you and your vehicle , are tracked nearly all the time right now . cell phones , security cameras , [[ORG]] cameras , license plate scanners , credit / debit cards , food stamp cards welfare cards , [[ORG]] cards . you get my drift . any sense of privacy went out the window long ago . now , complaining about it being tested does n't help . it leaves a lot of questions unanswered as usual . and maybe that was the intent of the author . orr the government !
of course your government will never use these balloons for any other type of " surveillance . " trust them .
i 'm not suggesting anyone fire their guns up into the air at objects which may be spying on them , but ... lol , who am i kidding ? fire at will . no , not at [[ORG]] . at the drone that 's spying on your wife in the bathtub .
well google would do it if they could , and that would make it alright to the liberals . for the record all the technology exists to do this in real time using little more than your cell phone as a tracking device . it knows where you are at all times . who is near you at any time . who you call , how long you talk , who you text , the contents of those texts ( in the clear as well as encrypted ) . all with the smallest amount of access to your phone .
i do not like this , it upsets me .
it is most likely that the purpose of the balloons is secretive and this article is part of a disinformation objective . with the exception of mostly old klunkers , the movements of individual cars can be tracked via the cel phone network and their electronic feature systems , i.e. [[ORG]] , [[GPE]] , etc . individuals can be tracked the same way through their cel phones . the cel phone is the perfect surveillance device . it 's absolute genius ! the subject buys the device , pays for the service , keeps the device charged , and takes it with them everywhere they go .
at [[CARDINAL]] it can only see a [[QUANTITY]] radius circle at most
what ? facial recognition , warrentless monitoring of our voice and internet traffic and automated license plate readers are n't enough ?
why are n't they testing this where it may actually be useful : [[GPE]] , the southern border , [[GPE]] ? nothing so exciting as watching [[PERSON]] baling hay in [[GPE]] . what a waste .
ca n't let this technology get into the hands of a socialistic [[NORP]] president and government , it would be another step into the big brother control that the progressive left wants for the [[GPE]] . just think of what freedoms we could lose under [[ORG]] . under it 's premise , the government could restrict your ability to go about your business because they would control all travel . part of their plan is to eliminate the current modes of transport in this country or to make them totally new . well in all of those new vehicles they could put gps technology to know your every move , regulate your speed , and actually divert your destination . same holds true of airline service , they could control the entire schedule and make it difficult for the average person to travel anywhere , if we even have it for the common folk any longer they might force you to take a train . the green new deal is not about climate change but about control and progressive leftist are trying to control you , not save the planet . most of the know they ca n't control the weather or climate , but they can control you if you let them .
sounds like a real gas ...
what , does this mean i ca n't take a leak of my back deck any more ? ? ? ?
it 's wonderful , the government looks out for our well being . they are kind of like a big brother to us . it makes me feel so safe .
i seem to remember an ancient law against the military doing law enforcement in the [[GPE]] .
the right to privacy is the right to self . you " own " you . you decide when you want to share you and when you do n't . it is really just that simple .
too bad if you do n't like it . you voted for [[ORG]] so this is what you get .
the government should not be able to snoop on your property if it ca n't be seen from public property by means available when the [[LAW]] was written !
i do not like this , the gov has grown out of control . clear violation of the [[ORDINAL]]
left now " oooh such a daaaangerous idea ! intruding into people 's privacy ! " left in power " we need this to keep people protected . "
“ we should not go down the road of allowing this to be used in [[GPE]] and it ’s disturbing to hear that these tests are being carried out , by the military no less . ” exactly
gets out of backyard pool , looks up , quickly puts clothes back on and goes inside .
did not [[LOC]] fight against something similar to this in the movie , but they were flying aircraft carriers . [[CARDINAL]] step leads to next . freaking govt types , all they think of is big brother schemes ....
this will be crucial law enforcement tool before long . this stuff was tried out in [[GPE]] and recorded a drug cartel killing and followed the criminals till they were caught . this and hi res video surveillance from above will catch on real quick .
big brother . we are paying now for not listening to [[PERSON]] back then .
maybe they can find out who was breaking into [[GPE]] house .
