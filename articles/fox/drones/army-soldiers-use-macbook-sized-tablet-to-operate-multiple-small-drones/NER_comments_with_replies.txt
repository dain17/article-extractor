hmmm , pizza delivery to the front lines , boys !
the picture they use makes it look like they 're using the drone to deliver some pizzas .
you do n't know about military pizza ? it 's all part of the plan for world domination .
military pizza is partly how i got my mid - section to be in the fantastic shape it 's in !
anyone else think they photoshopped that stack of blocks onto the rope in the photo ? and if so , why in the world did they do that ? ?
was the very first thing i noticed . ca n't believe that pic made it past editorial review .
those are pizzas being flown to forward areas .
[[ORG]] already has a [[ORG]]
had to be . that drone would never fly that tail heavy .
maybe styrofoam .
big words for a [[ORG]] article .
very cool .
did n't they see [[WORK_OF_ART]] ?
here we go with all of the " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " references . i am all for any technology that puts our warriors further away from harm or better equipped to deal with the danger .
all [[CARDINAL]] of my pizzas that thing is carrying better be here in under [[TIME]]
and if this fails , [[ORG]] will have a new crazy fast delivery system
and even dropping it from [[QUANTITY]] onto its top in your driveway will result in less of your pizza stuck to the lid of the box than when ol' andrew delivers it .
