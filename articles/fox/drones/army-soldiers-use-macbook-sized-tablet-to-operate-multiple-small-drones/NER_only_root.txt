hmmm , pizza delivery to the front lines , boys !
the picture they use makes it look like they 're using the drone to deliver some pizzas .
anyone else think they photoshopped that stack of blocks onto the rope in the photo ? and if so , why in the world did they do that ? ?
big words for a [[ORG]] article .
very cool .
did n't they see [[WORK_OF_ART]] ?
here we go with all of the " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " references . i am all for any technology that puts our warriors further away from harm or better equipped to deal with the danger .
all [[CARDINAL]] of my pizzas that thing is carrying better be here in under [[TIME]]
and if this fails , [[ORG]] will have a new crazy fast delivery system
