wow hope they can use this method to burn the [[GPE]] covid
uh oh ... the pyromaniacs on [[LOC]] have a newfangled way to start forest fires ... thanks , [[GPE]] for your contribution ...
[[ORG]]
i had someone on social media say , " imagine if 1000 's of these were let loose in [[GPE]] cities to create havoc and burn them to the ground how could we ever fight against it ? " my response was simple ... shotguns . if i can hit a clay pigeon i can hit these contraptions no problem . lol .
this is on my [[DATE]] list .
perfect for cleaning out antifa nests .
i know what i 'm asking [[PERSON]] for !
this would be awesome ! fun for the whole family ! just hope it does n't come from wish ...
then some po'd wasp calls in a murder hornet hit .
that must be what they want to practice with when they are practicing in [[GPE]] . because they have no mountains or cold temperatures according to [[PERSON]] . yeah right . where do they think snow leopards are found . in cold mountainous regions of which [[GPE]] has several .
perhaps we could use something like that for the murder hornet problem on [[LOC]] ?
murder by drones coming soon to a theater near you
the [[ORDINAL]] trumpet , the [[ORDINAL]] woe ! ( [[DATE]] ) . [[CARDINAL]] the horses and riders i saw in my vision looked like this : their breastplates were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow as sulphur . the heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke and sulphur . [[CARDINAL]] a [[ORDINAL]] of mankind was killed by the [[CARDINAL]] plagues of fire , smoke and sulphur that came out of their mouths . you know its comin ' .
wasp lives matter . you 've destroyed their home way up in a tree . they were n't hurting anyone . they were just pollinating flowers .
next a ship they do nt like goes through the [[LOC]] sea down swoop flaming drones
so , [[GPE]] is [[GPE]] 's greatest adversary , yet [[ORG]] has just one homepage story about [[GPE]] and it 's a drone wasp killer story . nice .
how utterly despicable .
we need these to incinerate trumpers !
awesome use of technology . do they also have a firefighter drone ?
" it hovers above a hive as large as a suitcase before swooping down . " - america , you [[ORG]] need to learn the metric system .
how is this a surprise ? does anyone actually believe white anglo saxon protestants are welcome in [[GPE]] ?
this seems very handy for , starting massive forest fires on [[LOC]] .
[[ORG]] !
test it on [[ORG]] before harming wasps .
usa should test these out on [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] wasps .
just imagine this drone carnage coming to a business district in your town . [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] will be out of a job .
‰∏∫‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫ÁöÑÂàõÈÄ†ÂäõËÄåËµûÂèπÔºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÁâõÈÄº ÔºÅ ÔºÅ ÔºÅ
[[ORG]] is just test driving this for when they disperse future demonstrations .
need a couple of these for antifa demonstrations .
hey [[PERSON]] ! - you get fire !
where can i buy 1 because i have a few things i would like to burn down ?
[[ORG]] ! [[GPE]] flamethrower kills coronavirus virus before killing [[CARDINAL]] across the world ..........
when the burned wasps fall to the ground , the villagers scurry to pick up the crispy morsels ... covid-20 coming to your door for [[DATE]] .
that [[GPE]] is full of surprises ! they showed the world [[DATE]] . let ‚Äôs see how countries allow their scum
2020 has crushed my soul and i have lost hope that there would be any good news , and then i see this ! [[ORG]] take note and start fulfilling orders .
sounds like fun .
doe amazon carry these ?
we do n't need to worry about [[NORP]] / socialist / libs getting their hands on one , they do n't work , so do n't have money to buy one . oh wait , they 'll just burn and loot the store that sells them . silly me .
would work well on looters too .
got to admit , that ‚Äôs pretty cool .
that story give the terrorist idea how to start multi fire in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .
about burned our house down [[DATE]] doing about the same thing , a pole with a burning rag . real happy we had a long hose that was hooked up and ready to work !
[[DATE]] a wasps nest . tomorrow , a small village . have to remember that the [[NORP]] do n't do anything unless it benefits the party , and the state .
oh dear ! why is the terminator the 1st thing i thought of ?
the [[ORG]] will be suing blue sky on behalf of the discriminated victims .
next thing you know , [[NORP]] [[NORP]] that are here for " work or an education " will be flying drones around unleashing viruses
can it be used against [[PERSON]] ?
this thing looks very useful and fun ( ? ) . i want one .
[[GPE]] must have a lot of wasp problems . it might had been cheaper if they had just a long pole with a flame thrower attached to it .
i took out mine with a can of wd-40 and a long stem lighter
this is [[GPE]] . how long before those flame - throwing drones turn on the people ?
some wasp will survive and make it their queen . then colonies of flame throwing wasp will spread through out the world .
if we 're not careful , [[GPE]] will be burning wasps instead of wasps .
lives of insects of the order hymenoptera matter .
they are testing on wasps .... next will be [[GPE]] households ...
[[ORG]]
coming to a battlefield near you .
a spray of pesticide would have worked just as well but would have been less exciting i suppose .
i got ta have one of these ! [[ORG]] - sauce ! !
the [[ORG]] 's [[ORG]] nightmare . available for $ [[MONEY]] from [[GPE]] .
this was [[PERSON]] fault
[[CARDINAL]] more thing to worry about if you 're a citizen of [[GPE]] and do n't tow the communist line . better look up first before you say anything about the [[ORG]] !
explosives , hydraulics , and flamethrowers ... it is a guy thing .
[[PERSON]] .... godzilla ... üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è üèÉ üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è üèÉ üèÉ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è
use this on [[PERSON]] ‚Äôs wig !
[[PERSON]] [[NORP]] spy girlfriend has one of these flamethrower drones to use on [[PERSON]] 's wife . things wo n't end well for that dude .
[[PERSON]] said he was happy to see his fellow country men testing his new [[ORG]] antipersonnel drones . and said he was excited to be using them soon .
we could never have that here . the tree - huggers would loose their minds .
send this thing up to [[GPE]] . they need some flame throwing .
this scenario , shows a disgusting lack of human compassion . but , did n't we already know that about this society of people ? the creators of radical , gender eugenics . euthanizing infant and baby girls for [[DATE]] !
my dream job .
looks like that thing could be useful in other ways . [[ORG]] mostly peaceful protests hunting coward prosecutors and mayors . [[PERSON]]
where are the wasp lives matter protest ?
too many carbon emissions , got ta ban it
big whoop . [[GPE]] can do that from [[QUANTITY]] out in space and has .
bring down the price a little and i 'll finally have something to make the neighbors dog stop barking .
i saw something similar in the movie [[WORK_OF_ART]] . i wonder what other uses a drone like this could have .
how about burning down all the wet markets in [[GPE]] . call them the burnt black markets .
[[GPE]] here i come !
can they fly this over the [[GPE]] " autonomous ' zone ?
what i like to do is what i assume most normal people would do , i ‚Äôm just gon na call the bee exterminator , have him come down and take a look at things , he ‚Äôll probably charge me [[MONEY]] to take care of the problem . plus if the problem persists he ‚Äôs going to come back at no charge till it ‚Äôs gone pretty much . all the while i ‚Äôm sitting inside hanging out with the family just waiting for the process to be over . what happens if the flame throwing drone decides to explode while you ‚Äôre getting it ready to go into the air ‚Ä¶ wait [[TIME]] , you ‚Äôre probably dead or close to it . pretty cool but definitely saving something like this for the guy that chooses risk over common sense .
can we borrow that and use it in [[GPE]] ?
i can see them putting that thing to other uses
thank you wondrous leader , wasps are gone ..... now rebuild village
it works the same with the [[GPE]] virus , except on cities .
please take care of [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] soon . will really appreciate .
[[ORDINAL]] wasps ...... then [[NORP]] uighurus
[[PERSON]] technology from [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] army . [[GPE]] used it in bringing democracy around the world . [[GPE]] in same way . instead of [[ORG]] , burning woman and children . long live democracy based on fake wmd and other lies
should be on the shelves at your local big box on [[DATE]] in time for [[DATE]] .
never nknew wasps to build up in a tree like that ? sure it was n‚Äôt a [[NORP]] nest ?
good idea , until someone sets a forest fire .
dem roaster .... i 'll take [[CARDINAL]] .
i hope this drone becomes self - aware .
bright idea until the tree also caught fire and burned to the ground .
[[GPE]] , please ... ! ! !
[[PERSON]] heck we got lasers , just point and click
wonder if those things spread covid through the air too ?
that can be bad in the hands of [[PERSON]] bro ‚Äôs or blm .
ÁÉßÊéâÈÇ£‰∫õË∞ãÊùÄÈªÑËúÇ [[GPE]]
as [[PERSON]] once sang : " c'm on baby light my fire , it 's time to set the night on fire . . . "
i ca n't believe they paid $ [[MONEY]] for that drone . it looks like an [[CARDINAL]] mm home built that 's should cost [[MONEY]] depending on the motors , [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] , or not . that looks fun and awesome .
there 's more to this story ..... they are n't afraid of being stung , wasps eat insects and that 's competition for the townspeople .... they 'll eat anything
maybe i wo n‚Äôt have to wait to pee on [[GPE]] ‚Äôs grave , drone would do quite nicely .
they should torch [[ORG]] and batwoman
this could eliminate cops getting killed in riots . crowd control with tear gas or rubber billets .
" [[GPE]] flamethrower drone burns wasp nests " -------------------- cool . the absolute perfect solution for dealing with that ' red [[ORG]] ' occupation in [[GPE]] .
just a matter of time before they start using it on dissidents .
if you have a wasp nest , do this during [[DATE]] . use a wet vac with [[QUANTITY]] of water and a few tablespoons of dawn dishwashing liquid . attach the flexible tube to a 2x4 of whatever length you need to put the opening of the tube next to the nest . turn it on . walk away and let it do its work . the noise will attract the wasps and then suck them up . the dawn will cause their [[GPE]] to disintegrate . leave the vacuum on for [[TIME]] . give it a short cool down break . turn it on again . leave for [[TIME]] . [[DATE]] repeat . you do need to do this during the day when they are active and out and about . on [[DATE]] , at [[TIME]] , soak the nest with wasp spray to get any remaining wasps . use your wet vac to suck it up . i have never gotten stung . just have patience . you can watch videos on you tube with this . it works . this fire thing is crazy . you 'll burn down the forest .
they have to burn the nests at [[TIME]] when all of the wasps are in it .
i want one , but there 's always a but ; it is against the law in the [[GPE]] to have a weaponized drone folks . but it would be cool , think of the possibilities . i saw one on utube with a gun . a bomber would be pretty easy to make i imagine . could make a tree trimmer out of [[CARDINAL]] .
[[DATE]] wildfire season is gon na be lit ......
ca n't wait until the peaceful protestors get their hands on these . liberals will say they wanted their bread toasted .
wait until they start using it on people . that is what you will get under a compromised [[PERSON]] . congrats america
this has me thinking of a new game . maybe these things could be set up to shoot paintballs . hunters with special non - destroying shotguns , maybe with low - powered lasers , could try to shoot them out of the sky before getting splattered with a paint ball . i know a few guys who would really get into something like that .
[[PERSON]] was hiding right in the middle of the nest protected by [[NORP]] wasps ! ! !
would lover to have one . got a couple of [[NORP]] nests i 'd like rid on on my property , and would like done to run off possums . i 'd not light them up , but definitely run them off .
in the [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] would be screaming bloody murder - wasp . probably get a court injunction , and get the murder - wasp murderers jailed .
oooooh , i want one ! but not for wasps ...
that 's awesome ! i love the [[NORP]] !
there 's a big hive of swamp creatures blocking the swamp drain ....
here it would take [[DATE]] to get the environmental assessment and permits [[ORDINAL]] .
does it work on antifa nests ?
coming soon to a protest march in [[GPE]] .........
i guess the wind that day was below [[QUANTITY]] .
could have used one in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . lol
that could come in handy to break up rioters too !
look at what [[GPE]] can do when [[NORP]] keep buying from [[ORG]] .
wasps are very important pollinators ...... wasps are so - so dancers ..... do nt confuse the [[CARDINAL]] ....
why can i not buy one of these on [[ORG]] ? me likey ...
elon , are you listening ?
do that have those on ebay yet ?
i must say , that 's pretty cool . would never happen in the states . too many regulations on drones .
anyone in [[GPE]] taking notes ?
there is a place in [[GPE]] outsde a red house where this device would be useful .
they are perfecting them and will use them on non - compliant citizens in [[GPE]]
works on dissidents , also .....
terminator !
can they make a mosquito version ?
if you can get to the nest wd-40 works great . it coats their wings and ca n't fly then crush them under your foot . i like the excitement and the challenge ! though this method of using a drone is better it is far more expensive and lacks courage or maybe stupidly on my part . do n't know witch .
yawn ... this making the news ?
wasp nest , homes , people , [[NORP]] , new weapon for [[GPE]] for ethnic cleansing
[[PERSON]] !
the [[NORP]] probaby tested it on a hive of [[NORP]] [[ORDINAL]] .
that is awesome frying the wasps with a drone is a very futuristic [[DATE]] way of doing things ! i ‚Äôm sure honey bees üêù will also be breathing a sigh of relief without these predators to deal with as well as nearby homeowners !
this could be adopted to disperse [[ORG]] !
[[CARDINAL]] of these needs to be sent to the ca capital to clean out all of the annoying wasps there ! particularly the one named [[GPE]] , and his family member [[PERSON]] !
not sure of the big issue . unless people are climbing up the trees , most of the wasps and hornets just do their thing and leave you alone . we have them in the woods here . it 's when they build on your porch or garden that you get problems .
great idea we may need that here with the murder hornets coming here .
now that is cool ! i wonder if it could be adapted to shoot out an electric spark instead , kind of like a mini lightning bolt ... just powerful enough to give a rioter or a fleeing criminal a good debilitating zap , but not enough to kill people .
[[PERSON]] invented flying flamethrowers ... and [[PERSON]] .....
we use reruns of the [[NORP]] here ........ wasps kill themselves in no time flat .....
this ai n‚Äôt no judeo [[NORP]] way of doing things .
a can of carb cleaner or hair spray also works well .
yeah , her mind is declining and [[PERSON]] is sharp as a tack . [[NORP]] love their old , senile white people .
now that they have it perfected , they 'll use it against [[ORG]] [[NORP]] during their invasion of the usofa.
use it in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
‚Äú your children are next if [[PERSON]] steals this election . ‚Äù actual quote from this comment section , probably .
pretty cool . what could possibly go wrong with that ?
no video , fake news !
‚Äú now we do n‚Äôt have to worry about being stung by a wasp . ‚Äù but if you do get stung , it will be by [[CARDINAL]] mighty pzzzed - off wasp .
so how many men just put this on their christmas wish list ? ?
the perfect solution to [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] [[GPE]] .
[[ORG]] ? ? ?
does n't that just seem like it should be a bad guy weapon in [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] ?
if you live in [[GPE]] , i 'm not sure getting stung by a wasp is your biggest problem .
if it 's a good location a [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] full choke works . also lots - o - fun without starting forest fire or having a drone with pressurized flammable liq tank falling on someone 's house .
great environmental damage .
they could n't just call [[PERSON]] ?
i now know exactly what i 'm asking [[GPE]] [[DATE]] for [[DATE]] !
we need that here for [[ORG]] riots ! !
wasps provide us with free , eco - friendly natural pest - control services . in a world without wasps , we would need to use more toxic pesticides to control the insects that eat our crops and carry diseases . [[ORG]] also pollinate .
this has potential for use in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
is this available on [[ORG]] ? what fun ! ! ! !
where is the news here , these sort of flame thrower drones were featured on an episode of [[FAC]] [[DATE]] .
illegal in [[GPE]] unfortunately . ca n't carry hazmat ( flame thrower ) on a drone , at least under [[ORG]] part [[CARDINAL]] rules . bummer .
a drone with a gasoline tank attached . what could possibly go wrong ? ü§£ üëç üëå
they must be capitalist wasps ......
this has to be the * hottest * gift for [[DATE]] .
say what you want about [[GPE]] but that 's pretty cool !
sponsored by [[PERSON]] ........
how much [[MONEY]] does [[ORG]] pay to [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] to carry / to print the news from [[NORP]] [[GPE]] ?
cool .
do not buy chicom stuff !
look out uighurs ! you ‚Äôre next ... and you wo n‚Äôt hear a peep from [[ORG]] or [[PERSON]] and the [[ORG]] ....
would love to see this tested on [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] .
or you can buy a can of [[PERSON]] for $ [[MONEY]] .
[[ORG]] knows how to make a virus that kills select people , fix elections and a flame throwing drone .
how does that drone perform against [[CARDINAL]] gauge buckshot ?
those poor defenseless wasps . they should have carefully caught each 1 and relocated them .
how are they on [[PERSON]] ?
works great on dissidents also .
anyone who actually believes this flame - throwing drone was ' invented ' by a ' volunteer rescue group ' is brain dead . [[ORG]] , developed , and built for the [[NORP]] military by [[ORG]] for use against any domestic group or foreign population seen as an anti - communist threat . do n't be surprised if a small group of [[GPE]] deep - staters are giddy to get a few of these drones for their own unconstitutional use . maybe the recent spate of [[GPE]] wild fires is n't a natural occurrence , after all these things do have to be tested .
[[GPE]] ! i mean [[NORP]] [[GPE]] is gunna git us ! tv man said so , and they ca n't lie !
good , an idea , turned into an invention that works ... well done
we can expect the crispy critters at the local [[NORP]] street market .
[[PERSON]] , corporate news loses its primary means to bully [[ORG]] and his supporters . perhaps now the will begin " reporting " completely useless trash like this story .
then , [[DATE]] , crops in this area will underperform . only then will they discover that these wasps were critical to pollinating their crops ... at which point [[ORG]] will seize the drone and send its builders to a slave labor camp where they will be forced to work [[TIME]] shifts building drones that are sold at [[ORG]] stores in the [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] could deliver it 's next bioweapon attack the same way and over a wide area in any neighborhood or business district ! watch for it !
[[ORG]] military propaganda .
oh no , now every [[NORP]] looter and marauder from ny to [[GPE]] is asking [[GPE]] for a drone flamethrower . these 'll go over real big on [[GPE]] weekends .
as a store owner can i use it against looters ?
should n't give any ideas to rats .
the [[NORP]] know to handle political dissent , this is just the newest version of that .
maybe this is being used in [[GPE]] !
i want [[CARDINAL]] . madam pelosi 's shack looks like a great big wasp nest ...
yet there is still the black folk shooting and killing each other in war - like proportions in our major cities . that could be news but it 's just too racist to be " news " .
next to come from [[GPE]] : fire proof wasps
i was hoping they meant places like the hamptons .
any word from peta ? thought so , not a peep !
it 's an omen , [[GPE]] will be destroyed by fire . üî•
pretty smart idea
thankfully , i do n't live in [[GPE]] .
i like the ingenuity , but wasps are good to have around . they clean up on mosquitoes and other small insects .
‚Äú now we do n‚Äôt have to worry about being stung by a wasp . ‚Äù now all we have to worry about is our communist government having armed drones .
the noninvasive [[ORG]] are our friends ! they are ferocious insect eaters in addition to cross pollination of plants . they seldom sting people . i have a nest on my property [[DATE]] for [[DATE]] .
looks like a helicopter to me
# [[PERSON]] [[ORG]] lives matter [[ORG]] , seems racist ... # [[PERSON]] could be confused with white lives matter
hmmmm , leaded or unleaded gasoline ? here , in the [[GPE]] , we were vanquished from using lead . from car paints to fuel . where 's the [[ORG]] now ? what 's the supreme word on releasing toxic , cancer causing chemicals into the environment ? asking for a friend .
they 're gon na love this in tinder dry [[GPE]] .
ideal weapon to use against [[ORG]] rioters and looters !
they wo n't be applauding when the govt ones start chasing them off the streets and into their homes . coming to the commie nation soon .
are these available on [[ORG]] ? asking for a friend .
we could make those for $ [[MONEY]] in the [[GPE]] , if we had n't moved production to other countries .
[[ORG]] here . [[GPE]] has a new war weapon , and production is disguised as insect pest control
[[ORG]] 's loss is the end of the toxic news era . perhaps now all corporate " news " will go softly into [[TIME]] . useless trash .
i want one .
another machine meant to do good will eventually be used to do evil .
the [[NORP]] must really hate wasps . :)
ok , [[ORG]] , you stand right there , and [[GPE]] , you stand right next to her , and [[PERSON]] , right next to [[GPE]] , and [[GPE]] , right behind all [[CARDINAL]] , and [[GPE]] , you stand right in front of them . ok , this drone is going to take your picture .... [[PERSON]] ?
[[ORG]] would have bought [[CARDINAL]] of these and burned the entire western [[GPE]] if the election fraud had n't worked .
we need to get some of these on order . these would be handy in the next round of " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
interesting that this operation reportedly is being conducted by a volunteer organisation and in cooperation with villagers - but is [[ORG]] linked to [[GPE]] 's military ? if not , it would appear that this sort of technology is available to the general public . hopefully the eradication involves nests of murder hornets so fewer and none will be able hitch rides to the [[GPE]] on products imported from [[GPE]] .
the drone ‚Äôs nickname : [[CARDINAL]] [[PERSON]]
[[ORG]] surplus flamethrower is better . and more fun . its good for hives , weeds , chop encampments , barricades around houses , houses in barricades , terrorists building barricades , deadbeat bipocs living in [[DATE]] home . [[CARDINAL]] 's of uses .
i can certainly think of other uses for this drone . can we buy it at best buy or [[ORG]] ?
have to admit , it 's very clever , but it looks like that thing is liable to burn a lot more than just the wasp 's nest .
hey , that 's it ! ! ! next election vote by drone , no spreading of germs .
battlebots ! ! !
this could be a game changer for crowd control for the riots .
[[GPE]] state run tv is the same as [[NORP]] state run tv . no difference . all [[CARDINAL]] sided news .
the same drone , or others like it , can deliver packages , papers , and illicit devices as well . we should remember that .
just in case you were wondering : these are not for sale in the state of [[GPE]] .
why ? the wasps were just living the dream .
a new vision for lighting cigars and fireworks .
ca gov. [[PERSON]] will use these for people who violate his outdoor dining ban . obay or burn !
" and if you order within [[TIME]] , we 'll throw in a free bamboo steamer ! ! "
we need [[ORG]] tech that can disable their everything .
hmmm . [[ORG]] is at top of tree . were they really a big enough problem that they had to be eradicated ? wasps are big pollinators . in [[DATE]] they will be complaining because it is such a bad year for crops that get pollinated by bees/ wasps .
if that truly cost them [[CARDINAL]] g 's to put together ? they are not that smart .
oh , i could have some fun with that !
an excellent and creative way to deal with this problem . do n‚Äôt automatically assume [[NORP]] people are bad . they are like us trying to improve themselves and live their lives . just as we are seeing with our own gov and institutions ... their gov is where evil lurks . [[GPE]] was a great [[PERSON]] in [[EVENT]] . they could be again .
just what i need for my neighbor 's cats !
can someone photoshop [[PERSON]] 's head on there ... ?
got ta give the [[NORP]] credit on this one . it 's a brilliant idea , but they should be careful about starting wildfires . using that technique in [[GPE]] would not be a good idea , but then again maybe it would .
news flash -- city of [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] destroyed by fire . details at [[CARDINAL]] .
that 's all good until the entire tree burns , catching other trees and houses on fire .
ok , [[ORG]] !
and what other weapons are they putting on their drones ... ? ?
i just bought 1000 honey bees to get my honey business going . when i counted them , it came out to [[DATE]] bees . the guy i bought them from said , yeah i gave you a freebie .
it is not that someone used a drone to kill a wasp nest , that worries me . it is that someone used a drone and equipped it to shoot liquid fire from a drone , that scares the hell out of me .
[[GPE]] does n't need flame throwers . they just let [[ORG]] turn on the electricity . problem solved .
all of the trees in [[GPE]] are on fire ! [[GPE]] issues a wildfire pandemic . [[GPE]] is a pro creating pandemics .
is it possible to build one of these to eradicate feminism ?
now they can be used with pepper spray , tear gas , etc . to combat riots since we have fewer police and the police do n't have to become targets of bottles and bricks .
i do n't know why they spend so much money to make one .... they have them in [[LOC]] catalogs for treefitty each ....
just in time for [[DATE]] ! ! ! !
and where were these things during the riots in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] ?
can we use it on election deniers ?
is it a available on [[ORG]] yet ? still need a present for the [[ORG]] paperboy .
to cover up their tracks . somehow honey pots got mistranslated .
after practise they can send 1000of these drones to swarm our [[ORG]] ships
no country on earth damages the environment with more gusto than [[GPE]] .
only bad things can come of this .
[[GPE]] quality drone starts forest fires ?
the perfect gift for the man who has everything , except a flame throwing drone . i hope [[GPE]] leaves one under the üéÑ for me .
you can buy a saw at the [[PERSON]] store .
[[NORP]] made flame throwing drones . what could possibly go wrong ?
they are just practicing for the actual future uses .
certain groups in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] want to know if this would work on police cars . ( sick )
need [[CARDINAL]] of these for the next gathering of [[ORG]] .
oh great .... i hope my nephews do n't see this ... they already have a couple of drones ....
now get rid of the [[NORP]] covid-19 you started .
now we know who 's been setting all the wildfires .
next report will be that a specific area of [[GPE]] is experiencing widespread forest fires . the global nabobs will blame these conflagrations on the [[GPE]] and global warming .
as a believer in [[PERSON]] , my advice to these absolute idiots , who would use their authority and armament to achieve this destruction : beware the [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , called god !
the [[PERSON]] brothers and [[PERSON]] would be so proud !
they also came up with one that shoots blasts of ice cold water onto [[ORG]] 's pants when he gets too close to one of their spies !
yes , now we know how the [[PERSON]] virus spread so quick . that drone was prodly used to spread the virus all over the place . yes , those bees were just used for target practice before they used it to make us all sick . those [[NORP]] are really out to destroy us too .
the [[NORP]] will be using it on us in [[DATE]] .
where can i get one ?
uh oh , wait until peta finds out !
thar gon na drone fire us to death ! ! hey , you just said ' [[GPE]] ' , are n't you supposed to say ' [[NORP]] [[GPE]] ' [[DATE]] ? the conditioning wo n't stick if you are n't consistent !
i want one . i do n't know what i am going to do with it , but i will figure that out later .
[[GPE]] is set to purchase [[CARDINAL]] .
they ‚Äôre having a fire sale .
[[GPE]] needs one of those per cubic foot of land
what is with the [[ORG]] news page , you have to guess what link to click to see the video ? ? ?
so what 's to stop multiple drones from lighting up [[ORG]] ?
what could possibly go wrong ? haha ! it will be no more than a week from now that we 'll see people having built these things here & posting youtube videos of them setting stuff on fire , probably their own homes & one another too . if i 'm being honest , it certainly got me thinking about those old drones i 've got packed away in my spare bedroom which i probably only used for [[TIME]] a piece before sticking them back there and forgetting about them because this does look like good fun ! the [[NORP]] here have already banned everyone from being allowed to have any fun doing anything so there 's lots of people looking for an outlet right now . i ca n't say that i 'm sure why they feel the need to bother these wasps who are minding their own business high up in those trees , is getting stung by these things really that big of a problem ? seems like they 're probably only taking another chip out of their local ecosystem to me , especially if they 're going to start doing it on a large scale and when have you ever known the chi - commies to do anything on a small scale ? when they go in on something , they always tend to go all - in so that does n't exactly bode well for the wasp population in that country or much of anything else that can fly & sting . honey bees are already having a tough enough time around the globe . in the end , this just looks like too much fun to resist though .
that 's what we need for the autonomous zones . no police injured .
now that ‚Äôs cool ! if it could only burn [[GPE]] virus out of the air !
i want one .
been using them in the [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] for [[DATE]] already . why is [[GPE]] just now catching up ? oh can anyone say copyright and patent infringement .
thanks for the idea . now i know what i want for [[DATE]] ! !
let 's not give [[GPE]] any more ideas ...
every [[NORP]] needs one of these ... they could use it to light their [[ORG]] , and burn down buildings in riots !
the cause of the next [[GPE]] wild wife
i wonder if the [[GPE]] uses drones to control our killer bee population , or tent worms , etc . seems like a good idea
does this work on red houses in the states ?
[[PERSON]] for [[CARDINAL]] of these ‚Ä¶ .
skynet larvae
the emperor of [[GPE]] at [[CARDINAL]] glorious feast had [[CARDINAL]] hummingbird tongues served at his feast . the [[NORP]] have been raping the [[LOC]] for [[DATE]] , the reason it so polluted . many people are unaware that root vegetables from [[GPE]] like [[PERSON]] , have high concentrations of heavy metals , like lead . the [[NORP]] poisoned themselves ,
why did n‚Äôt [[GPE]] just send a virus ? ? !
ummm , yes please .
[[PERSON]] is owned by the [[NORP]] . enjoy your rice drone served up by the master / owners . ! ! !
[[GPE]] destroying the planet -- [[ORDINAL]] with pollution , and now by killing insects . where are all the tree - huggers ? !
fly like a butterfly , sting like a dragon . üî•
i 've used the same principle with wasp nests for [[DATE]] . if you can access the nests near your house ( obviously not nests way up in the trees ) , wait till [[TIME]] when the wasps have returned home and are resting . get a long lighter , the kind used for your fireplace . put that in your off hand and light it . get a can of lysol and put it in your strong hand behind the lighter . aim toward the nest and direct the spray slightly above the flame so as not to extinguish it . you do n't have to burn the nest down . all you have to do is singe the wings of the wasps so that they ca n't fly . then when you 've got them all , just knock the nest down and discard it . works like a charm if you do it right .
sprays fire ... and can also spray viruses .
the [[GPE]] has drones that can fire a pinpoint projectile from a long ways away and take out just about anything . that ‚Äôs why the us [[ORG]] program is so important . to keep our enemies from deploying drones with our capabilities . satellites üõ∞ are the key to everything drone .
i bet magas want those for [[DATE]] . here 's my list : [[PERSON]] , [[GPE]] 's virus creating military , [[PERSON]] , [[PERSON]] , dog eating folks ( worldwide ) , u.s._those right / left zombies that assault people because who they support politically .
" wasp , hornet , what 's the difference ? " ~the editor
the [[ORG]] could use this technology for crowd control at voter line ups . suppress the vote at all costs .
i want one , nope , make that [[CARDINAL]] !
this shows promise . i can see it being used whenever statues are pulled down or people begin " peaceful protests " by burning buildings . those skateboards and baseball bats would suddenly self - immolate and the " protesters " would wonder if god is sending them a message ... üòá
that s nothing , , , , , go to you tube and look at the chain saw drone made in [[GPE]] !
i want [[CARDINAL]] !
i 've used the long pole with a piece of old cloth and gasoline method , more than once . this invention overcomes range limitations .
[[PERSON]] says that we are escalating the war with wasps and in [[DATE]] in office he intends to start an apologetic tour .
uh , cruel and unusual ?
next riot in [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] , do you think the [[NORP]] will loan this to us ?
a practical invention .
another torture device to reign down on the unsuspecting citizens .
there is a huge market for these in [[GPE]] .
it was just a test run for dealing with [[GPE]] demonstrations .
what could possibly go wrong ?
every creature unto heaven has a purpose . the wasps in my state , eats lots of insects and very few people get fatally sick from these bug catchers . let [[GPE]] reap a huge increase in bugs and insects , as they tried to tinker with the natural order of the world . the [[NORP]] are not as smart as they once were , when they cherished [[ORG]] .
now if they can just get a little nasty virus in one .
hot item for [[DATE]] sales ! big demand for them drom [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , and [[ORG]] .
if it can spray gasoline , it can spray [[ORG]] gas ....
what a great tool for [[GPE]] and the next dnc convention .
just think , if [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] got a hold of a few of these drones they could torch cities like [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] in just a matter of [[TIME]] . . . all at the same time .
scary thought , the [[NORP]] could use swarms of those drones on a battlefield , and the other side could do little to protect themselves .
they probably collected their dna too before they fired it up
always got to have a feel good story about jina each day right fox . orange man bad , jina good
betcha that drone would be great for [[GPE]] - who knows - the [[NORP]] might already be using them there to burn our crops
[[ORG]] and [[ORG]] can get many ideas from the pic . a fire breathing drone , piles of brush for fuel to burn , and lotsa loose bricks ...
do you ever feel like a wasp ? you should , because the [[NORP]] ccp considers you an insect . they ‚Äôre advertising a capability .
the drone uses [[PRODUCT]] missiles .
the [[ORDINAL]] thing i thought when i saw the article was , this is the perfect means of crowd control . obviously a lot of others had the same idea . imagine several of these things swooping around the sky during a [[ORG]] or antifa " protest " . it would be better than a flock of attack trained bald eagles .
best time to destroy hives is when the sun goes down .
brilliant idea .
they are testing a similar drone that can be inserted into an artery and it floats around to flame out covid virus . patients have reported a very warm feeling and have auto - response where they call the fire department [[TIME]] .
do they eat them next ?
that is [[CARDINAL]] way of doing it alright ! good for them . ingenuity at its best !
a very minor platform modification and this becomes a serious weapon . they only show the " good " side .
a shotgun would work petty good .
that 's all we need is for those drones to get in the lunatic antifa or terrorists hands .
that 's pretty hot !
with technology like that it will not be long where we could send a dealybob to the moon and kill bees in nests there .
wonderful . but for everyone 's sake please do n't make it available in [[GPE]] . those dorks will burn the entire state down .
they would n't do this for normal wasps , so is it for [[PERSON]] ? that would explain where those things came from .
the [[GPE]] police could use some tear gas carrying drones for those uncontrollable barbaric lunatic protests by the [[ORG]] and blm .
can we borrow it ? asking for a friend in [[GPE]] .
has their drone been burning houses in ca ?
shoulda had that in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .
this was shown online [[DATE]] ..... and it was in the [[GPE]]
more [[GPE]] technology stolen by the [[NORP]] , thank you hunter .
[[PERSON]] 's crack pipe lighter .
can we get some of those drones and send them to [[GPE]] ?
how about we just be happy that this is a safe way to destroy the nest . maybe when the killer wasp continues to spread in the [[GPE]] we can use this instead of humans . great job
wasps eat the caterpillars . under the idiot mao , once they killed all the sparrows . rather than being increased , rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased .
wonder what [[GPE]] company [[GPE]] stole that drone technology from ... ?
every life has a purpose . if it is n't bothering you , leave it alone . those wasps high up in the trees would never bother anyone . no need to kill them just because you have an irrational fear of them . a local neighbor was inquiring if someone knew of a service to remove a hornets nest , and she included a photo of the nest , you could barely see it high up in a tree . never would have bothered anyone , yet she wanted someone to kill them . do n't get me wrong , i 'm a hunter . i believe that you should be able to hunt , as long as you use what you harvest . but just indiscriminately killing every part of nature that you do n't happen to like is just wrong . every living thing evolved for a reason . take them away and the parts of nature that they interact with also suffer .
and just in time for [[DATE]]
[[ORG]] and [[ORG]] have ordered a few . [[PERSON]] is much easier now .
w.a.s.p 's in [[GPE]] ? go figure ! lol
i always knew the [[NORP]] government had no respect for people , now it appears they feel the same way about wasps
i want [[CARDINAL]] for [[DATE]] and to use on the rioters at the next antifa protest ..
i want one .
just what the world needed . a new way to burn down forests and homes . of course it would start in [[GPE]] .
where 's the video ?
i wonder if it works on the emerald ash borer ? oops , too late ...
wow ! i want one !
[[ORG]] and [[ORG]] just placed an order for [[CARDINAL]] each !
nifty little deal . wait until they start attaching an ar15 to this little puppy for riot control . yikes .
to the wasps , it must have been like watching a giant alien mother ship hovering about their nest and firing laser torpedoes .
looks like a hornet 's nest .
use that thing to torch the new chop zone in [[GPE]]
also works on uighurs and [[PERSON]] paperwork
sounds like a good idea to me . they should spray gasoline over the whole country and throw a match on it .
the chicoms and [[GPE]] come to mind after reading this article
now we know how those godless communists dealt with all their covid patients .
ok , now that the wasps are toast they can re - install the cameras and get it back to spying on the population .
i can imagine this being used for crowd control .
soon to be used for crowd control . [[ORDINAL]] in [[GPE]] then ? ? ?
where were these guys during the [[ORG]] protest and antifa riots ?
" ok , [[PERSON]] , it 's works , now let 's formulate our plan on how to use it against the [[GPE]] "
now you do n't have to worry about wasps , guess that 'll make the concentration camps a little easier to live in now .
hope they can tell the difference between a wasp nest and a squirrel nest .
this will end about as well as [[EVENT]] . but do n't worry - it 's just the ecological balance you 're messing with .
maybe we could get a battalion of these to direct at [[ORG]] !
