If you can access the nests near your house (obviously not nests way up in the trees), wait till early evening when the wasps have returned home and are resting.

Get a can of Lysol and put it in your strong hand behind the lighter.\n\nAim toward the nest and direct the spray slightly above the flame so as not to extinguish it.\n\nYou don't have to burn the nest down.  All you have to do is singe the wings of the wasps so that they can't fly. Then when you've got them all, just knock the nest down and discard it.\n\nWorks like a charm if you do it right.",

Seems like they're probably only taking another chip out of their local ecosystem to me, especially if they're going to start doing it on a large scale and when have you ever known the chi-commies to do anything on a small scale?  When they go in on something, they always tend to go all-in so that doesn't exactly bode well for the wasp population in that country or much of anything else that can fly & sting.

On the third day, at night, soak the nest with wasp spray to get any remaining wasps.  Use your wet vac to suck it up.  I have never gotten stung.  Just have patience.
