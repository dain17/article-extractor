Once can only speculate - but I'd imagine they let Putin do this to get rid of him and his regime. Zelenskyy was bait and tossed under the bus.

But the idea was stopped cold over the administration's worries about escalation.\n\nIn December 2021, senior U.S. military officials told lawmakers that they wanted to send a ‚Äúfew hundred‚Äù additional special operations personnel to Ukraine to provide military advice and training on unconventional warfare. At the time, Russia had amassed roughly 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, and concerns were growing in Washington and Europe about a broadening invasion.\n\nBut White House officials had concerns about the deployment and the troops were never sent, according to two people familiar with the two December briefings with lawmakers and congressional aides. They also said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin planned to directly press President Joe Biden to approve the mission.\n\nA senior military official told House lawmakers that the White House was concerned that sending the troops would escalate the already tense situation with Russia, according to the two people. A third congressional official told POLITICO that a Pentagon official briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee that plans had been scrapped due to those concerns.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-",

In an impassioned address to a joint session of Congress ‚Äî with Biden sitting directly behind him ‚Äî Poroshenko said his country appreciated the nonlethal assistance he was getting, but declared ‚Äúone cannot win a war with blankets.‚Äù\n\nThe Obama-Biden administration was unmoved. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that ‚ÄúPresident Barack Obama stuck to his refusal to provide weapons or other lethal military gear to Ukraine.‚Äù Why?\n\nTeam Obama feared that lethal aid would provoke Moscow.\n\nSo what did the administration give him? Instead of rocket-propelled grenades, we provided food rations. As one frustrated former Pentagon official put it at the time, ‚ÄúWhat kind of message does that send anyway?‚Äù\n\nAnswer: a message of weakness.\n\nWhen Trump took office, he delivered a message of strength. In December 2017, the new administration announced that the United States would send the lethal aid to Ukraine that Poroshenko requested and Obama and Biden refused ‚Äî the sale of $47 million worth of Javelin antitank missiles.\n\nIn May 2018, after Ukraine tested its new Javelin missiles, Poroshenko exulted on Twitter ‚ÄúFinally this day has come!‚Äù and personally thanked Trump",

And the longer it goes, the more opportunity for it to spin out of control with the potential to kill hundreds of millions, fatally wound or poison a billion more, starve another billion, and those unlucky enough to have survived all that will enter into some kind of bizarre stone age where they will be tasked with restarting something resembling civilization.\n\nFrom another piece yesterday: \"In a statement that seemed to signal potential grounds for agreement with Moscow, Zelenskyy told European leaders gathered in London that he realizes NATO has no intention of accepting Ukraine. Zelenskyy has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he could consider a neutral status for his country.\"\n\nWhy not encourage him to float that out there? If not, why not? Worse that can happen is all parties stay on the same path they're already on.",

The White House has made duplicitous claims about Russia and Putin being a madman while they are threatening democracy in the Ukraine. The opposite is true. Russia is a democratic Republic with free elections. The Ukraine is not. They have a US installed puppet government that is paying Hunter Biden a half million dollars a year for his personality (influence peddling). The sad part about the duplicity of the US is that a lot of innocent people of the Ukraine are dying over the prompting of the US in those 8 years to point US made guns at the Russians and how the \"aid money\" got distributed among the puppet government members.

It's not a matter of IF American and NATO troops will face Putin's forces, it's a matter of WHEN, and if you ask me (not that anyone did) it's better to face him down now while his forces are overextended and demoralized.  His aims are clear - restore the Soviet Union.  We're already committed, the die is cast; it's just a matter of whether we want to fight a weaker or stronger Putin.",

See the difference between a leader and blackmailing lying orange traitor yet America? Joe is leading the country to defend democracy and the republicans are doing everything in their power to destroy it. Book banning's, laws against women's rights, laws against LGBTQ rights, their own private election police force, laws against minorities, attack after attack on voting rights. Republicans tell you they are for small government and people's freedoms, but they have taken more freedom away from Americans in the past five years, than any time in history. They want Putin's government, with them in charge. Just sayin.",
