they should be charged with exposing themselves and have to be registered as sex offenders .
[[DATE]] i got in a conversation in a bar with a guy who was passing through town on his way to a nudist convention . i commented that i was too inhibited to feel comfortable at such an event . he said there was nothing like partying with [[CARDINAL]] naked people .
wow ! it is ok for the city to be burned , rioting , shootings , etc , but heaven forbid the police use drones to take pictures of people violating a law they created then they do n't like that . talk about being totally out of touch with the community .
simple - stay home if you want to get naked . lay in your own back yard , on a private deck if you do n't have a back yard , or lay in the sun that shines through a window . also ... why do blacks feel the need to lay in the sun , tanning ?
we read about a robbery they show proof with video or pictures . we read about a murder we get the same . but absolutely no evidence shown to the viewers . how can we be certain this is a true story ?
it 's handled by the same government agency that faked the moon landing .
[[CARDINAL]] words . zoom lens
why are " [[ORG]] " spying on people out by a lake ? should n't they be organizing some yute basketball leagues to give the locals something to do besides [[ORG]] ?
not some yute ; the " keeidz " from da ' hood .
det . sgt . [[PERSON]] they call aka " [[PERSON]] " for a reason . also known for wearing out the rewind and pause buttons .
[[GPE]] was once a great city filled with hard workers , innovators , business leaders , and common sense . now its totally opposite . filled with nothing but [[ORG]] members . black , professional , victim , league .
fiddling with drones ... while [[GPE]] burns ...
glad that the city council is keeping their finger on the pulse of what 's important while the city burns .
once you go out into the public you surrender you privacy .
" ... if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay ... " a citation is n't a pronouncement of guilt . if it goes to court they will have to show the video of her [[ORDINAL]] pair of eyes to her an the jury but having already seen the video , they had enough to cite her for it .
no , but if use any device i think you need to show the video . after all if a device records my speed , i get to see the numbers . and you should be able to see the evidence before the hearing .
you can get caught speeding by a plane . they do n't have to show you anything at that time to issue a ticket . they have to prove it in court .
[[GPE]] keeping [[ORDINAL]] things [[ORDINAL]] .
what s the big deal about seeing ladies breasts just go down town and see all you want
> > > if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay . " > > > then go to court and argue your case . you do n't get to " demand " anything , sweety . you do n't get to demand the footage of the camera that busted you selling drugs , either . you go to trial and present your case ... they'll present theirs . that 's how it works , kid .
[[FAC]] is where all evidence is presented to the court and gets the ok to use in the hearing .
what are you talking about ? before the trial you are supposed to get access / see the evidence against you . and yes you do get to demand the evidence . all the evidence is some thing you get to see , and before trial . at your [[ORDINAL]] appear in front of the judge the police are legally required to say there is proof you may have committed a crime . and if that proof is video , at the least they say it is proof you committed a crime . every state has varied rules of evidence on video evidence . drone footage must be properly entered as evidence .
i found this story quite titillating . i hope [[ORG]] keeps us abreast of any further developments .
i hope [[ORG]] will get to the bottom of this issue of unauthorized [[PERSON]] .
i bet they will milk this story for all it is worth
you win the internet [[DATE]] !
those cops were just loving the view ! since they are impotent with the rioters they might as well try to see chicks !
pelosi would spill out [[CARDINAL]] ft . on each side ! ! perfect for social distancing ! ! lol
i would be tempted to poke my eyes out .
do n't know about that ? ? i 'm thinking it would aggravate her knee problems though ! !
[[ORG]] .. make breast great again !
some of the footage carried on all the way too the knees , to prove topless bathing . [[PERSON]] !
no pics or video - fake media fake news
ok , i 'm standing here bare - beamed and buck necked . prove to me your drone ( [[ORG]] actually ) saw me bare - beamed and buck necked .
so we insist on our right to be nude in public , law to the contrary , but we demand our privacy and are offended if anyone peeks . [[ORG]] . got it .
that is what the fence straddling whiner 's do ! !
there are those who 'd suggest your privacy is in the beach bag with your bra and pants .
if the drone is flying erratically , usually a indication of ' [[CARDINAL]] - handed ' piloting
sounds like somebody has too firm a grip on the [[PRODUCT]] ...
this is both clever and terrible ...
errrr .... thanks ? ?
it was a compliment ... :)
lol police guys name was [[ORG]] .... ( look it up )
( d ) will be legalizing prostitution soon
and who exactly gave the approval for the police to conduct this operation , mayor ( * & ! for brains [[WORK_OF_ART]] , [[PERSON]] ? i would think the [[GPE]] police have many things much higher on the priority list to get done ! ! ! ! come on brown , you came from [[GPE]] , put your common sense hat back on , strap that pair back on , get real .
uh , this was in [[GPE]] .
same same
[[CARDINAL]] shootings and [[CARDINAL]] deaths by gun since [[FAC]] in [[GPE]] . mayor [[PERSON]] has his finger on the pulse .
[[CARDINAL]] homicides as of [[DATE]] .
i thought rectum was a medical term ? ? i was deleted for using it ? ? i still think that is where he checks his pulse ! !
follow the rules and you wo n't have a problem
while walking along the beach in [[GPE]] ca i came upon a nude beach , there is no way i would want to see any video of anyone on that beach , just a whole lot of saggies , baggies , and not for me . but if that 's your thing go for it .
det . sgt . [[PERSON]] defended the action . i 'll bet he did . free the tittie 's !
if i stare at a woman she can claim sexual harassment but a woman can be in public half naked ? why does your morality top the morality of the majority ? i do not care but others do . they should be respected . put your clothes on in public .
no matter where it is it 's now a surveillance state .
protecting the community . why not hire everyone with a drone and peep on everyone .
their working on that ! ! manning up a revival version of the [[ORG]] .. they will have everybody snitching on everybody else shortly ! !
there is already to much surveillance in this country .
pictures please !
do n’t get too excited i saw those girls and they were all very ugly
[[GPE]] ? is n't nude sunbathing against [[WORK_OF_ART]] law ?
yes . according to the [[WORK_OF_ART]] any man who sees a woman nude ( other than one of his wives ) must commit suicide .
cops do n't want to reveal what they 've been zooming in on .......... so they had to make it legal ... classic .
it was in public space , where judicial rulings unanimously concur that there 's no reasonable expectation of privacy .
since [[GPE]] banned them from actually policing criminals now , they can issue tickets . ordinance has been on the books , just not enforced . [[PERSON]] law enforcement .
i heard they have a new anti bicycle theft squad - however not to infringe on the citizens rights police can only take pictures of the arm up to the elbow taking the bike . so far no arrests have been made . ;)
i figured racism would play a part in the story , ca nt have a story without racism [[DATE]] .
just white women in the video .. is that racist enough for you ? ?
but we all really need the media to explain to us how the [[PERSON]] directly affects [[WORK_OF_ART]] " ...
typical liberals . they put laws on the books , hire people to enforce them , and then cry when they are enforced . " those laws were meant for other people , not me ... "
these kinds of laws are the bedrock of [[NORP]] conservatives . being busybodies often is their main mission :) .
i 'm a [[NORP]] , fairly conservative , a former nudist camp member and i 'm in favor of [[ORG]] among consenting adults . i do n't care what you do in your bedroom or other private places and i see nothing wrong with public nudity in a secluded environment , not on main street at high noon . live and let live , do n't force other people to conform to your beliefs . keep the kids out and away . shut down the drones , light up , shoot up , drink up , just do n't bother other people who are enjoying themselves in different ways .
it 's public decency laws , especially since the ones that go topless at places like that are far from decent , or decent - looking .
how would you know this ? ? ? did a friend tell you ? ? please post picture so the rest of us can decide if you are decent enough to be on a topless beach . probably not .
people should n't have to be exposed to your ugly self in public places .
you sound like [[ORG]] , say [[CARDINAL]] thing , and then turn around say something else when the original argument falls flat :)
you sound like a deranged person we used to be smart enough , as a society , to lock away in an asylum . go find one and check yourself in .
wearing clothes is a personal choice and demanding that i wear a piece of cloth over my private areas violates my freedom . i 'll still wear a mask , because that could save lives , but clothes ? that 's oppression ! ! !
now that this story is on the web they are going to need some form of air traffic control to manage the drone traffic .
why do n't they just cancel all of the laws , fire all of the police and just surrender already . the city of [[GPE]] is just a disgrace and a failure .
that 's [[ORG]] 's [[ORG]] act ! she wants to apply it to the entire usa .
wrong district .
what , no pics ? i call fake nudes !
i do n't care about the nudity , but the drug use and boozing at a public beach needs to be stepped on .
[[GPE]] now wants to promote rape . rioting , looting and arson were n't enough , now they will encourage sexual offenses as non - crimes . it 's just as well repealing the anti - nudity laws ; with [[PERSON]] shorts and mini - skirts , there is n't much left for the imagination .
soon the city will have [[PERSON]] at the end of its name
[[GPE]]
which sounds like mini apple stand .
nudes at [[CARDINAL]]
“ it does make you feel uncomfortable to just think like , oh , how often am i being watched ? and what kind of authority is going on here ? ” said [[PERSON]] , who was written up for topless sunbathing . " than how about not having you stuff out on display in public if you 're concerned about being watched , brainlet ? also , it often shows the only ones that go topless at places like these are those that really , really shouldn't .... imagine rainbow - haired trigglypuffs [[QUANTITY]] hanging out ... eeehhh ...
being naked is fine as long as you wear that mask !
oh good , comments are open here !
take no action against these ladies ! the men yes . now that is a violation of lewdness . unless the males hide their private parts somewhere within the ladies .
many could be described as human art . not counting the ones looking like old drained wine skins , better left covered .
the point of going buck naked is to have people stare . drone surveillance is like the ultimate in exhibition .
no , most people who remove their clothes just feel it 's a good way to relax .
i wonder how much of the video is posted on line and what the cost to watch is . nice sideline for the cops !
you can watch the same thing for free . there are many videos about dairy farming on that popular video platform available free .
[[PERSON]] , they 've got some big ones too !
this happens when the police have nothing better to do .
do n't put laws on the books if you do n't want them enforced .
a naked human body can be ugly if not retouched [[ORDINAL]] .
what if all the women who were topless just said that they identified as men . the police would have no case or cause for fines or arrests
so good to know they are focused on the important stuff rather than controlling riots or arson and such .
" [ we were ] just chilling , enjoying a day of not doing community work , trying to relax at the beach , " i wonder what they did last time that they got sentenced to community service for .
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and ny are running neck to neck being the worst states in the union . anything goes .
[[GPE]] is n't doing that bad either .
i understand if a male was topless and had moobs they should be arrested , however women as long as they are [[DATE]] and weigh [[CARDINAL]] , they should be allowed to go topless . and if i do n't see pictures or video it did n't happen .
people have to realize that this is a whole lot less like the si swimsuit issue and a whole like more like [[LAW]] .
moo
exactly .
ok , these are the same people that are adamant about defunding the police , really , spying on sun bathers . how 's a girl suppose to brown properly ? you would think they have more pressing issues . [[NORP]] .
get out your personal drone and drop that drone that the tax payers paid for so that the cops can stop getting their rocks off . pull the top gun on these idiots .
they must be gay/
no doubt they are gay .
film and pictures at [[TIME]] . stay tuned .
got to get my new done from [[ORG]] delivered .
i am so glad [[NORP]] is dealing with this instead of petty issues .... ? ?
where is the video ?
it was a gay party bro . still want the video ?
gay females ?
" i do n't like that , " [[PERSON]] said . " if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay . " if you challenge the citation in court the police have to provide the evidence against you . so simply contest the citation and you will see what they have against you . you were in a public area , there is no expectation of privacy so to bad so sad grow up .
flew over [[PERSON]] place and cited her for a naked goat .
hey , it is what she was doing to the goat with [[ORG]] ! !
lol send a $ [[MONEY]] drone to spy on me and i 'm going to shoot it down , probably they guy who launched it as well .
use [[CARDINAL]] of the small $ [[MONEY]] drones and fly it into the one spying on you . down will come both of them .
you 'll go to prison for that .
i don't care
you will when you meet [[PERSON]] .
if you are in public you have no expectation of privacy as scotus has repeatedly stated .
people have done that and paid for the drone plus a fine
oh , but what a rush that would be . well worth the $ $
ca n't get blood from a stone
but they can put you in jail . it 's a federal crime to shoot one .
i don't care
oh , the collections agencies will try . relentlessly . for [[DATE]] after [[DATE]] after [[DATE]] .
