they should be charged with exposing themselves and have to be registered as sex offenders .
[[DATE]] i got in a conversation in a bar with a guy who was passing through town on his way to a nudist convention . i commented that i was too inhibited to feel comfortable at such an event . he said there was nothing like partying with [[CARDINAL]] naked people .
wow ! it is ok for the city to be burned , rioting , shootings , etc , but heaven forbid the police use drones to take pictures of people violating a law they created then they do n't like that . talk about being totally out of touch with the community .
simple - stay home if you want to get naked . lay in your own back yard , on a private deck if you do n't have a back yard , or lay in the sun that shines through a window . also ... why do blacks feel the need to lay in the sun , tanning ?
we read about a robbery they show proof with video or pictures . we read about a murder we get the same . but absolutely no evidence shown to the viewers . how can we be certain this is a true story ?
[[CARDINAL]] words . zoom lens
why are " [[ORG]] " spying on people out by a lake ? should n't they be organizing some yute basketball leagues to give the locals something to do besides [[ORG]] ?
det . sgt . [[PERSON]] they call aka " [[PERSON]] " for a reason . also known for wearing out the rewind and pause buttons .
[[GPE]] was once a great city filled with hard workers , innovators , business leaders , and common sense . now its totally opposite . filled with nothing but [[ORG]] members . black , professional , victim , league .
fiddling with drones ... while [[GPE]] burns ...
glad that the city council is keeping their finger on the pulse of what 's important while the city burns .
once you go out into the public you surrender you privacy .
" ... if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay ... " a citation is n't a pronouncement of guilt . if it goes to court they will have to show the video of her [[ORDINAL]] pair of eyes to her an the jury but having already seen the video , they had enough to cite her for it .
[[GPE]] keeping [[ORDINAL]] things [[ORDINAL]] .
what s the big deal about seeing ladies breasts just go down town and see all you want
> > > if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay . " > > > then go to court and argue your case . you do n't get to " demand " anything , sweety . you do n't get to demand the footage of the camera that busted you selling drugs , either . you go to trial and present your case ... they'll present theirs . that 's how it works , kid .
i found this story quite titillating . i hope [[ORG]] keeps us abreast of any further developments .
those cops were just loving the view ! since they are impotent with the rioters they might as well try to see chicks !
pelosi would spill out [[CARDINAL]] ft . on each side ! ! perfect for social distancing ! ! lol
[[ORG]] .. make breast great again !
some of the footage carried on all the way too the knees , to prove topless bathing . [[PERSON]] !
no pics or video - fake media fake news
ok , i 'm standing here bare - beamed and buck necked . prove to me your drone ( [[ORG]] actually ) saw me bare - beamed and buck necked .
so we insist on our right to be nude in public , law to the contrary , but we demand our privacy and are offended if anyone peeks . [[ORG]] . got it .
if the drone is flying erratically , usually a indication of ' [[CARDINAL]] - handed ' piloting
lol police guys name was [[ORG]] .... ( look it up )
( d ) will be legalizing prostitution soon
and who exactly gave the approval for the police to conduct this operation , mayor ( * & ! for brains [[WORK_OF_ART]] , [[PERSON]] ? i would think the [[GPE]] police have many things much higher on the priority list to get done ! ! ! ! come on brown , you came from [[GPE]] , put your common sense hat back on , strap that pair back on , get real .
[[CARDINAL]] shootings and [[CARDINAL]] deaths by gun since [[FAC]] in [[GPE]] . mayor [[PERSON]] has his finger on the pulse .
follow the rules and you wo n't have a problem
while walking along the beach in [[GPE]] ca i came upon a nude beach , there is no way i would want to see any video of anyone on that beach , just a whole lot of saggies , baggies , and not for me . but if that 's your thing go for it .
det . sgt . [[PERSON]] defended the action . i 'll bet he did . free the tittie 's !
if i stare at a woman she can claim sexual harassment but a woman can be in public half naked ? why does your morality top the morality of the majority ? i do not care but others do . they should be respected . put your clothes on in public .
no matter where it is it 's now a surveillance state .
protecting the community . why not hire everyone with a drone and peep on everyone .
pictures please !
do n’t get too excited i saw those girls and they were all very ugly
[[GPE]] ? is n't nude sunbathing against [[WORK_OF_ART]] law ?
cops do n't want to reveal what they 've been zooming in on .......... so they had to make it legal ... classic .
since [[GPE]] banned them from actually policing criminals now , they can issue tickets . ordinance has been on the books , just not enforced . [[PERSON]] law enforcement .
i figured racism would play a part in the story , ca nt have a story without racism [[DATE]] .
typical liberals . they put laws on the books , hire people to enforce them , and then cry when they are enforced . " those laws were meant for other people , not me ... "
wearing clothes is a personal choice and demanding that i wear a piece of cloth over my private areas violates my freedom . i 'll still wear a mask , because that could save lives , but clothes ? that 's oppression ! ! !
now that this story is on the web they are going to need some form of air traffic control to manage the drone traffic .
why do n't they just cancel all of the laws , fire all of the police and just surrender already . the city of [[GPE]] is just a disgrace and a failure .
what , no pics ? i call fake nudes !
i do n't care about the nudity , but the drug use and boozing at a public beach needs to be stepped on .
[[GPE]] now wants to promote rape . rioting , looting and arson were n't enough , now they will encourage sexual offenses as non - crimes . it 's just as well repealing the anti - nudity laws ; with [[PERSON]] shorts and mini - skirts , there is n't much left for the imagination .
soon the city will have [[PERSON]] at the end of its name
nudes at [[CARDINAL]]
“ it does make you feel uncomfortable to just think like , oh , how often am i being watched ? and what kind of authority is going on here ? ” said [[PERSON]] , who was written up for topless sunbathing . " than how about not having you stuff out on display in public if you 're concerned about being watched , brainlet ? also , it often shows the only ones that go topless at places like these are those that really , really shouldn't .... imagine rainbow - haired trigglypuffs [[QUANTITY]] hanging out ... eeehhh ...
being naked is fine as long as you wear that mask !
oh good , comments are open here !
take no action against these ladies ! the men yes . now that is a violation of lewdness . unless the males hide their private parts somewhere within the ladies .
many could be described as human art . not counting the ones looking like old drained wine skins , better left covered .
the point of going buck naked is to have people stare . drone surveillance is like the ultimate in exhibition .
i wonder how much of the video is posted on line and what the cost to watch is . nice sideline for the cops !
this happens when the police have nothing better to do .
a naked human body can be ugly if not retouched [[ORDINAL]] .
what if all the women who were topless just said that they identified as men . the police would have no case or cause for fines or arrests
so good to know they are focused on the important stuff rather than controlling riots or arson and such .
" [ we were ] just chilling , enjoying a day of not doing community work , trying to relax at the beach , " i wonder what they did last time that they got sentenced to community service for .
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and ny are running neck to neck being the worst states in the union . anything goes .
i understand if a male was topless and had moobs they should be arrested , however women as long as they are [[DATE]] and weigh [[CARDINAL]] , they should be allowed to go topless . and if i do n't see pictures or video it did n't happen .
people have to realize that this is a whole lot less like the si swimsuit issue and a whole like more like [[LAW]] .
ok , these are the same people that are adamant about defunding the police , really , spying on sun bathers . how 's a girl suppose to brown properly ? you would think they have more pressing issues . [[NORP]] .
get out your personal drone and drop that drone that the tax payers paid for so that the cops can stop getting their rocks off . pull the top gun on these idiots .
film and pictures at [[TIME]] . stay tuned .
got to get my new done from [[ORG]] delivered .
i am so glad [[NORP]] is dealing with this instead of petty issues .... ? ?
where is the video ?
" i do n't like that , " [[PERSON]] said . " if you come up to me right now and tell me [[TIME]] , i was doing something but you wo n't provide any proof and that 's enough to get me in trouble , i do n't think that 's okay . " if you challenge the citation in court the police have to provide the evidence against you . so simply contest the citation and you will see what they have against you . you were in a public area , there is no expectation of privacy so to bad so sad grow up .
flew over [[PERSON]] place and cited her for a naked goat .
lol send a $ [[MONEY]] drone to spy on me and i 'm going to shoot it down , probably they guy who launched it as well .
