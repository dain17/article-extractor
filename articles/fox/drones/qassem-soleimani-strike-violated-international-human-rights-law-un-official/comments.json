In fact, Obama stopped using the air force for drone strikes entirely and opted for using the CIA instead so that they could be kept secret from everyone, including congress.\n\nThis was a very measured, very strong response.  The only other options were to either hit targets that are actually on Iranian soil which would be too strong or to just hit more, random Iranian backed militias which would be too weak.  Soleimani was a nice piece to take off the board and we didn't have to go into Iran to do it, that's about as good of a response as we could've hoped for and it was done immediately so it can't be mistaken for anything other than retaliation, also a good thing.",
