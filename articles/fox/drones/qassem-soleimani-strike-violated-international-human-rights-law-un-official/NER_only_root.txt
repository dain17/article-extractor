i stopped reading at [[ORG]] [[PRODUCT]] .
hey ... agnes .... go back to your cats and knitting ..... don't talk about things and people will forget you exist again like they have always done .
cut off [[GPE]] funds to [[ORG]] now !
tell his replacement to stay in [[GPE]] !
this is all you need to know about this person ................. director , global freedom of expression , [[ORG]] ; [[ORG]] on [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] the [[ORG]] . we need to pull out of it with [[MONEY]] of our [[MONEY]] , and kick it out of [[GPE]] they do nothing to end , fight terrorism , bad mouthing the [[CARDINAL]] country that has put itself on the line all the time .
the bowel movement i just had has more relevance than the [[ORG]] .
" callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” " [[ORG]] , sorry . our bad .
agnes , do you realize that you guys would be speaking [[NORP]] if it was n't for the [[GPE]] , sleep on that .
where were the [[ORG]] 's objections when an [[NORP]] contractor was killed and our embassy in [[GPE]] was violated by [[NORP]] militia ?
[[ORG]] from the [[ORG]] said .... what ? who [[ORG]] ?
the [[ORG]] is only concerned about " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " when we take out terrorists .
sit down and shut up , [[ORG]] . the adults are dealing with the situation .
oops , sorry . yeah , that one got away from us .
with her logic , she should be speaking [[NORP]] .
[[ORG]] .
yeah , sorry [[LOC]] . that one got away from us .
another show of support from the liberal [[NORP]] . smh
time to tell the [[ORG]] to move out and get lost for good .
[[MONEY]] @$ the [[ORG]] ... corrupt organization with corrupt people in it
this is rich coming from the official country of surrender .
“ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” this alone is enough reason why we [[PERSON]] to get rid of [[ORG]]
hey agnes , where was your concern when [[NORP]] backed forces attacked our [[GPE]] embassy ? another great example of why we need to quit the [[ORG]] and kick the whole mess out of the [[GPE]] . what a worthless bunch of nobodies !
the [[ORG]] 's greatest success ? ummmmmmm ... [[GPE]] ? or is it all those babies your guys fathered in [[GPE]] ?
^^^looks to the left , looks to the right , looks straight ahead , can not see anyone who gives a darn about what this woman says .
time to remove ourselves from the [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] . they have outlived their usefulness to us and are a drain on our wallet .
and the crazy opinion of some fool means what to the family of the [[NORP]] contractor killed ? also pretty sure [[NORP]] lead a known and defined terrorist organization and he himself was listed as a terrorist . yep justification box checked . thank god no one cares about the [[NORP]] especially in matters of defense and war . track record they have is a little spotty ! !
time to boot the useless [[ORG]] .
more proof that the [[ORG]] needs to be moved out of the [[GPE]] ... let it go to [[GPE]] .
i ’m confused how many drone attacks by obama were there ? the [[ORG]] an anti semitic organization !
all i have to say is ............................. pound sand !
[[ORG]] , the [[ORG]] is a joke .
" callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” " then what is ?
legal ? ? ? ? it 's war .... all is fair in war
for [[DATE]] now , i felt [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] have become useless , and more of a money grab from countries . not real sure what they do anymore other than to say " we condemn ... " , heck , i can not even remember when i seen the blue helmets last , it has been so long .
i suppose all the brave [[NORP]] servicemen that this butcher is responsible for murdering do n’t matter to this woman . what will it take for the [[ORG]] to figure out they do n’t control [[GPE]] , and we do n’t care what they say ? that monster was a terrorist and he got what he deserved . it was long overdue .
ok we 're sorry , you can have [[NORP]] back , give us back our missle .
see the part at the end where it says [[NORP]] ? tells you all you need to know . those are the same people who have destroyed the [[ORG]] with their liberal agenda
what do you do , [[LOC]] , when a mosquito keeps annoying you ? you swat it . [[GPE]] is nothing more than a mosquito that will continue to murder until it is crushed . the airstrike was an entirely appropriate response to [[NORP]] aggression .
so its just the drone that bothers her ? lol .. a bullet ok ? all is fair in love [[ORG]] ..
so now the [[ORG]] wants to condemn us for attacking a the top general of the enemy force which invaded [[GPE]] territory and tried to kill innocent [[NORP]] ? are we really supposed to take that seriously ?
the [[ORG]] is the reason , we have to take out garbage , like [[NORP]] !
[[NORP]] diplomat . [[ORG]] said .
[[GPE]] embassy was attacked and that is enough justification . the [[ORG]] needs to find another country to set up their crying and bellyaching . it 's a waste of our money for them to be located in this country .
" get the [[GPE]] out of the ' united ' nations now ! ! hey ... if the [[NORP]] can do it ( i.e. , [[PERSON]] ) , why ca n't we pull the plug on the [[ORG]] ?
[[ORG]] - important , [[ORG]] - effective , not [[ORG]] - biased .
who gives a damn what the [[ORG]] thinks ?
" sanction me with your army . " -black [[PERSON]]
so .... welcome to the new age of war ? why would n't a country use drones instead of sending humans in there ? seriously .
[[GPE]] kills their protesters , [[GPE]] kills their protesters , [[ORG]] kills their protesters , [[GPE]] makes dissenters disappear . [[GPE]] just lets our protesters- [[ORG]] , gives them news coverage ..
get us out of th [[ORG]] ! and kick it out of the [[GPE]] ! it was formed because they needed us , not the other way around . at least the majority of [[NORP]] u understood the [[GPE]] was screwing them and kissed them goodbye . wake up [[NORP]] !
uh huh ...... other than bloviate a bunch of hot air on twitter what exactly can you or the [[ORG]] do about it ? absolutely nothing . the man was a terrorist organizing terrorism in an active war zone . he got everything he had coming to him .
sorry , [[ORG]] , but this guy was a terrorist with the blood of [[CARDINAL]] on his hands . in addition , he was banned by [[ORG]] in [[DATE]] from international travel so he should not have been in [[GPE]] in the [[ORDINAL]] place . save your pity for his victims .
callamard , sit down and shut up .........
[[ORG]] .. [[ORG]] .
we 'll send flowers .
the useless nations can move if it does not like it .
should have had a “ beer summit ” .
[[ORG]] hoo ... where was the [[ORG]] when [[NORP]] backed terrorists killed the [[NORP]] contractor ? i 'm sick of hearing how [[GPE]] is , [[ORDINAL]] and foremost , wrong .
yet the [[ORG]] does nothing against [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] countries who constantly abuse human rights .
the [[ORG]] is a corrupt , self - serving organization that has bullied and blackmailed the [[GPE]] from the start . career politicians who simply want to keep hold of their jobs , their power and well - hidden wealth have always be intimidated by their criminal rhetoric . [[ORG]] has outlived its purpose , its integrity and its principles .
why do we still support the [[ORG]] ? why do we give them a place to meet and all the perks , and a bunch of money [[DATE]] . time to kick them all out and use those huge buildings for something positive for [[NORP]] .
she 's [[NORP]] , big surprise . the [[NORP]] foreign policy of " surrender at all cost " has clouded her statement .
the [[ORG]] has been irrelevant for [[DATE]] ! !
do nt pull out of the [[ORG]] , just stop giving them money
the [[ORG]] violates the definition of logic
if we want a [[GPE]] embassy to exist in [[GPE]] then it is necessary that we put a stop to the forces who are supporting attacks on both our property and personnel located at those locations . if someone were to have attacked the [[ORG]] building , i doubt the [[ORG]] would call a retaliation of that attack a " human rights violation . " maybe the cost of rebuilding our embassy should be subtracted from the funds we normally provide to the [[ORG]] .
[[NORP]] .... say no more and never again .
[[GPE]] strike violated [[NORP]] / general 's human rights ? what about the human rights of our civilians ( contractors ) and soldiers ? ? clearly , [[ORG]] caught [[GPE]] 's extremist ( and lying ) theocratic dictatorship red handed . i do n't think that glasshole general was there for a social call ....
this is the proper approach no need to go to war with the people just assassinate the military leaders and it 's over
this comes from a [[NORP]] official .... who 's country needed to be saved [[CARDINAL]] times from fascist enemies .. [[ORG]] and [[EVENT]] . does anyone actually take her seriously ? i don't.
the [[ORG]] uncivilized , n - neanderthals ..
" the un" ... [[PERSON]] .
[[ORG]] ... nope . [[PERSON]]
the [[ORG]] should be abolished period
the [[ORG]] is a joke .
mr. president ... please tell [[ORG]] . " your message is received . please be aware that your lease is up for renewal and it will not be renewed . please find lodging elsewhere . "
who cares what [[PRODUCT]] ( aka the [[ORG]] ) has to day ? they have no authority over us ... look at who pays the majority of the [[ORG]] bills .. we freakin own the [[ORG]] , we can shut it down if we want to !
[[WORK_OF_ART]] , we 're not dealing with an intruder at home or someone stealing our car , terrorists attempting to harm [[NORP]] is enough reason to strike the snake in the head , no questions asked . you [[NORP]] live just on the left side of things , all the times , trust me i know , i 'm [[NORP]] born and now a [[PERCENT]] proud to be an [[ORG]] , shut up and eat your croissant .
soleimani ’s mere existence violated international human rights laws , s)$&&&@d liberal ! ! !
so kick us out of the [[ORG]]
the [[ORG]] also considers abortion a human right so it has no credibility when it makes declarations about human right violations .
[[ORG]] [[NORP]] human rights ecpert . that says it all . she would prefer allowing this [[GPE]] to continue to kill our soldiers . the [[ORG]] is worthless . of course they loved obama .
key word " french " human rights expert . for sale : [[CARDINAL]] ( [[CARDINAL]] ) [[NORP]] rifle , never fired , only dropped once
the [[ORG]] should protest by leaving [[GPE]] for [[GPE]] and move its center there .
good thing trump is illiterate so he has immunity from executive order [[DATE]] on to assassinating putin
the fact that [[NORP]] was in [[GPE]] during this staged [[NORP]] attack on the [[GPE]] embassy more than enough . not to mention the previous threats he 's made . there 's also several that met in the [[GPE]] [[ORG]] that have turned out to be double - crosser 's that need to be removed because they are a threat . they were even at the [[ORG]] attack !
we were formerly an honorable people who followed the accepted rules of engagement . now , we are copying the terrorist rules of engagement . if we , as a powerful country , see a dangerous state in the world that is a danger to us , it is our duty to [[EVENT]] and fight them into submission . not , to piecemeal assassinate their citizens however evil they are .
[[LOC]] dear , you obviously do not know the law . the potus has every right to strike [[ORG]] your approval . when [[NORP]] lives are murdered , he most certainly can retaliate appropriately to save more [[NORP]] lives . you obviously live in a fairy tale world where you and your family are protected from such violence , but the rest of us aren't! ... get educated and stop tooting your " i 'm so smart " horn . you 're obviously not a real [[NORP]] citizen at heart .... you , my dear , just want to start trouble and want your [[TIME]] of [[ORG]] ' by being a [[NORP]] sheep following the herd .... paleezz … .trump [[DATE]]
long past time that we kicked the [[ORG]] to [[LOC]] and quit giving them [[MONEY]] .
he was a duly - designated " terrorist . " no matter what the [[ORG]] says .
and ? your point is ? how many human rights did this clown violate ? will the [[ORG]] condemn the terror strikes by the [[NORP]] ? how about the strikes by [[GPE]] 's militias throughout the area ? i guess the better questions is a takeaway from [[PERSON]] 's remarks about the pope : just how many divisions does the [[ORG]] have to enforce its will , and just how will they pay for the rapists and child molesters in the ranks of the troops they do command ? go pound sand !
of course the [[ORG]] piled on against [[ORG]] . the [[ORG]] is against [[GPE]] and it 's supporters . check out how many times the [[ORG]] bashes [[GPE]] and ignores human - rights violations all over the world . the [[ORG]] is useless .
typical [[ORG]] response . this same organization had its ' peacekeepers ' stand by and watch the [[NORP]] genocide because it was n't in their mandate to actually keep the peace with force . they are a waste of [[GPE]] taxpayer 's money .
no one cares [[GPE]] got a slap on the wrist from invading [[GPE]]
[[ORG]] , another reason the [[ORG]] facilities in [[GPE]] will be converted into condominiums . get moving out quickly .
if they were actual humans !
our embassy attacked under his leadership and they killed an [[NORP]] . enough said !
yes the [[ORG]] would defend [[PRODUCT]] ...... they are too afraid of the fascist [[ORG]] regime to do anything else ......
the useless [[ORG]] remained silent all throughout the [[DATE]] and ongoing terror campaigns of [[GPE]] .
how about the rights of over [[CARDINAL]] of our military troops ? the [[ORG]] needs disbanded !
the [[ORG]] has been a useless , money pit for [[NORP]] taxpayers for [[DATE]] now ! never have they done anything to protect our interests any where in any country that we have business interests in . president [[PERSON]] should tell them to go frick themselves , and never give them another red cent !
organizing attacks on our embassy violates human rights laws ... [[ORG]] seems to have ignored that fact .
who the heck is [[ORG]] . who cares what she has to say ?
start giving eviction notices to the occupants of that building in [[LOC]] .
" qassem [[NORP]] strike violated international human rights law , [[ORG]] official argues " what [[ORG]] official ? this just another piece of useless " news ? " besides , the [[ORG]] is a feckless , overpaid , privileged bunch of elites .
so sue us . lol . ignorant plebes .
[[ORG]] logic , like so many other aspects of the organization , is flawed .
[[ORG]] = soldiers that rape women from other countries .
i 'd say any [[NORP]] in [[GPE]] is fair game after the active hostilities against our [[ORG]] . agnes can stop being an [[NORP]] goat prostitute .
this woman is clueless . she obviously has no idea about the dynamics at play . she may as well go somewhere and scream at the sky .
seems the [[ORG]] was n’t worried about the [[CARDINAL]] of [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] troops killed by [[PERSON]] ’s ieds and assassins . the [[ORG]] , unfortunately , continues to display its jealousy and disdain for the [[GPE]] .
the [[ORG]] is usless , close it down ...
bwahahahaha ! ! !
what a joke , we were being attacked and he is the one organizing it and on his way to do more , f the u.n . the are right in tthere with the [[NORP]] and the bs
by all means , let 's all take advice on military self - defense from the [[NORP]] .
" [[NORP]] is our leader " had been photographed spray - painted on windows by [[GPE]] - backed militiamen at [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] . signed by his terrorist minions .. stick that in your wine glass [[PRODUCT]] .
the attack on the [[NORP]] embassy violated our rights - did the [[ORG]] have anything to say ?
they are talking about human rights and [[GPE]] in the same sentence ? now that 's funny !
the new [[ORG]] hq needs to be in [[LOC]] somewhere . not the [[GPE]] .
time to exit the [[ORG]] . they are now the face of terrorism and socialism . i do n't think the [[NORP]] will let us kick them out of [[GPE]] - they make too much money off the [[ORG]] to let that happen .
ok , well then we take it back .
can ms. [[GPE]] comment on an [[NORP]] general being in a foreign country who 's country did not authorize hime to be there ?
this is why the [[ORG]] should be disbanded . this man was responsible for [[CARDINAL]] 's of deaths . however he ca n't killed ? drones are here they do n't put soldiers in danger . the [[ORG]] is such a waste of time and money .
" [[NORP]] " and " [[ORG]] " used in the same comment . who is going to lend that any credence ? i think this killing was foolish , but to argue it was a violation of human rights is absurd .
sad really , that former president [[PERSON]] gave the iranian theocracy [[MONEY]] in hard currency that [[GPE]] has used to kill our troops and sown terrorism through out [[LOC]] . [[NORP]] was the leader of a [[NORP]] terrorist organization [[WORK_OF_ART]] ) responsible for [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] soldiers deaths and countless maimed servicemen and women . not surprising at all that the liberal [[NORP]] want power so badly that they would cower to [[GPE]] for " peace in our time " like [[PERSON]] did to appease [[PERSON]] at the start of [[EVENT]] .
but this terrorists of civilian is okay with the useless [[ORG]] ?
[[GPE]] ? like anyone with a brain cares what they think . not sure why people are crying about these actions making it harder to travel to [[LOC]] ... like anyone with any brains would want to go over to that dirty dust pit .
finally a deserved response that will show [[GPE]] they can not continue their proxy terror campaigns around the world without a decisive response . this government hates all [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] that disagree with them .
riddle me this ? why was an [[NORP]] general in [[GPE]] .... not far away from the attacks on the [[NORP]] base and [[ORG]] ? last i checked [[GPE]] was not in a war with [[GPE]]
[[ORG]] ....... ? where were you when the [[NORP]] government shot and kill [[CARDINAL]] of protester on the streets of [[GPE]] months ago ..... definitely that was not a crime against humanity or there were no human rights violations ..... ?
[[ORG]] .
i say kick the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] its usefulness has long past and cost [[GPE]] taxpayers [[MONEY]] each year and we get nothing but criticism and our kindness is perceived as a weakness . just saying
[[NORP]] . get your head out of your agnes .
had to read all the way to the bottom before there it was “ [[NORP]] ” [[ORG]]
the most inquisitional and useless body on the planet is the [[ORG]] .. human rights violation ? and areas of this miserable country , and it 's people , violate ' human rights ' [[DATE]] .
" under customary international law [[GPE]] can take military action if the threatened attack is imminent , no other means would deﬂect it , and the action is proportionate , ” she wrote . " ...... [[LAW]] ? [[GPE]] is a sovereign nation . we do nt operate on [[NORP]] anti [[NORP]] desires of other nations for [[GPE]] to fail . but just for the record if you read other info on the subject you would see the this now dead general was planning another wave of attacks and probably on our [[ORG]] . which by the way under " international law " is [[NORP]] soil even if it is in [[GPE]] and miles away . america was attacked miss calamari
go kick rocks [[ORG]] ...
[[ORG]] = useless negotiations
[[GPE]] had no trouble supporting obama when they took over near by [[GPE]] 's oil fields .
hey [[PERSON]] where were you when obama was droning people . i did not hear you say anything about that .
" ' under customary international law [[GPE]] can take military action if the threatened attack is imminent , no other means would deﬂect it , and the action is proportionate , ' she wrote . " 1- imminent . [[GPE]] and its general had threatened [[GPE]] with such acts of terrorism on countless occasions , and they did n't specify where / when such acts would take place . [[GPE]] does n't have to sit on its hands waiting to be attacked . check . 2- no other means . this is baloney . trump could have sent in a brigade to try to capture the general , which would have resulted in risking their lives . there 's no law that requires [[GPE]] to stand in harm 's way to defend its interests . check . 3- proportionate . the general had threatened the lives of [[NORP]] staff and soldiers , both in the embassy and in the field . the number killed was limited to the general and those in his immediate vicinity , which were likely his staff . check . trump does n't listen to bureaucrats named [[ORG]] . thank you , mr. [[PERSON]] .
[[ORG]] bite me ! ! ! no more money to these dead beats !
" ... an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” leave it to the [[NORP]] to come up with this absurdity . interesting thought [[ORG]] . perhaps we should have waited around for the likes of [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] to just retire off into the sunset ?
how does that [[ORG]] official feel about ieds and rockets launched against civilians ?
the opinions and actions of [[ORG]] have about the same value as a thimble full of pigeon droppings . we should secede from the [[ORG]] and kick its headquarters out of our country .
[[ORG]] is totally useless !
[[NORP]] coward ! i was in [[GPE]] when a [[NORP]] patrol in an armored vehicle hit a car rolling it over onto several civilians on the sidewalk . the [[NORP]] cowards were to afraid to help them so they left them there and waited 30 min . till they got back to their base to report the incident . agnes should be investigating that kind of activity !
why do liberals love terrorists and murderers ?
[[PERSON]]
what about [[NORP]] murdering [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] ? ? ? did that violate any [[ORG]] pc rules ? ? ? ? ?
a [[NORP]] [[ORG]] official ..... figures . the [[NORP]] are wine and cheeze guzzling pusssays
who is [[LOC]] ? does she know who [[PERSON]] ? did she not see our [[ORG]] get attacked ?
the [[ORG]] is a clubhouse for influential [[ORDINAL]] world globalists with connections . they live the high life in [[LOC]] while pretending to solve the world 's pressing problems .
do n’t know what is dumber — this statement or the [[ORG]] climate change hysteria .
the [[ORG]] has become a worthless money pit .
[[ORG]] . [[PERSON]] ..
got some [[NORP]] rifles for sale , never used and only dropped once .
i think it 's time to get out of the [[ORG]] . these people are definitely terrorists oriented . there 's an old saying that i heard ever since i was a kid it 's " all 's fair in [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . i kind of wonder what human rights laws that [[GPE]] has violated ? ? they do it every day and this general is the one behind the embassy issue . we got attacked ! now it was our turn
uno is an expensive organization which does very little good ; most of the money goes to excessive salaries / bonuses and wasteful spending on liberal ideology driven projects . most staff at uno are [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] . the real question is if [[NORP]] taxpayers ' money should be spent on uno at all . we are the biggest donor and [[ORG]] is right to withhold our contributions which does n't do much good for our interests . the man who was killed was no different than [[PERSON]] or baghdadi , the known terrorists , so trump was right to kill him given he was planning attacks on [[NORP]] interests in the region . you ca n't root out state sponsored terrorism by being nice to these rouge states .
move this leftist organization out of the country
never heard the [[ORG]] condemn [[CARDINAL]] ...
let 's see . obama sent them a pallet full of money and [[ORG]] sent them death .
what ? we 've used military drones for surgical strikes for [[DATE]] now . and now the [[ORG]] decides to gripe ? are they sure this [[ORG]] 's real name is n't [[PERSON]] or something ?
too bad . terrorism violates human rights , too , and this guy was a known terrorist .
i did n't hear anything from the [[ORG]] when [[PERSON]] an [[NORP]] teenager with a drone strike in [[GPE]] .
the [[GPE]] is nothing but an anti [[NORP]] spy network ... always was and always will be ! ! ! !
can we just kick the [[ORG]] out of [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] . [[NORP]] proved that he was an imminent threat on a regular basis . does she think that he simply gave up terrorism [[DATE]] ?
i 'm all broken up that [[ORG]] violated " international law " by having this terrorist liquidated ....
the [[ORG]] and the [[NORP]] ? talk about useless ! did you hear about the [[NORP]] - american ? everytime he took a dump he was a little less [[NORP]]
a human rights violation ? how about the [[NORP]] civilians who were killed while protesting ? how about the [[NORP]] that have been killed at the direction of this terrorist trash ? what a joke . the [[ORG]] should be disbanded .
well all i can say is [[ORG]] the [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] shot down our drone in international airspace violating international law . [[GPE]] also attacked our [[GPE]] embassy violating international law . did n't hear the [[ORG]] complain about that . [[ORG]] appears useless .
do n't think so , [[ORG]] , who needs you chumps anyway
news just broke that it was n't [[PERSON]] . it was actually mr. [[PERSON]] from the [[GPE]] commercials .
when will will tell the [[ORG]] they have to move to [[GPE]] ? how many have to die before we protect ourselves ? lie - berals want us to go to the dims and ask permission , then go to the [[ORG]] and ask permission and probably ask [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] for permission . by that time the targets will be well informed of our intentions .
the [[ORG]] does nothing , so their words mean nothing .
the [[ORG]] is such a useless organization , always [[NORP]] , why do we keep propping it up ? give them [[DATE]] to relocate to a [[NORP]] country , where their ideology is better suited .
lol another indicator of the [[ORG]] 's worthlessness and incompetence .
trump takes strong measured response against an obvious enemy as [[GPE]] and schiff mourn [[PERSON]] death . oh , brother !
" outside the context of active hostilities , the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal , ” ..... who is [[PERSON]] ? in case you have nt noticed miss [[NORP]] [[NORP]] military officer was involved in killing [[NORP]] for [[DATE]] . active hostilities have been going on for [[DATE]] . where the hell is [[ORG]] getting these deep thinking " experts " ?
[[ORG]] is a graft ridden joke existing to support [[ORDINAL]] world countries , their leaders , and [[NORP]] propaganda .
it is time for [[ORG]] to be shut down for good . let them move to [[GPE]] and [[NORP]] tax payers will save [[CARDINAL]] 's of [[MONEY]] on this ( we hate [[GPE]] organization ) .
qassemi was the unofficial number [[CARDINAL]] guy in [[GPE]] , after the supreme leader . his assassination was probably a bad call . we 'll have to see . its like taking out the vice president of [[GPE]] . i think long term it will create more problems for the [[GPE]] and citziens visiting [[NORP]] countries ..
bless her heart !
well hate to say it but the former [[GPE]] president used to do this rather regularly to the tune of [[CARDINAL]] said anything . i suspect it was because the former shared the same globalists world view that s all - so once again rhetoric and politics .
hmm i must have missed when they condemned [[GPE]] for instigating the attacks on our embassy or when they pirate ships in international waters . [[ORG]] = joke
i 'm assuming this frog made similar statements when obama used drones in similar actions ...
the [[ORG]] siding against [[GPE]] . how surprising . i 'm guessing they will be blaming [[GPE]] soon .
and attacking an internationally recognized embassy does not ?
hey , [[LOC]] . get stuffed .
it 's ironic that so many of you trust our intelligence now about this , but do n't trust our intelligence about any other thing . i mean it seems like it 's a bit selective . not like we have n't been duped into a war on bad intelligence by an unpopular president before . or had lies told for [[DATE]] in another ( [[NORP]] papers ) so i 'll just go drink my libertarian tea while you go chew on your cud .
what that waste of humanity did all his life violated human rights .
i feel bad they had to identify him by his ring . they never found my buddy 's legs that were blown all over the [[NORP]] desert by [[CARDINAL]] of this monster 's special bombs .
the world has been put on notice this is n't obama the apologizer calling the shots anymore
funny that the [[ORG]] never condemned the general for his human rights violations with the car bombs and ieds he set off .
its " almost " never legal to attack our embassies ! lol .. these people are literally diabolical , up is down down is up , just tell the nut job its a late abortion then she will be fine with it
callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” i guess she does n't agree with someone being arrested , tried in court , and then sentenced to death for the murders they committed in their " past . " i guess she sides with terrorists over [[ORG]] , like [[PERSON]] did . this guy just paid the price for his past murders .
" french" ... [[PERSON]] said ...
un nessasary
yawwwwnnnnn ..... [[ORG]] should evenly apply and back up their policies across the board . not just cherry pick what they will condemn . [[ORG]] is nothing but a [[ORDINAL]] world country club .
anyone care ? nope , did n't think so .
which is why the [[ORG]] is a joke . " give me your money and we 'll tell you what you can and can not do . " a terrorist was eradicated - they should be celebratory .
put a travel ban and import ban on [[GPE]] and their goods and see how fast they change their tune
how can we forget the [[ORG]] and [[GPE]] getting caught stealing from the [[NORP]] people in the food for oil program set up to help civilians eat during [[EVENT]] .
those same words could have come from [[WORK_OF_ART]] , which is truly unfortunate .
because [[GPE]] is so very good at self - defense ...
the [[ORG]] is just a club for the elite to live extravagant lives and travel the world in luxury at the expense of [[GPE]] taxpayers .
there 's a certain male centric hand gesture that would make a most appropriate official [[ORG]] .gif
while tapping away , do u think she put down her wine glass long enough to think about the lives saved . the general was orchestrating attacks to kill [[CARDINAL]] with the promise of martyrdom.we just helped him lead the charge in the next life .
callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” by her thinking we should have never killed [[PERSON]] .
time to kick the [[ORG]] out of [[GPE]] ! maybe they can set up a new office in [[GPE]] . what a waste of [[ORG]] !
just like [[ORG]] in ww2 , they are ready to bow down . why are the [[NORP]] such cowards ?
get the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] !
the [[ORG]] is nothing more than an echo chamber for condemning the [[GPE]] and attacking our interest . it 's time to defund the [[ORG]] and kick them out of our country .
[[ORG]] ..... what a joke for an organization ..... why is that still in [[GPE]] ....
if you ca n't do anything else , work for the [[ORG]] .
the [[ORG]] as a whole is an enemy of the [[GPE]] .... and should be treated as such ....
nobody cares what the [[ORG]] thinks about anything . they are corrupt , impotent babbling wastes of time and money .
why are we still in the [[ORG]] ? a bunch of deadbeats who wo n't pay their fair share to participate . they criticize our every move . we should just get out and kick them out of our country . no more free rides .
they attacked our embassy . how is that not a hostile action ?
the [[ORG]] is not necessary for [[GPE]] to thrive .
i am not a member or citizen of [[ORG]] . i could not care less what they say or think . [[ORG]] should get out of [[GPE]] !
time to move the un headquarters out of the safe and cushy [[GPE]] and put it in one of the terrorist countries they are so fond of protecting . let 's see how they " walk the talk " then .
remember patriots it was the [[ORG]] who put [[GPE]] like [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] in charge of " [[WORK_OF_ART]] ... yea , they 're that worthless ! we should have pulled out [[DATE]] and take a simply [[ORG]] ... " any nation that kills [[NORP]] of attacks our interests ceases to exist " . after a few 3rd [[ORG]] disappear the rest will get the hint !
well thankfully it was n’t outside the context of active hostilities . also . who cares what the [[ORG]] says ?
the [[ORG]] is adamantly anti [[NORP]] . we need to stop funding our enemies .
notice the absent support of our so called allies . they do n't have our back but we are expected to have theirs
based on this guy 's [[PRODUCT]] picture , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " needs to lay off testosterone shots
" callamard noted that ' an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ' " aaaaand that 's just another reason why the [[ORG]] has become irrelevant . [[PERSON]] 'em off of [[NORP]] soil and withdraw .
the [[ORG]] itself is a den of terrorists . they should leave .
and ... still waiting for similar condemnation on the rocket attack against the [[GPE]] base in [[GPE]] ... i 'm assuming it will be coming any minute now ...
the useless nations speaks up on this as if their noise could change anything . what did they have to say about [[PERSON]] or any of the other terrorist murders carried out in [[DATE]] ?
sanction us with your army , oh , you do n’t have an army . pound sand [[ORG]] .
further evidence that liberals have a mental disorder .
no human rights for those that do n't offer them to others !
[[LOC]] is the type of global elitist that [[GPE]] wanted the [[GPE]] to be subservient to .
so we violated human rights that makes the score 1 for [[GPE]] to [[CARDINAL]] for the [[NORP]] .
the [[NORP]] have been wrong about military intelligence since [[ORG]] ill - fated attack on [[GPE]] in [[DATE]] . did the [[ORG]] have anything to say about [[NORP]] aggression ? as if [[GPE]] would listen anyway .
did the [[ORG]] condemn [[PERSON]] involvement in the embassy attack ? who cares what the [[ORG]] thinks . tell them to pound sand , they will never get anything past us in the security counsel .
so , storming an embassy is n't an imminent threat ?
well , the [[ORG]] has a couple of options . they could file suit ... or attack us . i think they should attack .
did she miss the part where [[NORP]] backed protesters attempted to raid our embassy ? did the [[ORG]] shame [[GPE]] ? did the [[ORG]] do anything to protect our assets in [[GPE]] ?
the [[ORG]] is controlled by [[NORP]] / globalists . evict the [[ORG]]
[[PERSON]] probably thought the same thing when [[PERSON]] dropped the bombs on his house and killed his son . he shrunk back into his hole and did n't crawl out for [[DATE]] . by then others wanted his head , and now he 's dead . [[GPE]] has been flaunting international law for [[DATE]] . obama sold us out in his vain quest to arm [[LOC]] against the [[GPE]] . trump is just resetting the board and letting the [[PERSON]] know his lackeys are no longer in charge here , and his aggressive interest in [[GPE]] will not go unmatched .
the [[ORG]] is a worthless money pit .
the [[ORG]] ? lmao .
an anti - semitic org . does n't like that a terrorist who lives to wipe out israel was eliminated .
now i 'm confused ... when this hag came out against the strike , i thought it was a good action on the part of the president , but now i just read that [[PERSON]] thought it was a good idea and i 'm starting to [[ORDINAL]] guess my [[ORDINAL]] instincts .
maybe the [[NORP]] demonstrators in [[GPE]] should head for the [[NORP]] embassy next . might be some people to kill there instead of [[GPE]] soldiers ready to defend their own otherwise empty embassy . she 'd probably say that dying at the hands of the terrorists would be a violation of [[ORG]] laws , however . what a twit to criticize going after the top terror general of the top terror country , who was in another country to plan and orchestrate his next murders .
[[ORG]] is a high end country club for [[ORDINAL]] world delegates intent on destroying the way of life in the western world .
for sale : [[CARDINAL]] used [[NORP]] army issue rifle . excellent condition , never fired and only dropped once .
it makes sense that a [[NORP]] dignitary would be upset about the strike since [[PERCENT]] of the the illegal trade with [[GPE]] comes from [[GPE]] as does most of their navy and missile systems . with out [[GPE]] propping [[GPE]] up their economy would have collapsed [[DATE]]
agnes , had people like you been in charge of military decisions in [[EVENT]] , there would be no [[ORG]] , and everyone would have been speaking [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] . i would give anything if we could transport general [[PERSON]] to [[DATE]] and hear his response to your blather .
guaranteed intelligence has found future attack plans with his prints.game over .
too bad ... so sad
throw them out of the country
abolish u.n. ! only talk & no action , [[ORG]] and waste of [[GPE]] taxpayers ' money .
cheese eatin ' surrendermonkey !
who give a big shiz ' what the [[ORG]] thinks . their a do n't nothing bunch of communist , [[NORP]] wanting to dictate [[GPE]] policies . [[ORG]] diplomatst or getting rich with our money . stop feeding fascists . we need to get out of the [[ORG]] and move them to [[LOC]] . [[PERSON]] them out of the [[GPE]] .
factually incorrect she is not a [[ORG]] official
agnes obviously feels pretty smug inside those warm walls of the [[ORG]] . give her plenty of time to pontificate .
oh well 🤷 ‍ ♂ ️
what s " the [[ORG]] " ?
this guy was a merchant of death , and i do n't recall the [[ORG]] complaining about the victims of his trade craft . good riddance .
vintage wwi and [[EVENT]] [[NORP]] rifles for sale : in very good condition . never been fired . but , full disclosure , minor scuffs due to being dropped [[CARDINAL]] times .
the [[ORG]] exists to exploit [[GPE]]
the [[ORG]] has become a vestigial remnant of a useless and expensive organization that is becoming more and more irrelevant with each passing day . this [[NORP]] " rapporteur " is out of her mind . a killer of [[NORP]] and our allies , a terrorist of the worst stripe got what he deserved .
[[ORG]] who ?
the [[ORG]] has to pretend to be upset . you know they are all sitting in their offices hoping the [[GPE]] levels the entire [[LOC]] .
she needs to understand the difference between apologizing for your country 's existence and standing up for your country . then again , spewing hatred for the people who pay the bills shows how little she understands anything .
ah the [[NORP]] , only country in the world with battle tanks that have reverse lights .
pizz on the [[ORG]] and everything evil they stand for .......
let me splain it for you [[LOC]] , : " you poke the bear , you get the claws " .
trump to [[GPE]] : " sorry about killing that brutal [[NORP]] general at your airport . " [[GPE]] to trump : " it 's cool . "
hummm , just tracked the well know leader of [[ORG]] from an embassy attack , headed to the airport after the attack . unfortunately got into the way of high tech post hole drilling project at airport ... dang just bad luck .
i 'm going to allow it
in [[DATE]] the [[ORG]] restricted [[PERSON]] from travel outside [[GPE]] . he was taken out while overseeing actions against the [[GPE]] while he was ... outside [[GPE]] . what say you [[ORG]] bureaucrat ?
the strike against a known terrorist violated human rights ? the [[ORG]] is becoming a joke . i once respected the [[ORG]] but the more i learn about this organization , the more i realize it 's a joke .
liberals everywhere grieving over the loss of this fine fellow !
the [[ORG]] does not respect my rights . i do n't respect the [[ORG]] .
middleast terror countries do n't understand conciliatory . they view it as weakness
someone call the waaaahmbulance .
the [[ORG]] is almost useless .
this coming from someone who is from the biggest chicken shif country in the world
the only way to peace in [[LOC]] is to get rid of certain regimes and take over the countries ! you want to talk about human rights ! look at what those countries are doing to their own people . they have no interest in helping their own people . those in power over there do not care about their people or the people around them . they spew hatred ....
it violated [[ORG]] international law ? oops ! ( shrugging ) sarry ! !
so says this idiotic [[NORP]] woman . who put here in charge of morality ? oh , that 's right ... she is n't .
i wonder why [[NORP]] are n't dancing on the streets to celebrate the death of this monster .
sounds like we may get a dictatorship after all comrades ! ! !
[[NORP]] countries negociate free passage for terrorists through their airports in exchange for some peace . this kind of cowardly appeasement will never be acceptable in [[GPE]] . this [[ORG]] person ( never heard of her / him before ) speaks from a corrupt perspective that advocates for dealing directly with terrorists in exchange for some peace . this is the kind of policy that would have worked under obama but will never be accepted by [[ORG]] .
i will add this to my book of reasons the [[ORG]] is useless
making [[GPE]] great , putting [[GPE]] [[ORDINAL]] , is what [[ORG]] has done and is doing . this is what that looks like and it 's just fine , we 're a sovereign nation that does what 's needed to protect our citizens , no [[ORG]] approval necessary . thank you president [[PERSON]] .
dear [[ORG]] , your office space lease has expired . please depart the country immediately . seek shelter where human rights do nt exist . signed [[ORG]] .
who cares what any [[ORG]] official has to say about anything ? [[GPE]] should cut all ties , official and financial , to the [[ORG]] , tell the diplomats to leave the [[GPE]] and reclaim the property as housing for the homeless .
finally we are standing up to these terrorist and starting to give it back to them . this nut is another one like many in the [[GPE]] who would rather see [[NORP]] killed and slaughtered then anybody else .
the [[ORG]] is all but done for and they can squawk all they care to about human rights but did n't say a word when [[NORP]] were just killed in rocket attacks . that loss did n't seem to twitch the [[ORG]] and their human rights claim at all . message to the u.n.- get in front and lead , get behind and follow or get the heii out of the way . you 'd better find your place in a hurry because if you 're going to side with terrorism , then you 're terrorists .
[[ORG]] " stop taking out terrorists ! "
so by the [[ORG]] standards its ok for [[GPE]] to shoot at us bomb us and otherwise wage a war but the moment we defend ourselves its a global atrocity ? ? ? ? sorry not sorry !
[[ORG]] cowards as usual . appease the enemy . hide . cowards . [[ORG]]
it 's all fun and games until you are the one being hunted
make the [[ORG]] member states pay their back parking fines in [[LOC]] then evict the bums . this will be of great benefit to [[LOC]] ... extra revenue and the smell might get a little better .
and this coming from the organization that rapes women and children in exchange for food relief . it 's past time to get out of that corrupted anti - america organization and then get them the hell off our soil .
lol , the only people we might owe an apology to are the [[NORP]] ... and i have yet to meet an [[NORP]] who gets upset about a dead [[NORP]] general !
the [[ORG]] is so afraid of [[GPE]] it is stupid . the [[ORG]] should be moved out of the [[GPE]] and let them set up in [[GPE]] and see how long that last . stop paying the stealing [[ORG]] people . i am fed up with supporting a group that attacks us all the time with my tax dollars .
says somebody who has never been in a war zone .....
" the [[NORP]] human rights expert " enough said .... she has no credibility .
is n't the [[ORG]] just hilarious . more and more useless everyday .
why are we still in the [[ORG]] , a known [[NORP]] organization except when they want money
tell that to my buddy with the metal legs . his earlier legs were blown off by [[CARDINAL]] of this focker 's bombs
so attacking [[ORG]] was n’t ?
what about the deeds [[NORP]] planned and executed ? were any of those in violation of international laws ?
dear , [[ORG]] ... go pound sand . sincerely , [[GPE]] .
really now the [[ORG]] comes out of the closet to whine about human rights . they 're getting to be alot like [[ORG]] crying racism [[DATE]] . nobody listens to them anymore
of course she 's [[NORP]] , all they do is throw down their guns and run away .
[[ORG]] is [[ORG]] . [[DATE]] .
the [[ORG]] better just get out of the way . that are envious of the [[GPE]] and hate up !
terrorists supporting terrorists . who would have guessed . get the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] , and get the [[GPE]] out of the [[ORG]] .
this from one of the most anti - us organizations on the face of the planet . can we leave them already ? ?
get the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] ... like [[DATE]] ! !
it was an accident . we were cleaning our missile launchers and they went off . sorry about that .
anges callamard can go speak directly to the families of the [[NORP]] service men and women that were killed as a result of this [[NORP]] terrorist ’s actions then return to her [[NORP]] home to eat crepes and sip an aperitif in front of a warm fire .
[[ORG]] forces are well documented as violating the human rights of every country they inhabit . that makes this comment rather hypocritical and expected
the [[ORG]] basically called [[GPE]] a terrorist 's state i guess we are next ! lol [[GPE]] has been bowing to these people for [[DATE]] . they took in refugees and in [[DATE]] the tried to burndown [[GPE]] demanding jobs and money . the ink was not even dry on the entery applications and you take up for them ? ? ? ?
this “ [[NORP]] human rights expert ” ( what a joke ) is irrelevant . she will not dictate how the [[GPE]] conducts protecting [[NORP]] ! ! !
of course they ignore the several attacks made against [[GPE]] assets and citizens .
good thing he was n't classified as human . all legal .
" human rights " un - style are a greater danger to the [[GPE]] than nukes .
[[ORG]] sucks , time to get out . it supports [[GPE]] 's enemies . [[NORP]] was a clear and present danger to [[NORP]] in [[GPE]] . and the people of [[GPE]] . [[ORG]] is useless full of [[GPE]] 's enemies .
the [[ORG]] is a worthless hunk of junk and should be disbanded and the earth salted where it stood . but ... we are better than to hide in the sky and assassinate our enemies from cover . and , we also risk actions that are legitimate acts of war . those are the acts of terrorists .
the very last thing the [[ORG]] is worried about is human rights . they need to just go shut up and color .
[[GPE]] needs to get out of the [[ORG]] , the [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] bank and start depending on [[GPE]] .
ah go to hell . has there been one word - one!-out of the [[ORG]] in condemnation of the murderous [[NORP]] mullahs killing [[NORP]] troops and citizens via their proxies throughout [[LOC]] ?
who cares what this liberal extremist has to say [[GPE]] has a right and a duty to defend its own , at home , and abroad . she , and the [[ORG]] are worthless
trump just let the world of terrorists know . do n't f ... with us .
[[ORG]] is an organization that has vastly outlived its relevance . we need to defund them and have them move their headquarters to some socialist paradise . perhaps [[GPE]] ?
agnes would rather we just sent piles of cash ....
too bad [[PERSON]] is an unknown and will be forgotten [[DATE]]
please tell me that means we can also bring in obama as well . where were you then ? yea ... put a sock in it [[LOC]] , before we decide to stop funding the useless [[ORG]] .
well the [[GPE]] can easily pull out of the [[ORG]] < who has been using [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] , > .. we do n't need them but they need the [[GPE]] .
forget the international human rights - how about the thousands of international human lives this man caused the deaths of . [[PERSON]] to president [[PERSON]]
agnes ... when you and the rest of the [[ORG]] , yes , the rest of the [[ORG]] take action against the rockets fired , the [[ORG]] 's planted , the soldiers killed and maimed , the citizens killed and maimed .... by [[NORP]] trained , [[NORP]] backed proxies ... then you have room to run your mouth . do you want to know why the [[ORG]] is so ineffective ? it is because the very council that handles security decisions has [[CARDINAL]] permanent veto wielding members in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . anything and everything that is suggested by the [[GPE]] is vetoed . sanctions are ignored , allowing money to flow into the coffers to empower and maintain regimes which would be more apt to come to the negotiation table if the flow stopped . before you point your finger at [[GPE]] , make sure your paperwork is in order .
[[GPE]] would need to prove the person targeted constituted an imminent threat to others . seriously ? [[NORP]] must be running the [[ORG]] .
“ almost ... never ... likely ... ” spinning .... and spinning like a dem
look at agnes " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " twitter homepage . " accept refugees " in bold letters . please revoke her visa and let her go live with these " religion of peace " followers . while we are at it , just revoke everyone 's visa at the worthless [[ORG]] , and demo the building . tell them we no longer will accept mandates and edicts from such an [[NORP]] hating organization .
[[ORG]] who ?
i thought [[ORG]] pulled out of the [[ORG]] ? ? ,
[[GPE]] should dump the [[ORG]] and invite them to move to [[GPE]] . we should not belong . the [[ORG]] is a total lost , corrupt and unneeded albatros , certainly we do not need to be a part of this mess .
time to evict the the [[ORG]] out of the country .
[[GPE]] ... as if anyone cared about their opinion
[[PERSON]] is next on the list
finger slipped on the trigger , so sorry .
she can shove it up her ...
get the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] and get the [[GPE]] out of the [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] doing what other presidents should have done [[DATE]] ... on everything ! gettin it done ... [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
[[GPE]] .
uh - oh ! if the [[ORG]] thinks [[ORG]] might have broken the law they might send him a sternly worded letter letting the world know how unhappy they are ! of course , that letter will be on paper we paid for ...
the [[ORG]] says it 's illegal . so , we were probably in the right , given that the [[ORG]] is now packed with people who hate [[GPE]] and the [[GPE]] .
yeah . you 're right , he was a good guy , we'll send flowers .
the [[ORG]] should be tossed out of america- just a bunch of crybabies that do n’t pay their fair share- this organizations been a joke for [[DATE]] , and real [[NORP]] are tired of paying for it
somebody has to get [[PERSON]] up here . the [[GPE]] really does not care what you or the [[ORG]] thinks .
time to convert the [[ORG]] building in prime ny real estate to a residential building [[CARDINAL]] yr lease that building and the money we give [[ORG]] alone so they can go ahead and obstruct us runs in [[MONEY]]
the progressive [[ORG]] 's mental illness is worldwide .
imagine that , the [[NORP]] body is n't cold yet and the [[ORG]] is crying [[NORP]] calls it reckless [[PERSON]] says we threw a stick of dynamite into a tender box cupcake - nothing heard , he 's sucking his thumb under the covers [[ORG]] 2020
and how legal was it for [[GPE]] to take our people hostage ? how legal is it for [[GPE]] to supply weapons to [[ORG]] ? how legal is it for [[GPE]] to sponsor world wide terrorism ?
he ordered a drone strike on a sovereign nation . can [[GPE]] order a drone strike in [[GPE]] to eliminate [[NORP]] officials ? just asking .
we know ... the [[NORP]] would have surrendered long ago . cowards and mentally inept
but when the [[NORP]] fire rockets to kill [[NORP]] it is not a violation of international human rights . time for the [[GPE]] to cut the funds off to the [[ORG]] . it is controlled by [[GPE]] 's enemies .
get [[GPE]] out of the [[ORG]] . !
it 's ok , he was n't human .
immediately : time for the [[GPE]] to stop giving money to the [[ORG]] . after that , begin charging them and all their diplomats the highest rent levels possible including all the diplomat residence rents around the [[ORG]] . if they ca n't pay , evict them - let them go to the [[ORG]] where they 'll continue to destroy [[LOC]] ....
so says a frenchman ... the only country that requires every soldier to pack a white flag .
trump had good reason , get the [[ORG]] out of [[GPE]] . they have no business dictating how we respond to anything .
" qassem [[NORP]] strike violated international human rights law , [[ORG]] official argues " . i see . and where was this statement when ambassador [[PERSON]] 's dead body was being drug through the streets of [[GPE]] ? the [[ORG]] was silent so silent you could hear crickets . [[ORG]] in [[DATE]] and put an end to this charade .
liberals are hypocrites . get the [[ORG]] out of [[GPE]] and cut off all funding .
and according to the communist anti - freedom organization , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] are not guilty of human rights violations .
i wonder if [[NORP]] ever violated human rights laws ? enough said
interesting the [[ORG]] kept their mouth shut while obama drone striked people for [[DATE]]
almost never likely to be legal is a pretty broad statement to make
what would the [[ORG]] do without [[GPE]] money , personnel , and materials ?
oops . our bad . so sorry .
can we now throw the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] . we pay way too much for this worthless body of [[GPE]] haters .
the [[NORP]] human rights expert also criticized the [[ORG]] ’s statement about the airstrike . well that about sums it up
[[NORP]] was told not to leave [[GPE]] to cause problems elsewhere in the world , he did so anyway and now the problem is solved . someone like [[NORP]] , truly does not have " rights " when they go about killing and creating terror .
[[ORG]] out of [[GPE]] . now .
[[GPE]] out of the [[ORG]] [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]]
[[PERSON]] and [[GPE]] will be be leading the eulogy for the [[NORP]] later today .
president [[PERSON]] is not obliged to prove anything . least of all to you [[PRODUCT]] .
cut all funding from [[ORG]] now .
the [[ORG]] did n't condemn the [[NORP]] backed attack that killed the [[GPE]] contractor , nor did it condemn the attacks against [[GPE]] by [[ORG]] . the [[ORG]] is of no use to the [[GPE]] . we should withdraw from the [[ORG]] and kick them out of our country .
ok .. ya'all are right ... go ahead and move the [[ORG]] building to [[GPE]] or [[CARDINAL]] of the other liberal whining countries asap
little [[ORG]] is butthurtt ? awwwww come here have another missile .. better ?
this is what we always expect from the [[ORG]] . we need to throw them out of this country and let some other country support them . they are always our enemy and always side against us . close down that building and stop supporting them in any fashion . they are a worthless organization who has continued past their time to be necessary .
international human rights law . okay . got it . funny how the [[ORG]] did not say a damned thing about the murder of [[PERSON]] in [[GPE]] . all you heard then were crickets chirping . well [[ORG]] , you can take your [[CARDINAL]] armored tank divisions and send them to [[LOC]] to aid the beleaguered [[ORG]] forces whose famous mission is to spread love and peace throughout the world and to aid the poor and oppressed . not ! ! ! !
the [[ORG]] violates international human rights laws
take note of who cries foul when at terrorist is killed .
[[PERSON]] and his attack against [[NORP]] 's and [[NORP]] violated human rights laws . now he is gone
bs [[PERSON]] was banned from international travel under un security counsel resolution 2231 and should never have been let into [[GPE]] in the [[ORDINAL]] place . he chose to leave [[GPE]] and his blood is on his own head .
so the denouncements have started coming in from the [[ORG]] , world leaders . - an irresponsible and illegal crime . trump has shamed [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .
can we please close the [[ORG]] , like right now . what a colossal waste of my tax money .
take [[GPE]] out of the [[ORG]] . now .
what 's this [[ORG]] thing ? is it real ?
screw the in , they are usless
can we see her statements on [[GPE]] sponsoring terrorism ?
really ? and what international human rights law was violated [[DATE]] when [[GPE]] killed and wounded [[NORP]] and then attacked our embassy in another country ?
i look forward to dictating peace to [[GPE]] in [[FAC]] at [[GPE]] . [[PERSON]]
tough
i wonder what her opinion is about attacking a us embassy . i suppose that it is perfectly acceptable under [[ORG]] and international law - not . where is the condemnation of [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] for allowing the embassy to be attacked .
time to get rid of the [[ORG]] .
best way to keep a military operation secret - exclude the [[ORG]] of representatives ...
she is [[NORP]] . their idea of defending one 's self is to lay down arms and just let the enemy invade your country . has worked real well for them in the past . they do make good cheese , i will give them that .
> > > agnes callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his > > > targeting for killing lawful . ” go back to your vichy government , agnes
nothing but nosense from the [[ORG]] . is n't it time we take back the [[ORG]] 's original intent . stop funding " their " type of terror !
the [[ORG]] has a special rapporteur on [[PERSON]] ? this is what you 're spending our [[GPE]] tax dollars on ?
when do we get to kick the [[ORG]] out of [[LOC]] and resign our membership .
the [[ORG]] , what a joke . hey [[PRODUCT]] , now that 's a name that would strike fear in the enemy . that 's all obama 's regime would do , is deliberate , while [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] , including our ambassador , were killed in an attack on our consulate . time for deliberation and negotiation with these [[PERSON]] fanatics is over . [[ORG]] are you women going to realize that radical [[ORG]] does not provide human rights to your gender ?
an enemy of [[GPE]] was killed by [[GPE]] . the rest of the world ought to take heed .
far past time to kick the [[ORG]] out of the [[GPE]] .
let 's see now ....... terrorist suicide bombs ...... innocent civilians ..... legal drone strikes on know terrorist responsible for [[CARDINAL]] of deaths ..... illegal [[GPE]] .....
cry me a river [[LOC]] ... go away .
obama and the squad break out the prayer rugs
[[ORG]] freaking hoo .
the [[GPE]] does not look to [[ORG]] for protection . splash [[CARDINAL]] !
would you care for some fromage with your whine , [[LOC]] ?
please bomb the [[ORG]] next . what a completely worthless organization .
" callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful . ” what a load of bs^ .... how dare you kill the [[PERSON]]
so do car - bombs , but you do n't see the terrorist honoring any of the peace accords ...
time to drone the [[ORG]] council
agnes will stand by watching as her country is over run my [[NORP]] . if they do n't fight back they wo n't win . precision targeting is what [[GPE]] is known for . that 's what they will get . sorry you do n't like our drones , maybe you do n't need our money or our protection .
but nations are n't allowed to seal their own borders to keep these dunies out , right [[ORG]] ?
looks like they 'll be finding soleimani 's dna all over [[FAC]] should go aver and get some
killing of terrorists is now against international law ? is the [[ORG]] on some kind of drugs ? how many idiots does is take to form a [[ORG]] committee ?
the [[NORP]] human rights expert ? ? ? how many hits like this has the french foreign legion carried out in [[DATE]] on the continent of [[LOC]] ? if this is the standard then you need to clean up your house and reel in your [[ORG]] , i mean the [[ORG]] .
the [[GPE]] strikes [[LOC]] . [[LOC]] strikes the [[GPE]] . the [[GPE]] strikes [[LOC]] . and the vicious cycle continues . meanwhile , as the world 's # [[MONEY]] weapons manufacturer , the [[GPE]] continues to profit from war .
the [[ORG]] keeps forgetting that without the [[GPE]] participation and military strength , it would be nonexistent .
what a clown .
we used a drone to kill him , would he more dead if we used a [[ORG]] fighter jet ?
“ callamard noted that “ an individual ’s past involvement in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawfully ” wow they sound just like [[NORP]] ! ! no shock there
[[ORG]] needs to worry about all the illegitimate children it 's soldiers are producing and abandoning .
the [[ORG]] is a [[PERSON]] ! ! ! ! .... the [[GPE]] pouring money into a organization that do n't do s^^t ! ! !
so , let 's see . all the attacks , terrorism and murders perpetrated on the world by the [[NORP]] is just fine . any retaliatory strike in response to these pigs , especially with president [[PERSON]] giving the order , is a violation of human rights . really ? bullfeathers ! time for this group of impotent , corrupt , money wasting dodos to leave our soil and go screw up someone elses city and time for us to thumb our nose to them . seems only when [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] defends it 's an act against humanity . when the terrorists or a violent group or nation acts in aggression . it 's perfectly fine .
the [[ORG]] is talking about human rights is the equivalence of a millennial using their [[ORG]] texting the horrors of capitalism .
quote : " the targeted killings of [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] are most lokely unlawful and violate international human rights law " lokely unlawful ? is that some fancy [[NORP]] legal term ?
so , even if they are a terrorist , if you do n't catch them in the act or if they 're not attacking you at the moment , they get away with it scot free ? also , what was he doing in [[GPE]] ? hello !
[[NORP]] ...... hacking off heads of innocents murdering [[NORP]] ... massive destructive bombs that have killed [[CARDINAL]] ... and the [[ORG]] complains this strike was against human rights ........ if [[GPE]] gets the bomb they will use it ... to be certain ....... millions will die ... to the [[ORG]] that would be ok .... because the wacky [[NORP]] leadership is just harassed and misunderstood ........
mr. [[PERSON]] get us out of the [[ORG]] . a worthless group that agrees with the [[GPE]] [[PERCENT]] of the time and we pay for them to be in [[GPE]] . over .
the attack on our embassy was an attack of our sovereignty ; an act of war . so be it . we strike back at the [[NORP]] aggressors .
maybe she should ask herself . what is the top general of [[GPE]] doing in [[GPE]] ?
who ?
when obama did drone strikes nobody said anything
the [[ORG]] . the most useless group of buerocrats ever put together .
and we are really concerned what a [[NORP]] activist has to say ?
the [[ORG]] is a joke .
[[ORG]] hahaha .
take [[CARDINAL]] look at the member countries on the [[ORG]] human rights council and you 'll quickly realize they 're not about human rights
what about the [[ORG]] resolution saying the general should never travel outside of [[GPE]] ?
trump is often criticized for hitting back at anyone that attacks him . what dems do n't get is that that attitude is [[ORG]] what made [[GPE]] strong , other nation 's knowledge that if you attack us , we will drop the hammer on you , not send pallets of cash .
have n't heard anything from her or the [[ORG]] on the constant attacks on [[GPE]] , the [[GPE]] backed terrorist attack on [[NORP]] oil refinery , the [[NORP]] government treatment of their own people nor the many other things [[GPE]] is doing . is she a [[NORP]] sympathizer ?
" the [[ORG]] special rapporteur on extrajudicial killing on [[DATE]] said the president [[PERSON]] - approved drone strike against [[PERSON]] , [[GPE]] ’s top general , violated international human rights law . " the general was a terrorist and in charge of [[ORG]] , which he and his force have been so designated by many nations . he is responsible for the deaths and injuries of [[CARDINAL]] of people all over the world , not just [[NORP]] . the [[GPE]] is actively in war with [[ORG]] and has authorized military force for this war . we should stop funding the [[ORG]] and kick them out of [[LOC]] . did you say one word like this when president [[PERSON]] droned all those terrorist , i do n't think so . you and your un elitist can pound sand .
this [[NORP]] woman said , “ outside the context of active hostilities , the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal , ” .. targeted drone strikes is exactly how to deal with these rogue regimes ! why send our servicemen to these areas or kill a bunch of their soldiers when it ’s their leadership who needs to be eliminated ? times have changed and tactics need to change as well . great job mr president 🇺 [[PERSON]]
i never hear these rep[representatives condemn the killing of jews by [[GPE]] 's proxies . they have no credibility .
[[NORP]] was a soldier in a war and was killed . that 's all it was .
blah , blah , blah , [[GPE]] is evil . blah , blah , blah , [[GPE]] did something illegal . typical pablum from a [[ORG]] bureaucrat . remind me what this bureaucrat said when [[NORP]] annexed the [[ORG]] . let me guess . nothing .
leave it to the [[ORG]] to protect a terrorist . someone should ask her what he was doing in [[GPE]] considering the [[ORG]] had a travel ban against him .
is this the air strike the [[GPE]] stormed the embassy for ?
so , i guess the murder of innocents , [[NORP]] in particular , is not a violation of human rights ? ? ?
i believe human rights laws go too far . i also believe [[ORG]] countries and their mouth must be subjected to attack from drones as well . it makes the whole war process work more smoothly .
the [[ORG]] is not a place where i would want any [[NORP]] involved with . those people are not friendly to [[GPE]] .
agnes : this was illegal . trump : pulling [[ORG]] funding . [[ORG]] : shut up , agnes - hole .
get out of the [[ORG]] , nothing but unintelligent liberals who are corrupt .
you can purchase [[ORG]] rifles throughout the world . never been fired , only dropped once .
[[GPE]] needs a good spanking ... they need to understand that their actions have consequences ....
could n't possibly care any less what anyone at the [[ORG]] has to say about anything at all . funny how these folks had no issue with obama 's endless drone strikes or for that matter , his " signature strikes " where we did n't even know who it was that we were striking and they were based entirely on watching people via satellite then hoping they turned out to be the bad guys after we hit them , at least in the rare instance where we actually went back to check afterwards . in fact , obama stopped using the air force for drone strikes entirely and opted for using the [[ORG]] instead so that they could be kept secret from everyone , including [[ORG]] . this was a very measured , very strong response . the only other options were to either hit targets that are actually on [[NORP]] soil which would be too strong or to just hit more , random [[NORP]] backed militias which would be too weak . [[NORP]] was a nice piece to take off the board and we did n't have to go into [[GPE]] to do it , that 's about as good of a response as we could 've hoped for and it was done immediately so it ca n't be mistaken for anything other than retaliation , also a good thing .
tough .
well [[PRODUCT]] , let me say this ..... oh well ! ! next ! ! !
the [[ORG]] and its representatives can drop dead .
the [[ORG]] is a joke and coming from a [[NORP]] woman that probably knows very little about what sacrifices other countries made for her to allow her to continue to be [[NORP]] ...
i guess the [[ORG]] never heard of self - defense .
expel the [[ORG]] and rent the place out for the homeless .
we need to pull out of the [[ORG]] . when [[CARDINAL]] of [[ORG]] " is known human rights violators , the [[ORG]] has failed the world . the [[ORG]] is hypocritical to say anyone violated international human rights law in its current form .
put this terrorist sympathizer on the list .
uhhhh ... now you say something ?
[[GPE]] . i guess that never came up when obummer was pres .
" .... adding that the [[GPE]] would need to prove the person targeted constituted an imminent threat to others . " are you serious [[LOC]] ? this man was , for [[DATE]] , [[CARDINAL]] of the most efficient terrorists the world has ever known . [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] looked up to this man as a role model . they announced that multiple times . imminent threat to others ? ! ? ! ? he was an imminent threat to [[CARDINAL]] of " others . "
scroo the [[ORG]] .
please close the [[ORG]] on 1st ave and relocate to another country
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] . my guess is most feet - on - the - ground [[NORP]] are just really tired of things like the attack on our embassy in [[GPE]] going unanswered . [[PERSON]] !
when we want the [[ORG]] 's opinion we 'll give it to them .
the [[ORG]] is a total joke .
who cares what the [[ORG]] " special rapporteur on extrajudicial killing " has to say . no one pays attention to [[ORG]] orders or comments anymore .
we do n't care what you think [[ORG]] .
i hope all the [[GPE]] - based militia - men are seeing how easy it was for us to take out a general in [[LOC]] .
now that [[GPE]] have weighed in i can go about my day .
[[ORG]] has shown its colors before .
stop funding the [[ORG]] . [[PERSON]] them out of the [[GPE]]
who cares ? [[NORP]] violated the [[ORG]] 2015 travel ban by being in [[GPE]] and paid the price for that mistake !
was n’t salmonella ordered to never leave [[GPE]] by the all mighty [[ORG]] ?
terrorists operate outside the law so taking care of them outside the law is perfectly fine . it ’s time to put some symmetry in this asymmetric war against terrorism .
the [[ORG]] has nothing worthwhile to say about anything and no power over anyone , much less the [[GPE]] .
the [[ORG]] is a useless entity and should be removed from [[GPE]] soil .
he was a soldier - get over it - no one seems to care when our citizens are killed .
yeah ok we wo n't do it again . :)
the [[ORG]] has no credibility . [[DATE]] has exposed their corruption in their attempt to establish a new world order .
dear mr. president , please tell the [[ORG]] we quit and get out of [[GPE]] . i do n't care where , just go ... perhaps a beautiful new [[ORG]] on that real estate ?
[[GPE]] has never been a real friend of the [[GPE]]
what about the capture and kidnapping of civilian crew in the straights of [[PERSON]] i 'm sure there 's nothing illegal about that since you are from [[GPE]] . destroying an embassy , rocket attacks on oil fields ? paying terrorist organizations to kill [[NORP]] ?
[[ORG]] is a sad organization . tough noogies that this guy got vaporized . if [[GPE]] keeps this up we 'll hit them harder . say what you want about trump but he 's not kidding around .
hey agnes , we do n't care what you or the [[ORG]] thinks .
the [[ORG]] , pfftt ...
rapporteur . is that a synonym of biased , unthinking , [[GPE]] - backed and uneducated ?
ok agnes , so , when does the [[PERSON]] - in - chief obama 's trial at the [[GPE]] start ?
f the [[ORG]] .
this is why [[GPE]] will not sit back and fund the weak [[ORG]]
they started it , we will finish it .
“ outside the context of active hostilities , the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal , ” liberal doublespeak for , " they can do whatever they want but if you retaliate and anyone is killed we will try you in [[GPE]] .
i 've never had any good experiences in [[DATE]] of living on this planet , with anyone named ... [[ORG]] !
nothing on the attack on the [[ORG]] ? selective much ?
the [[ORG]] special rapporteur on extrajudicial killing .... that 's a made - up title , tright ? no one is really stupid enough to give an office in the [[ORG]] that name , are they ?
hey agnes , where were you during the [[PERSON]] admin 's unprecedented number of drone attacks ?
human rights for human garbage ?
so this is the [[ORG]] that [[NORP]] want to let control our gun rights ?
gee , a piece of trash from the [[NORP]] nations does n't like us . i 'm sooooooo hurt .
attack on the embassy in [[GPE]] violated human rights law .
