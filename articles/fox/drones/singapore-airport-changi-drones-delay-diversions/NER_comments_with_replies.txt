a jammer gun . a canon would be a lot more fun !
it would be , but those pesky rounds keep travelling for a long way .
aa ammo then .
what ? no caning ?
who are they suppose to be caning ? nobody 's been caught yet .
they 've said what the penalty is , and caning is conspicuously absent . i guess thinking that far ahead is beyond you .
i would gladly accept a full - time job with the airlines / aa 's to keep an eye out , man radar and then shoot these things out of the sky like [[NORP]] ... and the real [[NORP]] too .
