hopefully a brass screen ca n't defeat it .
[[GPE]] 's successful drone attack on [[NORP]] 's oil supply tells us that [[GPE]] is only [[ORDINAL]] to the [[GPE]] in the development , manufacture and operation of drones made using [[ORG]] . shoud we also assume that [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] are also making copies of these drones for their own use ?
hmmmm we tinker with our resources .
aim it at [[GPE]] leave it running
how much will a drone that is immune to a microwave weapon cost ?
[[ORG]] invented drones .
directed energy weapons . scary stuff . boil alive in your skull .
does it come in pistol size ?
where are the laser weapons we had been testing ? ! ? !
where can i buy one of these ? i had [[CARDINAL]] flying over my house [[DATE]] .
next time i see a drone flying over my property , i 'm bringing my microwave outside ...
masers predated lasers .
a microwave weapon to take down drones ? sorry , the [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] already possess such a weapon . it 's a giant rubber band that launches a microwave oven at drones flying overhead .
hopefully to make it super useful it comes with pre - sets , like defrost , poultry , popcorn , and drone .
but can it make popcorn ?
whose pockets in [[ORG]] are lined by raytheon ?
[[GPE]] unveils new [[ORG]] modeled on captured [[GPE]] rq-170 stealth drone on [[DATE]] , [[EVENT]] ( irgc ) unveiled a new combat unmanned aerial vehicle ( [[ORG]] ) called [[ORG]] ) during an expo showcasing the latest [[ORG]] projects of [[ORG]] . belonging to the [[PERSON]] class , the new drone is a long - range unmanned aerial vehicle capable of carrying [[CARDINAL]] precision - guided bombs , modeled on the [[NORP]] rq-170 sentinel stealth drone captured in [[DATE]] . commenting on the latest achievements by the [[ORG]] forces , commander of the irgc ’s [[ORG]] general [[PERSON]] said that “ [[DATE]] [[GPE]] has better aviation systems and equipment than the [[GPE]] and expressed hope that one day [[GPE]] will have the same might in the [[ORG]] industry as in the missile sector . ” so , it looks like the [[NORP]] have not only copied the rq-170 , but they have also developed something new based on the captured “ [[WORK_OF_ART]] ” whose crash landing in [[GPE]] remains a mystery . a sensibly smaller drone that retains the same wing shape as the sentinel but lacks the frontal air intake of the lockheed martin ’s stealth drone .
small dollar contract that is way too likely to be a bust . $ [[MONEY]] m is a pretty small development team , likely [[CARDINAL]] for not much longer than [[DATE]] . really hard to put that much energy into a beam and do any significant damage , especially if the drone has some simple counter measures against it . if it does have some serious energy , then everything behind it for [[QUANTITY]] is at risk as well , even past the horizon . leakage from the device , is likely to put friendlies at risk too ... aka the troops deploying it .
how fast will it cook a flying duck ? ?
we will sell them to the [[NORP]] . [[GPE]] gets them for free courtesy of the [[GPE]] taxpayers .
all those [[LOC]] swilling , mom 's basement dwelling gamers now have a purpose in life flying these things .
basically it 's a $ [[MONEY]] microwave oven with the door latch disabled . you know the military .
name it the rr 49 - 524 [[FAC]] .... won [[CARDINAL]] states and [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] . sdi / starwars lives on
can anyone say cancer .
for every measure there is a countermeasure .
pretty soon they ’ll have this thing called an [[ORG]] .. oh wait . raytheon better keep this out of the enemy ’s hands could be worth billions
which will now be countered because of a [[ORG]] news article .... [[ORG]]
vote for more [[NORP]] and you will see this beloved country of ours go down the drain . may god help us .
this renovating idea comes to them thanks to the old movie , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " , [[DATE]] ..
i got [[ORG]] that i bought for [[MONEY]] . i 'll let [[ORG]] have it for a quarter million .
you know ... what ’s wrong with the media . some things are matters of national security and [[ORG]] not be reported .
the [[NORP]] are now developing a [[ORG]] that can knock out intercepting missiles within [[QUANTITY]] radiius . it uses the chips from a smartphone to navigate and elude the attackers .
per the wreckage , the drones in [[GPE]] were well beyond the specs for this weapon ...
[[GPE]] 's microwave jammer can be installed on a drone pod and be secretly deployed and burn up enemy drones . both [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] are working with [[GPE]] in the development of more intelligent and lethal drones for their own military .
[[GPE]] is already making prototypes of the microwave jammer which leads the world in drone offensive technology . this top secret jammer recently destroyed a [[MONEY]] [[ORG]] .
[[CARDINAL]] is not very much money for research in such a game breaking area . if microwaves can bake a pizza in your kitchen just imagine what [[CARDINAL]] times as powerful version can do .
thank you president [[PERSON]] for supporting our great military .
i am confused ... it is in production stage but is already being deployed ?
terminator movies were not too far off
[[GPE]] – [[GPE]] rq-170 incident under [[WORK_OF_ART]] . on [[DATE]] , an [[NORP]] lockheed martin rq-170 sentinel unmanned aerial vehicle ( [[ORG]] ) was captured by [[NORP]] forces near the city of [[GPE]] in northeastern [[GPE]] . the [[NORP]] government announced that the [[ORG]] was brought down by its cyberwarfare unit which commandeered the aircraft and safely landed it , after initial reports from western news sources disputedly claimed that it had been " shot down " . the [[GPE]] government initially denied the claims but later president [[PERSON]] acknowledged that the downed aircraft was a [[GPE]] drone . [[GPE]] filed a complaint to the [[ORG]] over the airspace violation . obama asked [[GPE]] to return the drone . [[GPE]] is said to have produced drones based on the captured rq-170 .
really low and slow , a [[CARDINAL]] ga does the job for under a buck .
[[ORG]] , [[ORG]] should have kept this classified ( top secret ) . next , [[ORG]] will give [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , and [[GPE]] the blue prints ! ! ! ! enough said . heads should roll ! ! !
if it still looked like an ' oven ' , it would be better camouflage ....
if it can both deliver and pop popcorn , then we just may have the best drone yet .
let me guess , to some [[ORG]] 's cousin .
for [[MONEY]] , the military could buy [[CARDINAL]] hammers and a toilet seat
can it zap flying carpet
we are going to need these at every sports stadium . that 's coming next folks . so many people have come across our border we do n't know how many [[NORP]] are in this country . add in the so called [[PRODUCT]] ( they are not lone as they are being directed ) and attacks on large events by drone are not a matter of " if " but a matter of [[WORK_OF_ART]] .
so ... is this to protect us or to protect [[NORP]] oil ?
film / foil shielding [[GPE]] cage to protect your drone from microwaves . i ought to put that on ebay
cool !
crop circles were government tests of microwave technology . now they have experimented enough .
wow , that is pretty cheap !
the rq11 looks like a kid ’s glider ! how is this better than current anti- air weapons ? ?
can you say , nikola tesla
soon to be available to consumers by [[EVENT]] ? ? ? ?
will it heat up my hot pocket ?
it can take out enemy drones and cook a pizza in [[TIME]] .
