i ve closely photographed alligators here in east [[GPE]] and the everglades . unless harrassed they are generally lazy , unless they are hungry . if hungry they are lighting fast and voracious . this video shows an irresponsible individual who likely caused the ultimate death of the creature by coming so close . it may have seen it as a bird , a common prey item . it appears that the reptile swallows the drone parts and battery , which shorted out when water hit it . [[PERSON]] exposed potential animal cruelty , which here in [[GPE]] is a crime if intentional . while it may not have been intended . the outcome is the same .
mother nature never sleeps .
cool !
an alligator that attacks drones . i want one . alligator , that is .
cruel .
why is it necessary to harass animals with drones ? if the battery was ingested i would n't expect the alligator to survive and will probably have an agonizing death to the amusement of the laughing perpetrators
mmmmmmmm , smoked drone , my favorite
animal abuse . throw the book or the alligator at him !
i guess " george " needs a huge dose of [[PERSON]] otc ! ! !
i hates dragons . [[PERSON]] .
he thought it was [[PERSON]] watch
well , that gator is a goner . kids do n't do this at home . leave the wildlife a lone
reminded me of the [[ORG]] crash in the everglades yrs ago ; alligators were overheard saying " not a bad meal for a cheap flight "
the alligator ca n't be " fine " after burning his internal organs ! what is wrong with this society ? someone was teasing him ! ship the drone operator to [[GPE]] and trade him for someone with humanity .
find him and fine him .
the poor alligator thought that he hit the jackpot with snatching that giant flying bug - d'oh !
a new way to hunt alligators , drones with explosives . [[PRODUCT]] and gators should be extinct , they serve no beneficial purpose ..
i wish [[PERSON]] would go swimming there .
if the alligator did swallow the drone , then it needs to be captured and have it removed . otherwise , it will kill it . i would like to see if you could pass metal , plastic and a battery . i hope they catch whomever did this regardless where it happened .
gators are eating dead bodies in [[GPE]] , but gooberment officials have promised not to leave them behind .
that might look like fun to them but it is animal abuse and they likely killed the gator because batteries are n't made of cookie dough . they did not need to fly the drone at the reach of the gator ... cameras have something called zoom .
it 's basically idiots like this that have flying a drone as a hobby to the point of basically having to have a pilot 's license to fly them .
[[PERSON]] probably just killed the gator .
my heartburn goes out to the reptile
so [[PERSON]] user claimed the gator is doing fine ? what he is a [[GPE]] too besides being an idiot [[PERSON]] movie producer ?
hey fox news ! this is just [[CARDINAL]] more article with an interesting headline but with a irrelevant video . see alligator biting a drone ? no ! the video is about a crime in [[GPE]] , something in [[GPE]] , and another [[PERSON]] gaffe . please include the relevant pic or video in your articles ! please ! ! !
[[ORG]] , the alligator lives and the drone dies .
looks like my ex girlfriend chomping on my soul .
he was auditioning for a new [[PERSON]] role ! awesome water lizard .. awesome !
the can expect a visit from the [[ORG]] .
" alligator bites drone " is quite the understatement - he completely masticated it !
" alligator bites drone out the air " . why make headlines that read like an inner city public school 5th grader said it ?
i hope you parents out there are proud of your offsprind !
it is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse . does that mean they are going to hunt down this creature because it caused a drone to fall from the sky ? ? remember it is against the law to shoot down a drone in the [[GPE]] lol
that would be from the ' lithium [[ORG]] ' batteries being damaged . if he did n't spit out the drone quickly then he 'd receive major injuries . [[PERSON]] batteries burn fiercely when damaged .
no , the alligator will not digest the drone . plastics do not " digest " . they do have a disturbing habit of blocking the intestinal tracks of animals and killing them though so let 's hope that ' [[PERSON]] ' ( ? ) does n't end up starving to death .
bite off more than you could chew ?
i am fairly certain if the animal ingested the batteries and the majority of the electronics it just might not make it . of course that animals digestive system is probably pretty strong considering they can eat bone .
6s lipo cell is [[CARDINAL]] volts , some drones pull over [[DATE]] amps surge . lots of powah .
[[ORG]] has really caught on . .
a good fate for many drones .
drones are expensive gator bait .
that 's a spicy meatball ....
why all the annoying chatter ?
the gator now has " lipo " breath .
reminds me of sanfrannan .
someone may design [[CARDINAL]] small or large enough to invade pelosi 's and [[PERSON]] mouths . " jest " outta nowhere comes dis drone and " hits " me in da mouse" ..... pb
[[ORG]]
if it dies it wo n‚Äôt be a big deal .
hot tamale
i hope they put some ketchup on it .
i 'll that 's going to hurt coming out the other end !
he gon na need some tums .
uneducated fools . what did they think it would do . an alligator reacts to movement , and everything that moves is potential food . basic science . but what did i expect with the growing illiteracy of [[NORP]] ? young people are going to all be serfs and thralls [[DATE]] ; serving the elite who can afford to send their kids to private academies and ivy league universities . you all have my pity .
hope it does n't taint the meat .
those [[ORG]] batteries are not to be taken lightly .
in fl alligators are more important than people . in ca it 's coyotes .
this would n't have happened if the gator had been wearing a mask .
it was trumps drone ! and umm , fault too
i believe that ‚Äôs a felony if the gator dies or is injured . [[GPE]] wildlife officers should be investigating these fools and make sure they serve time .
talk about heartburn ...
pelosi 's skin is looking a little better since she 's been using that new cream ...
it ‚Äôs illegal to fly a drone in a national park . just sayin ‚Äô ‚Ä¶ .
it is hard for me to say which i fear more , ' gators or misused drones . but this time , i suppose , we score one for the gator .
[[GPE]] breath
so does the alligator get a visit from the [[ORG]] investigators ?
was it an [[FAC]] drone ?
that gator is like most humans who are being harassed by a drone . your [[ORDINAL]] instinct is to destroy the thing . hope the gator was n't harmed , but i applaud his actions .
the everglades national park prohibits flying drones . fine him for his ignorance then advertising it
a little common sense goes a long way ................................
the things our young people of today do will never cease to amaze ( and at times even anger ) me . the future of our country does n't look too bright once this generation of kids take control !
smoke [[PERSON]] go trump .
i hope the woman laughing gets hit by a car so i can laugh at her
[[CARDINAL]] big skeeter .
smarter than [[ORG]]
not funny at all
zoom is there for a reason
damn anti - vaxxer alligators

alm - alligator lives matter ! stop laughing you cruel whoever
the alligator was the instigator in this one . drones have rights too .
ahat flying that drone near the alligator needs to be charged criminally with harassing wildlife ...
there 's nothing funny about this video at all . that calls for the arrest of those guys . what they did was illegal ... endangering wildlife . flying a drone is unlawful on federal property . and i do n't care if it 's an alligator or not , that is just pure cruelty . why do n't we just dump battery acid on them or in their mouths and see if they think it 's funny then .
and i had cereal for diner .
what did the lesbian alligator say to the other lesbian alligator ‚Äú hmm taste like chicken ‚Äù
baiting an animal with a drone is animal abuse . anyone who thinks this is humorous ought to be investigated for posting similar abusive images . i hope someone reported this .
i do n't always tease ' gators with drones but when i do i drink dos equis . lots of dos equis .
gator said , next time , make sure [[PERSON]] is riding it .
needs more salt !
make some fine boots .
had a small drone i could fly with my phone indoors only . the cat hated it , and the dog wanted it bad . she finally got it , the end .
someone fly [[CARDINAL]] close to [[GPE]] .
just wait until that gator has to go # [[MONEY]] later
arrest and prosecute them for animal cruelty and improper disposal of a toxic battery .
drones need to have special warning labels that gators can understand . yup . pelosi should introduce a bill in the [[ORG]] that mandates it .
that 's what dinner used to look like at my grandmother 's house . spicy !
what is [[PRODUCT]]
[[PERSON]] ?
" oh my god he ' eating it " ........ honey , he 's an alligator ...... what did you think it would do ? ? ? ? are you blond by the way ? or just a millennial ?
that alligator is n't doing fine . burns to its mouth and throat and probably poisoned from that toxic battery . not funny .
that alligator 's probably dead now from eating the battery . hope they get charged .
alligator : " ooh ... spicy . "
kid must like buying drones . hope he 's got enough money to pay for the fine for killing the gator with those akaline batteries it ate .
bothering alligators is a crime unless you have a hunting license for them folks .
[[PERSON]] is the drone the gator is [[GPE]] .
" burp "
honestly i suspect the animal died or was severely injured . he appeared to be trying to spit it out but this is not a natural reaction for them , so he may have been unable to dislodge it .
just think what that battery in your electric car will do to you if you survive the crash .
i see [[PERSON]] stool softener in the critter 's future .
if the alligator dies the drone operator should be arrested and fined idiots
the drone owner is a racist .
where is peta ? any animal should be able to vape in public ! basic animal rights being infringed on lol
it 's just a alligator . there s [[CARDINAL]] of them out there . what s the big deal ?
gon na get a midnight knock on the front door by [[ORG]] ... that little trick is about to cost [[MONEY]] !
god bless the gator ... wish he could take a bite out of the idiots that are tormenting with the drone in the [[ORDINAL]] place .
well that stunt cost that guy [[MONEY]] anyway ...
why ca n't the writer put a simple little preposition ( of ) into the headline ? remember ... style and form .
black alligator lives matter
lithium battery tastes like chicken
getting within [[QUANTITY]] of wildlife with drones should be illegal . i do n't mind people using them to view wildlife from a distance , but when you 're flying that close to them , it 's wrong .
that 's [[CARDINAL]] dumb alligator . must be a [[NORP]] looking for a free lunch .
the idiot who did this should be charged .
are n‚Äôt alligators overpopulated in that region ? just saying
i 've lived in [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] and am around gators all the time . we have a gator hunting season for those lucky enough to draw tags . trust me when i say , there are too too many gators thus the hunting season . the way hunters catch / kill a gator would really upset you of you find this video disturbing . example : gut hook holding the gator for [[DATE]] , a harpoon or [[CARDINAL]] , finished off by a bang stick popping holes in the head . killing these dinosaurs is n't that easy .
why do n‚Äôt crocodiles like fast food ? because they ca n‚Äôt catch it !
alligator 1 , drone 0 . game over ! !
hate this . stupid people making animals suffer is not my thing .
harassing wildlife in the everglades is prohibited and flying drones in the everglades is prohibited . if they find the person who did this he can be facing a huge fine and possible cruelty to animals charge . it was not funny .
more useless tt videos . people always move the camera away from the action at the crucial moment . not worth sharing much less showing up on [[ORG]] .
must have been a ' libbie ' drone . full of hot air , gas , and inedible parts . poor alligator , gon na die of contamination ...
must be a [[NORP]] ...
feed him a scumbagbiden voter to soak up the lithium
[[ORG]] we filled his head with cannon balls üé∂ and powdered his behind üé∂ when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind üé∂
even if it dies ... it 's gon na be fine ... there are plenty more
damn that bird shocked me !
gators are protected .
pelosi ?
alligator live matter ! bring the little liberal nazis up on hate crimes ! !
psaki could do that so could pelosi unless her teeth fell out
libs wo n‚Äôt get past the [[ORDINAL]] [[CARDINAL]] words ‚Ä¶ too much trouble to read .
people get too uptight . alligators are like flies down there so who really cares about one croaking from eating a battery ? maybe they are n't supposed to be flying a drone but it looks like the area is vastly vacant so they are n't bothering anyone .
the alligator is dead . that battery kept burning after it was swallowed . it is a shame , but sometimes " instinct " can lead to " extinct " .
they should be charged with animal abuse . listening to them laugh was disgusting !
spy on me will you ? take that you flying jerk !
the alligator showed the drone who 's boss .
so does [[GPE]] spy on people who do n't have [[ORG]] but watch a clip through a news article ? if so , i wo n't open next time .
loss of a $ [[MONEY]] drone and a $ [[MONEY]] fine to go along with it ? i 'd call that [[DATE]] . they wo nt be laughing so much when they learn that the fines and jail time punishments for harming animals is more than raping a small human child .
well they will be able to track the gator for [[DATE]] with the puffs of smoke he fires off as he swims across the everglades .
torturing animals to increase views , making some easy money instead of getting a real job , so admirable .
[[ORG]] plastic for dinner . but that 's gon na hurt when it comes out .
[[PERSON]] ' like " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " on [[WORK_OF_ART]] .
[[PERSON]] blowing smoke up [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] azzes and now they have buyers remorse
ha ha .
on a side note , go gators ! chomp chomp
[[ORG]] . the alligator owns a [[ORG]] , so he 's used to smoking batteries .
nice catch big al , do n't puke
who can they sue to get damages for the drone ?
that 's [[CARDINAL]] bad animal , eats that thing belching fire and smoke and says " i 'll have another . "
why did n't the liberal fruitcakes throw him a bottle of [[GPE]] ? ?
alligators , like [[NORP]] , need [[ORG]] too .
smokin !
i 'll wager there 's a law about harassing wildlife and prohibiting the use of drones , if they were in everglades [[ORG]] . .
hate tic tok , most no less app for a nation full of mindless people . how does he or anyone the animal is ok ?
and the [[ORG]] lost his mind ....
hmmm .... can you imagine having a pound or [[CARDINAL]] of [[GPE]] in your stomach mixed with water ?
and the gator was heard saying , " a little spicy , but i 'd do it again . "
is n't this a form of animal harassment ? are alligators protected ?
those idiots . eating a battery releases acids into the animals stomach and mouth leading to a painful death . metal shards can tear open the esophagus , stomach and intestines . there are laws for interfering with wildlife and for them to be laughing at their own stupidity is shameful .
people really keep those things a safe distance from animals , period .
[[ORG]] , rip
" the [[ORG]] user also claimed that the alligator is doing fine after the incident , although that has not been confirmed " are they friends with the reptile ? did they pop in for a visit [[DATE]] ? morons ....
roflol !
big fine , double the amount of revenue from all the viewing hits and mandatory jail time for harassing wild life .
think of it as " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " ...
drone the swamp !
what a waste of a drone
pass the salt please .
aww poor gator
why dangle a participle , when you can just lop it off ?
see you later , [[PERSON]] !
in part iii , the gator shoots across lake okachobee like a torpedo at full speed .
does n't it say on the box : never bite a drone .... ?
i do n‚Äôt think that is going to come out well .
should be a blast to pass it .
other gator " phew , what you been eating ? how about light a match "
and the lady gators said , " he 's smokin hot ! "
hmmm ... does not taste like chicken ...
[[ORG]] , get those shaitheads from the air .
um all i saw was smoke
cute ! !
thanks to all that lithium , it 's now the most mellow ' gator in the swamp
headline reads : " alligator bites drone out the air ... " out the [[ORG]] ? ? ?
[[DATE]] we learned : alligators can not spit .
is the gator okay ?
sounds to me like the [[ORG]] should n't have attacked the drone . if it got hurt , oh well .
they just killed this creature by being a da ...
atsa some - a spicy - a meatballs !
my neighbor had a drone flying around blaring pornographic language . i finally had enough of it and shot it down with # [[MONEY]] bird shot . he called the cops and they took his side writing me a ticket . for making an obscene drone fall .
what is going on with the grammar of the headline ?
no .. not ok for a gator to eat a burning battery . i do n't know if he spit it out or not but .. i would n't be laughing . i would be scolding myself for trying to fly a drone so close without any thoughts of what might happen . at least the one guy said he felt terrible .
that drone must have been made by [[ORG]] ......
" the [[ORG]] user also claimed that the alligator is doing fine after the incident " .. unlikely .. remember the hoverboard fires .. ?
hope the moron goes to jail for this .
voices and language sound young , hopefully not to late to learn from this .
headline missing a preposition .
think that burns on the way in ? just wait until it goes out .
to the alligator it was a bird
hey [[PERSON]] watch this ‚Ä¶ .
i bet someone must using drone to harass the alligator .
.. ca n't be good for the gator ....
wait for it , the guy will be found and charged with something like endangering wildlife .
that drone 's gon na cause crone 's .......
they charged the gator with " [[PERSON]] ' battery . "
all drones should be eradicated . there should be a drone buy - back program , so that burn , loot , murder gangsta - thugs can use the money from the old - obsolete - drones - no - one - uses to buy new drones - you know , like they do with guns ? [[NORP]] - still owning slaves and bad decisions since before [[DATE]] .
that was intentional .
i think the crazy thing swallowed it !
that is me after eating at [[ORG]] or watching [[PERSON]] " raptor driving global warming alarmist " cuomo on [[NORP]] news network !
alligator was hoping for [[WORK_OF_ART]]
this is actually a [[NORP]] overdosing on ivermectin and ignorance .
hello , [[ORG]] ?
this is an unlawful harassment of an alligator , which violates [[GPE]] law . arrest this idiot .
now if that alligator had " jumped up and " snatched " that drone with its front legs you would really have had something . seriously , who writes and edits these articles ?
waiting for the ban on drones
wow , that 's even better than [[ORG]] .
he has now been charged with cruelty and harassment of animals . it went viral and now he faces some hefty fines .
there 's a reason these things have survived for [[DATE]] .
i like my food smoked too
[[NORP]] ! excellent . üëç üèª
idiots . both the drone owner and the gator !
the alligator got smoked !
with that assault and battery , guessing he 'll need some antacid .
ahh .... someone lost his toy ...... i hope the gator is ok .
[[PERSON]]
no alligators were harmed during the filming of this video ..
i took out a drone with my [[CARDINAL]] guage my neighbor had flown over our property [[DATE]] , it smoked too !
[[PERSON]] lost a son to an alligator attack .
actually this would be a felony , and it should be .
soooooo .. someone got [[TIME]] of [[ORG]] ......
we can spare an alligator or [[CARDINAL]] . how many [[NORP]] is biden sparing to play mr bigshot ? we know [[CARDINAL]] dead plus [[CARDINAL]] likely to be killed .
well , that ‚Äôs tasty ‚Ä¶ .
li - ion and water do n't mix well üßê
poor gator , thought that drone was a swallow .
guess this gator has never been taught , stop , drop and roll .
poor gator . i bet the drone did n't taste like a marshmallow .
alligator : if you gott'em i 'll smokim '
straight out of [[PERSON]] !
i suspect the out door is not as large as the in door . ouch .
[[DATE]] headline : ' gator dies from lithium poisoning '
is there any way we can get a certain senile old fool to swim with these guys ? would really enjoy the show .
harassment of wildlife - arrest them !
knock down all drones
now that will give you indigestion .
gator loves his cajun smoked bbq drones ! so hot and spicy ! ! ! now toss him an ice cold [[CARDINAL]] - pack of brews to wash it down !
looks like a strong case of heartburn in the making .
gator will make a drone belt .
we ‚Äôre not allowed to shoot down drones that enter our property but alligators are allowed to destroy them and get away with it ? good thing i live in [[GPE]] . i ‚Äôm getting one !
lord knows i needed a good laugh [[DATE]] .. thank you for posting !
could ‚Äôve used some tobassco sauce
i just had the pleasure of reporting this tiktok user to the [[NORP]] law enforcement ...
burp !
you are witnessing the creation of " robo - drone - gator " !
that alligator will now grow to the size of the gator in " rampage " and attack [[GPE]] . which is a good thing . maybe he will get mayor [[PERSON]] .
wonder if this idiot is going to get a visit from florida fish and game ?
why would it " struggle " with the done ? because drones are n't designed to be chewable ?
so if the alligator swallowed the battery i 'm guessing it will be a dead gator . why do people do stupid things ?
that 's nothing . it 's just [[GPE]] smoking a cigar while on vacation again .
stop dreaming about pizza delivery by drone .
a [[DATE]] + degree fire in his throat . the animal will starve to death in case you care . may drown before he starves to death ! should n't let children have dangerous vehicles . should be restricted to people that can make rational decisions at [[DATE]] older ! look at [[FAC]] need to raise the voting age above [[CARDINAL]] !
i do n't do tictok ... too much libdribb
alligators have no respect for [[PERSON]] ‚Äôs ‚Äú over the horizon capability ‚Äù probably a taligator .
i hope the alligator is really ok !
when i was [[DATE]] i could see myself doing that to a geaux - tur ........ lol
the biden " presidency , " visualized .
yeah lets go all electric its good for the environment .. yeah [[ORG]] ! !
where are the dam photo 's ?
these people should be arrested for this stunt .
i understand wanting to video an alligator ... but that is in the context of certain safety ( for the animal ) precautions . the drone should never have been in the gator 's reach .
harrassing wildlife is illegal , i believe , and should be harshly punished , in my opinion .
i think pelosi should fly her broom over there .
eating a lithium ion battery ca n't be good . when on fire they create their own oxygen and require huge amounts of water to put out ( more than what 's in a gator ! ) . this gator got heartburn , stomachburn , everything burn . add in the other non - digestable parts and the gator is certainly very ill and more likely dead . more idiocy from [[DATE]] 's yutes !
living garbage disposals . everything is food to them .
they will be tracked down . drones are illegal in [[LOC]]
bzerppppp ! ! ! üêä üöÅ ‚ö° ‚ö° ‚ö° üòÇ [[PERSON]]
funny , last time i checked it is illegal to fly a drone in a national park and , last time i checked the everglades are a national park ...
what jerks with the drone . anything for clicks . punishment is sending them to [[EVENT]] to pilot drones over [[PERSON]] - armed [[ORG]]
the girl thinks this is funny . pathetic
i liked it better when they were endangered
i would love to feed antifa members to aligators . now that 's worth filming ..
i doubt there is any do n't fly drones near alligators law on the books . it was an accident , drones are not cheap . if he is dumb enough to eat it who cares . its not like we are going to have a rash of , alligator deaths by drone eating , that threaten the population . it looks like it is in an everglade like area .
why do n't people leave animals alone .
spicy food , it was a tex mex drone
the drone should have been used . the damn alligator eats people and anything else . re - focus on getting rid of [[PERSON]] .
" mama says that alligators are ornery ... 'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush . ... "
tastes like , well maybe it does n't taste like chicken .
the alligator and i have a common enemy . personal space and some privacy is all that most of us animals want . great job mr al i. gator !
someone should have taken it away from the alligator .
that is just plain stupid . why would you do that to an alligator ? kids with too much time on their hands .
send an rc boat out filled with alka - seltzer .
worst tasting bird ever
that 's [[CARDINAL]] dumb alligator . must be a [[NORP]] .
please ! ! ! reported to the authorities ? give me a break ! ! ! the tattle tails are the same people who tell on their neighbors for not wearing masks inside their homes . save the alligators , kill our unborn . pathetic !
[[ORG]] shows part [[CARDINAL]] , this tiktoker is gon na blowup .
" alligator bites drone out the air " ummm should n't it be " out da air " ?
there in trouble against federal law to use a drone in a wilderness preserve , u will learn that when u get your drone license
devhlanger that fine is gon na be high dollar
over the horizon capabilities
talk about hot wings üò±
i had the same experience with some chili .
smoked gator , yum .
gator ? i do n't even know her !
" ca n't talk .... eating drone ... "
dang . that thing was hotter than tabasco sauce !
wonder what the drone vid looked like ... lol ...
[[NORP]] want to tax it for smoking .
the fact this brain bleeder is still using [[ORG]] ... that [[NORP]] owned , mostly developed in [[GPE]] app ... is a direct reflection of his inability at critical thinking . wake up [[GPE]] ... [[GPE]] is not our friend .
looks to me like the gator is enjoying the drone . of course there may be some indigestion a little later on .
i believe charges need to be brought against these people , since they purposely harassed the alligator ( a protected species ) and flew the drone so low the alligator could grab it . had this not be planned they would not have been filming it and they probably positioned and killed the alligator .
there 's a 10 footer in my mother in laaws lake behind the house . i 'm going to try this but put a big = = = hook on the drone .
am i reading the headline wrong ? should n‚Äôt it be out of the air ?
i go with the gator here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! its hard to chomp on one while its in flight
' alligator bites drone out the air ' am i the only one who has a problem with how this headline is written ?
" ... snatches the drone out of the air with its mouth . " animals do n't have mouths , they have maws .
[[ORG]] owner is probably a [[ORG]] should be arrested .
people are upset about an alligator versus the amount of people killed in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .....
‚Äú out the air ‚Äù ? ? ? proofread ! ! !
i did n't know [[ORG]] could swim .
it think it was a [[ORG]] .
if the gator dies , this deadbeat can be charged . it 's illegal . in fact , " harassing " gators is illegal in [[GPE]] . i hope this punk gets what 's coming to him .
video looks like some good evidence for [[LOC]] .
metal and plastic did n't taste too good .. later gater
the guy gator asked the gal gator if she smoked after sex , she replied , i do n't know i have never looked .
smoked gator tastes just like chicken
the gator is to young to smoke
no boots for you !
it all started with hold my beer , i can fly that .
ya think you ‚Äôre having water fowl for dinner and you get a grill full of propeller blades instead . just rude !
too many drone users have no respect for others should regulate where they can fly them .
just a conformation [[ORG]] users are idiots . the gator would not survive it !
some viewers , however , were not amused . after the video went viral , the uploader was reported to local authorities , [[NORP]] reports . other viewers debated over whether or not the footage was actually filmed in an area where drones are prohibited . these leftist whiners need a life .
expect a big hangover [[DATE]] ..
funny how some people get upset at the alligator with smoke but hardly any of the sensitive folk get upset with the [[ORG]] tearing up neighborhoods ? are they more scared of the [[ORG]] ?
if this is in the everglades as the story suggests , they are unlawfully flying a drone . if you want to fly a drone in a national park , you must get a very special permit given only for search and rescue , fire safety or research . if it 's outside of the national park , you could still be in serious trouble . flying [[CARDINAL]] within reach of a gator is very probably going to get you a serious fine . the gator is not the aggressor here . and that drone ca n't be good for the [[GPE]] . i 'll be watching as this story develops .
" hey guys , thanks for the drone . anybody got any [[EVENT]] ? "
[[PERSON]] !
but foist , these camoitials .
about as smart as my ex .
name it after bidens [[ORDINAL]] prostitute , it will swallow anything
holy cow [[PERSON]] crunch ) .. you got ta try this ! ( crunch crunch ) it is super spicy ! ! ( crunch crunch ) .. nope ... ca n't do it ... need water !
what about a residential drone that would attack spying - drones over your property ? i know it 's not alligator - related , but it just occurred to me .
[[GPE]] . always florida! ü§¶ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è
do n't lie , he was smoking a fattie ...
