[[ORG]] has been trying to add drone delivery for [[DATE]] . there 's no way to do it besides a closed campus scenario like this because of the privacy issues .
next , [[ORG]] will be using drones to deliver your packages . bye , ups delivery jobs .
dji is a [[NORP]] company .... just sayin !
all well and good . until [[DATE]] after this nonsense is permitted a [[CARDINAL]] passenger airliner is brought down after colliding with [[CARDINAL]] of these darn things . that should put and end to it .
you really do n't think there are checks in place to keep that from happening ? lol
i have a [[CARDINAL]] ga . shot gun and i will blow any drone out of the sky that comes over my property . i do n't care who or why . fly a drone over my house and it is dead .
go for it ! i would also expect a knock on the door from the [[ORG]] when all is done . shooting at a registered [[ORG]] is treated exactly the same as shooting at a manned aircraft . shoot away !
loser
hope they are not made in [[GPE]] drones .
they are .
its petty bad if you ca nt land an inspire [[CARDINAL]] within 10 ' of a target . " had to navigate obstacles " or you could fly up to 100 ' and go over everything and come back down . sure you ca nt fly line of sight but the range on an inspire is well over a mile . you could see it in [[CARDINAL]] on the monitor . this was a dumb exercise .
only time i crashed into something was by line of site . the camera give you a much better ideal of what is going on . you ca n't look at a drone over 500 ft away and tell its relationship to other objects . using the inspire 's camera you should be able to get within a foot or two of the target . heck i can fly a much smaller [[PERSON]] out [[QUANTITY]] and be confident that i can turn the controler off . go in the house and when i come back outside it will be within [[QUANTITY]] from where it took off .
in the not too distant future , we definitely will have less wheels on the ground ... what will [[ORG]] do ? ! ?
ups can do this but it takes them [[DATE]] to repair [[CARDINAL]] of their trucks .
great idea , treat people in their homes as long as you can . # winning
[[GPE]] has stepped up to the plate and has created software and donated drones . they wish to help [[GPE]] in it 's infrastructure .
the future ... drones being shot down and drones with self defense weapons to defend from said incoming . and in the end the attorneys will become more wealthy !
they 're not using the free [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] , right ? just askin ' .
and all that important they sent them about ... what exactly ?
alright already ! i hope they are nâ€™t made in [[GPE]] ?
they are . the doj issued a warning that the [[NORP]] manufacturer of those drones is required to provide information collected to the [[NORP]] government upon demand . [[CARDINAL]] of those drones were donated to [[CARDINAL]] states by the [[NORP]] . why do you think they would give them away ?
perhaps you should go through and read the full documents that were generated instead of just the one where there was all the fear - mongering to fit the agenda at the time
these clowns can not even deliver package to our office that is open [[CARDINAL]] to 5 . i do n't seem how they can deliver by drone .
