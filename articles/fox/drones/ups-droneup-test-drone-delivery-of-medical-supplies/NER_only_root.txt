[[ORG]] has been trying to add drone delivery for [[DATE]] . there 's no way to do it besides a closed campus scenario like this because of the privacy issues .
next , [[ORG]] will be using drones to deliver your packages . bye , ups delivery jobs .
dji is a [[NORP]] company .... just sayin !
all well and good . until [[DATE]] after this nonsense is permitted a [[CARDINAL]] passenger airliner is brought down after colliding with [[CARDINAL]] of these darn things . that should put and end to it .
i have a [[CARDINAL]] ga . shot gun and i will blow any drone out of the sky that comes over my property . i do n't care who or why . fly a drone over my house and it is dead .
hope they are not made in [[GPE]] drones .
its petty bad if you ca nt land an inspire [[CARDINAL]] within 10 ' of a target . " had to navigate obstacles " or you could fly up to 100 ' and go over everything and come back down . sure you ca nt fly line of sight but the range on an inspire is well over a mile . you could see it in [[CARDINAL]] on the monitor . this was a dumb exercise .
in the not too distant future , we definitely will have less wheels on the ground ... what will [[ORG]] do ? ! ?
ups can do this but it takes them [[DATE]] to repair [[CARDINAL]] of their trucks .
great idea , treat people in their homes as long as you can . # winning
[[GPE]] has stepped up to the plate and has created software and donated drones . they wish to help [[GPE]] in it 's infrastructure .
the future ... drones being shot down and drones with self defense weapons to defend from said incoming . and in the end the attorneys will become more wealthy !
they 're not using the free [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] , right ? just askin ' .
alright already ! i hope they are nâ€™t made in [[GPE]] ?
these clowns can not even deliver package to our office that is open [[CARDINAL]] to 5 . i do n't seem how they can deliver by drone .
