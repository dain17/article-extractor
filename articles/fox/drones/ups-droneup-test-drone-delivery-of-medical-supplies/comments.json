You can't look at a drone over 500 ft away and tell its relationship to other objects.  Using the Inspire's camera you should be able to get within a foot or two of the target.  Heck I can fly a much smaller Maverick out 2 miles and be confident that I can turn the controler off. Go in the house and when I come back outside it will be within a couple of feet from where it took off.",
