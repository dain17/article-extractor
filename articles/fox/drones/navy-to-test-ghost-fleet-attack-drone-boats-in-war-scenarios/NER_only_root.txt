i hope these developments recognize that greater dependence upong electronics and communications will spur greater efforts to target and deploy [[ORG]] weaponry , both tactical and regionally applied .
seems like ai controlled swarms are the big thing . but probably have already been around for [[DATE]] if we 're being honest .
i 'm guessing that each one of these cost [[MONEY]] . about the same as a [[PRODUCT]] . the [[ORG]] will be able add [[CARDINAL]] to the fleet in [[DATE]] .
ai war fighting machines . lets hope they [[DATE]] do n't decide to stop killing other machines and turn on us .
this is going to be a cluster ...
i 've always thought that we should be looking into using arial drones to jam enemy radar . launch a [[CARDINAL]] high radar profile drones ahead of an attack and while the enemy would know that an attack was coming , any radar based defenses would be rendered useless . the background clutter such a swarm would cause would enhance our stealth units ability to get in closer and be more effective .
i 'm for any technology that puts more distance between our warriors and harm .
this type of warfare is just fine . however we need way more training for when the power does go out . recommend reading the books ghost fleet and one second after .
it 's all fun and games until [[GPE]] becomes self aware !
pilotless boats seems alot less risky than cars , trucks or airplanes . sounds like a natural .
judgement day . just around the corner .
think the navy needs to bring back pt boats or [[ORG]] 's ? lol
all fun and games until the defender hacks the algorithem and redirects the swarm back to attack the host .
it 's amazing what the [[GPE]] military can develop when properly funded .
is n't this the same kind of boat that surrendered to the [[NORP]] speedboats w/o firing a shot , and then apologized for getting in their way ? the others had sailors on them . this one is better equipped w/o actual [[ORG]] men to surrender . the [[NORP]] got the other boat . this one can sink itself with a remote controlled white flag .
very cool . they should practice on sea pirates !
what people do nt seem to realize is that a boat without an operator can do a lot more high speed maneuvers . mount a few say tow missles on it and zig zag in close and put a few big holes at the water line of the enemy .
[[GPE]] ? is that you ? all kidding aside , check out the video on [[ORG]] atlas robot does parkour . can you imagine having [[CARDINAL]] of those things coming at you ? big nope .............
as cool as this all seems it 's decidedly uncool . the implications of where were headed is scary as f. soon humanity wo n't be necessary at all for the elite to accomplish whatever it is they want to accomplish and all this tech is doing nothing but giving them [[PERCENT]] control over us . this wo n't be like the movies . the only way to be free of these people will be to take out satellites - a nearly impossible task for the common man . we 're not going to like where all this leads .
why does it still have seats ? ?
some think it is great news we are coming up with a defense to counter the threat of swarm attacks--- personally i think it is great ( actually , [[ORG]] ! ) that in doing so we have come up with our our fleet of autonomous swarming attack boats !
great . skynet is upon us . we have to deal with [[ORG]] and now this ? just what we needed .
autonomous ... or [[PERSON]] ?
the [[ORG]] had a remote controller destroyer in [[DATE]] . i worked with that project for [[DATE]] as an active duty sailor working along side an array of very talented government engineers and other folks from various defense contractors etc .. freaking amazing stuff for the time . our main purpose was to test shipboard self defense weapon systems . what a blast that was .
just wait ... somebody 's going to hack one of those things and start their own little war .
ummm this stuff has been around for [[DATE]] . back when i was in in the 90 's . nothing new here . i guess new to the public ?
anybody else think that we are taking [[GPE]] way too far ? ?
