i hope these developments recognize that greater dependence upong electronics and communications will spur greater efforts to target and deploy [[ORG]] weaponry , both tactical and regionally applied .
we already shield communications equipment from [[ORG]] .
... to a certain extent .
yeah , you kinds hope they have thought of that . but you never really know .
seems like ai controlled swarms are the big thing . but probably have already been around for [[DATE]] if we 're being honest .
i 'm guessing that each one of these cost [[MONEY]] . about the same as a [[PRODUCT]] . the [[ORG]] will be able add [[CARDINAL]] to the fleet in [[DATE]] .
always guessing . yup .
ai war fighting machines . lets hope they [[DATE]] do n't decide to stop killing other machines and turn on us .
step away from the tv . meet people . discover reality , it 's fun !
using current tech video games as a model , i 'll be doubling up on body armor in the event of " friendly crossfire " . we 'll still need humans in the loop as it is not going to be what i would call difficult to spoof a friendly unit , unless they go for the " no [[NORP]] land " sceanrio where these bots just destroy anything that they find . in a naval encounter , i 'd like to bring [[QUANTITY]] to bear on a target without risking [[CARDINAL]] men . next big thing will be directed energy weapons , rail guns and the like have a place , but we need a more shall you say , global solution
this is going to be a cluster ...
i 've always thought that we should be looking into using arial drones to jam enemy radar . launch a [[CARDINAL]] high radar profile drones ahead of an attack and while the enemy would know that an attack was coming , any radar based defenses would be rendered useless . the background clutter such a swarm would cause would enhance our stealth units ability to get in closer and be more effective .
i 'm for any technology that puts more distance between our warriors and harm .
this type of warfare is just fine . however we need way more training for when the power does go out . recommend reading the books ghost fleet and one second after .
it 's all fun and games until [[GPE]] becomes self aware !
pilotless boats seems alot less risky than cars , trucks or airplanes . sounds like a natural .
judgement day . just around the corner .
in [[DATE]] according to the newly elected [[ORG]] woman ......
think the navy needs to bring back pt boats or [[ORG]] 's ? lol
all fun and games until the defender hacks the algorithem and redirects the swarm back to attack the host .
that is the by far biggest concern i personally have . must find a way to hackproof these buggers !
it 's amazing what the [[GPE]] military can develop when properly funded .
is n't this the same kind of boat that surrendered to the [[NORP]] speedboats w/o firing a shot , and then apologized for getting in their way ? the others had sailors on them . this one is better equipped w/o actual [[ORG]] men to surrender . the [[NORP]] got the other boat . this one can sink itself with a remote controlled white flag .
let me guess ... you never served ?
served ? yes . surrendered ? no .
very cool . they should practice on sea pirates !
what people do nt seem to realize is that a boat without an operator can do a lot more high speed maneuvers . mount a few say tow missles on it and zig zag in close and put a few big holes at the water line of the enemy .
[[GPE]] ? is that you ? all kidding aside , check out the video on [[ORG]] atlas robot does parkour . can you imagine having [[CARDINAL]] of those things coming at you ? big nope .............
as cool as this all seems it 's decidedly uncool . the implications of where were headed is scary as f. soon humanity wo n't be necessary at all for the elite to accomplish whatever it is they want to accomplish and all this tech is doing nothing but giving them [[PERCENT]] control over us . this wo n't be like the movies . the only way to be free of these people will be to take out satellites - a nearly impossible task for the common man . we 're not going to like where all this leads .
yep , indirect observation on just basic employment . kind of related to what you are pointing out . this " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " stuff has serious implications for just about every and all jobs you can dream up , as far as eventual replacement of human labor . not [[DATE]] , not [[DATE]] , but once it starts to cascade , it could be interesting times , for certain . the reality is we are already seeing it 's effects [[DATE]] , but its still relatively minor enough to be subtle and blend in with the background noise . but it 's coming , and the driver is [[ORG]] green ...
why does it still have seats ? ?
is it veni or weni ?
in [[DATE]] veni
some think it is great news we are coming up with a defense to counter the threat of swarm attacks--- personally i think it is great ( actually , [[ORG]] ! ) that in doing so we have come up with our our fleet of autonomous swarming attack boats !
machines that are programmed to kill humans ... yeah , nothing could possibly go wrong there ...
there are a lot of machines out there that could kill humans if something went wrong ( and it happens often ) . because people saw [[PRODUCT]] one time is not a good reason not to develop our military tech . you create safeguards and protocols with the machinery , just as you would with any other potentially dangerous non - military machinery . frankly , i am more concerned about the pack of human - piloted machines swarmed around me on the highway , then i am about the pack of autonomous machines swarming in some distant ocean on our enemies doorstep .
call me old fashioned ... i do n't trust machines ...
well to each their own . i ca n't argue with a luddite
i 'm not a luddite , i 'm just against tech thinking for itself ... you apparently do n't take everything into account ... [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , all of which can alter the programming of this self aware machines ... friendly fire is horrible , imagine an [[ORG]] of self aware war machines being hacked and now our [[ORG]] turns against us because the [[NORP]] has better hackers ... i 'm all for new tech , just not self aware tech .
none of this scares me as much a nuke being dropped by a human with a short temper and an itchy trigger finger , so i do n't see the point in worrying over it . as it stands these gun boats are n't [[ORG]] . they are just remote controlled boats ( " autonomous " )
well , then ... this debate is over . i have no problem with [[PERSON]] ...
great . skynet is upon us . we have to deal with [[ORG]] and now this ? just what we needed .
actually .. when ai realizes the danger that is [[ORG]] ; it will act accordingly , no ?
one can hope but these are unpredictable complex systems . [[PERSON]] might turn on the [[ORG]] .
autonomous ... or [[PERSON]] ?
i 'm ok with human controlled drones ... but not [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] has become aware .
the [[ORG]] had a remote controller destroyer in [[DATE]] . i worked with that project for [[DATE]] as an active duty sailor working along side an array of very talented government engineers and other folks from various defense contractors etc .. freaking amazing stuff for the time . our main purpose was to test shipboard self defense weapon systems . what a blast that was .
remote is different than [[GPE]]
just wait ... somebody 's going to hack one of those things and start their own little war .
ummm this stuff has been around for [[DATE]] . back when i was in in the 90 's . nothing new here . i guess new to the public ?
thanks .
anybody else think that we are taking [[GPE]] way too far ? ?
yup . this stuff is only getting cheaper too . what if it fell into the hands of our enemy .
