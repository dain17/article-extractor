i 'd like to know more about the drones . what brand , technical information .
i do believe there is a concern here . but why are they only worried about police using them . i think we should also be worried about corporations and private citizens using them .
we can have ours , you ca n't have yours just as the [[ORG]]
in a statement , [[ORG]] said it opposed police use of the technology . “ its continued unrestrained expansion will only further sow distrust and increase unequal treatment of our clients , ” just who are their clients ?
remember the movie scene from exterminator when they went to the future and robot and drones were attacking the people . or the movie scene from the matrix where they are fixing his eyes and he noticed police brought out drones and walking spiders , so he hid in a tub of water and off course the movie [[WORK_OF_ART]] . sounds [[GPE]] is heading in that direction and into the future .
not equipped with weapons . yet .
drones are a [[NORP]] dream come true . imagine in the future how they will be able to police . [[ORDINAL]] comes the face recognition , then the thought recognition ... then the liberal goons . people were a lot happier before the cell phone and internet .
as long as the [[ORG]] operates according to all [[ORG]] suas regulations , it should n't be a problem , but they wo n't have to because they are law enforcement and special . i imagine the regulations covering " transiting private property " wo nt ' apply either . oh , and if you shoot one down and ca n't prove they were over your property for the " purpose of surveillance " , you might be charged with destruction of property along with any other charges that might apply . you do n't own the airspace above your house . the [[ORG]] has control over that .
the nypd met with and provided a draft of its drone policy to [[ORG]] before completing its program . [[ORG]] associate legal director [[PERSON]] said he expressed concerns regarding police use of the technology . that 's right . lets go back to the old western days , use horses , and wear cowboy hats , guns slung on the sheriff 's hips . lets see how we can tie the hands of police , while the criminal elements are using everything they can , technology wise , to commit crimes .
the drone fleet will soon be known as “ [[GPE]] ”
see em ? shoot 'em .
i 've seen body camera footage of cops stealing from suspects and planting evidence . undoubtedly cops will use drones to break laws . with all the surveillance cameras everywhere , the cops do n't need this .
draw your shades
a new use for my [[CARDINAL]] g shotgun .
give them to fdny .
drones with cameras in the streets of [[LOC]] . this will not end well . nyers put this down immediately before you see pictures of your children in the bath propagated around the world .
its the future baby
the only way these could efficiently aid in law enforcement would be a violation of the [[ORDINAL]] amendment .
" oh c'mon ... when have we ever abused our authority ... ?"- the police
considering the massive traffic tie ups we have in our cities , it 's makes sense to use this technology from a public safety standpoint .
on the surface , considering the fact that [[GPE]] and the [[ORG]] are governed by a [[NORP]] mayor , the use of drones may be a concern about people 's privacy . i also believe the the [[ORG]] has a " [[ORG]] " that supposedly works with the police concerning the citizen 's rights in the face of new technology . that group should be involved in the usage of the drones on how and where they can be used . if my wife or daughter was sunbathing in the backyard , i might take steps to dispatch the drone to wherever dead drones go . on the other hand , if a bad guy was jumping fences in an attempt to escape the police , a drone would be useful in an area where it might be too dangerous to public safety to use a helicopter .
