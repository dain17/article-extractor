How many more billions of dollars are we going to waste on technology that does not work? To the next Republican president in 2024 shut down all departments in the United States government starting with the doj and the FBI let's not forget the CDC and EPA, reevaluate every department and every agency determine what ones are actually needed and what ones were pork. Do not reinstate the ones determined to be pork, the recession will be over, our taxes will decrease drastically sales tax will be gone and the country will be much better off. So what if 80% of the current United States government employees will be unemployed, a vast majority of them are liberals they need to learn what it feels like to be broke. That's the only way this country will get fixed.",
