now why did n’t the [[ORG]] just shoot them down ? then fish them out of the water and investigate if they were spying .
if these ufo 's can shut down our [[PERSON]] capabilities from a distance , i would n't shoot at them . big animals eat small ones , same with technology .
shoot down the unauthorize drones flying near the [[NORP]] war ship . when you do n't make intelligent decisions the enemy is observing your activity .
let 's see : [[QUANTITY]] from land . b. stayed up for [[TIME]] ( hard to believe - was it the same drone ? ) c. no other ships in sight . sounds like sailors on your own ship messing with you .
[[ORG]] , what is the deal ! what is offensive abt target practice at sea ?
you guys are big guy shoot em down ...
see where this is headed ? [[MONEY]] drones with small nuclear bombs attacking a [[MONEY]] aircraft carrier in all directions at the same time will easily take it out . any ship .
[[GPE]] is still working on their " mini - nuclear " weapon .
looks like a great opportunity for the crew to get some small arms practice .
yeah , and restrict it to " small arms , " like a scoped rifle . no point in burning up [[MONEY]] of ammo on a cheap drone .
probably not a cheap drone that can find and track a [[ORG]] destroyer [[PERSON]] .
on the surface , yes . but attacking the drones would give away our capability to the enemy . they did n't appear in danger so why show our hand . good thing we had a strong leader back then to get to the bottom of this .... /s
these nave ships did not know the drones intention , so why did n't they shoot the drones down ?
i think the commenters here are missing the point of this article . it does n't suggest that these " drones " are any other nations aircraft . perhaps the word " drone " is a little misleading . follow the link in the article to get a better understanding as to what actually happened . the report comes from recently released information through a [[ORG]] request . it 's pretty bizarre . our enemies do n't have stuff that does this . " the [[ORG]] vessels , which are equipped with sensors , radar , thermal imaging and electro - optical systems , were nonetheless unable to track the drones when they disappeared . "
so ....
" so .... " thank you so much for your thoughtful and intelligent response .
if they are commercial drones i would recommend target practice .
fake news !
probably came from [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] subs .
as they are “ un - manned ” why is there any hesitancy in shooting these things down ? they are clearly not authorized to be there , time for some live fire exercises , would be a good test of [[ORG]] defense capabilities , they should know if armed drones have the ability to penetrate [[ORG]] defenses .
what a shocker : agent [[PERSON]] of the [[ORG]] could n't find anything . same dude they assigned to [[PERSON]] 's email server ; to the [[PRODUCT]] investigation ; to the abuse of the [[LAW]] process ....
next time just use the phalanx on the ship . [[CARDINAL]] rounds per minute or [[CARDINAL]] rounds per [[ORDINAL]] . drones ? what drones ? we did n't see any drones ......
the tracking / fire control radar on vp relies on being able to " see " the target . target parameters may make this approach unfeasible
or a good sharp shooter with a scoped rifle . when they get close enough he can probably splat them .
where 's mr. [[PERSON]] and cpt . [[PERSON]] when you need them . ☺
it was captain [[PERSON]] from the time wars .
many drones spotted in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] back in [[DATE]] no organization or government claimed them to be theirs and no explanation . still want to know about them . my mind goes wild as to what they could be doing secretly .
[[NORP]] spies withing the [[GPE]] are responsible for a lot of drone activity in order to recon [[NORP]] restricted areas . you can use a commercially purchased drone and camera and if it gets destroyed no one can point back to " [[NORP]] . "
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] , " buzzed [[CARDINAL]] destroyers for [[DATE]] ? ? ? the destroyers surely made photographs and videos . where are they ?
exactly !
they may know more than they told
[[ORG]] and other services cost the [[NORP]] taxpayers lots of money . quit complaining about harassment and use these opportunities for live - fire defense exercises . the same goes for buzzing jets .
absolutely not ! that is exactly what our enemies want us to do . as soon as we start shooting we show our capabilities . that 's how they learn how to defeat our weapons .
so you 're saying the ships should just let the drones swarm them and do nothing ? your crazy .
i 'm crazy ? [[ORG]] did nothing . obviously i am right because they did exactly what i said they should do . or should n't do . try again .
i do n't think that you need a sophisticated weapons system to shoot down a drone ,
bull ! in this country all you have to do is read the right magazines and websites to find out what our military has . look at the people that just have to know what 's at area 51 . it 's none of their business what 's at area 51 ! shoot [[CARDINAL]] the things down , recover what s left and find out where it came from .
the point literally flew right over your head . we do not want our enemies to know our defenses . countries have been probing defenses since the beginning of time . i am obviously correct or they would have shot it down .
this is what is going to partially eliminate " true " ufo sightings , now everybody are just going assume they are drones .
have n’t seen a drone yet going [[QUANTITY]] and making [[QUANTITY]] turns .
good point
they had little flags attached that said [[PERSON]] said to come
[[CARDINAL]] is back !
the navy should have designated them target drones and opened up on them . problem solved .
excessive use of expensive munitions . just use a sharp shooter with a scoped rifle . when they get close enough he can knock them down .
and we are not capable to shoot these down ?
break out the shotguns ?
[[DATE]] 's era science fiction thought that aliens would not interact or interfere with us ( earthlings ) until we achieved consistent space flight . maybe [[PERSON]] has pushed our species over the threshold for [[ORDINAL]] contact .
uh .......... roger that " maybe . " out
if those destroyers used what the had onboard then it would have taken [[TIME]] for [[ORG]] 's to be taken care of .
the simple solution would be to blow them out of the sky , if they are not our military controlling them . also the could be tracked to wherever they are headed , i would think .
that is exactly what our enemies want us to do . as soon as we start shooting we show our capabilities . that 's how they learn how to defeat our weapons .
by shooting a drown down close to military ships ? ? trust me , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] would do it in a heartbeat . they are already buzzing our ships and [[ORG]] , and playing come and chase me , near [[GPE]] in [[GPE]] .
how is this a hard concept ? we do n't show our capabilities if they are n't harming us . if we start shooting then they know exactly what our defenses are . it 's the whole reason they buzz us . they are probing us . trying to see if we will tip our hand . i 'm sorry you have no military experience or training .
so they just let them ? seems to me there should have been a few drones floating in the water .
surely they took video . let 's see the video .
hey [[ORG]] , what 's the problem ! ever hear of " target practice . " use the drones as clay pigeons and have at it .
all that equipment and jammers but a drone can buzz around the ship unimpeded then disappear ? ? sounds gps guided being [[QUANTITY]] out .
does n't destroyers have a modern version of a minigun that can shoot down incoming missiles ? why did n't they use it ?
use those phalanx guns !
i doubt they thought they were simple drones . probably were worried they were craft occupied by et . shoot at it and the ships may be targeted in response .
did [[PERSON]] disarm them ?
should have fired up [[PRODUCT]] and taken them out .
no a 12 ga with bird shot .
that works , but most [[ORG]] ships only have a couple of those on board and [[CARDINAL]] buck , for intruder defense . phalanx can fire [[QUANTITY]] rounds at [[CARDINAL]] / min and the newer version at [[DATE]] / min . your idea would be more fun .
you must be a dem , you want to spend [[CARDINAL]] on a $ [[MONEY]] problem .
you must be an idiot to assume there was anything political in my comment . i served most of my career under [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] . they were responsible for the major increases in military spending . [[PERSON]] was president my first 2 years and [[PERSON]] for my [[DATE]] . carter did nothing and [[PERSON]] made severe cuts to the armed forces in terms of equipment and personnel . seems to me the [[NORP]] do n't want to spend money on something they abhor . btw , i vote straight [[NORP]] if you absolutely have to know .
get a sense of humor . i did [[CARDINAL]] with dod . [[CARDINAL]] [[PERSON]] is still over kill .
my sense of humor gets deep sixed when someone injects politics into a non political comment . sure it 's overkill , and i do believe i said your method would be more fun , but nothing beats the sound of those r2d2s when they let loose .
not politics just a statement of fact , liberals will spend [[MONEY]] on a [[MONEY]] problem .
no disagreement there .
must have fantastic batteries if they can pace a navy ship for [[TIME]] .
do n't they have shotguns aboard ship ?
[[MONEY]] war ship ca n't defend itself from a drone now that is funny !
turn the sea wiz on ... problem solved .
i would suspect drones released from a near by sub . how else , except for [[ORG]] , could you control a drone from any distance ? the article stated the drones made several daring maneuvers . it is not uncommon to have enemy subs or warships shadowing our naval vessels during exercises .
the days of automated drones are here . the question is who is their master and why are they here .
target practice
a missed opportunity for live target practice .
add the new thor or phaser anti drone microwave weapons to the ships . it can take down swarms of drones .
being a warship , which are usually armed , would n't it make sense to just blow them out of the sky ? or were they waiting for orders ? i guess this is [[DATE]] 's [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] could n't take the call she was busy writing up more executive orders for old [[PERSON]] to sign before putting him back to bed .
2019 was not her year lol .
a shotgun to bring them down would be a good idea . otherwise if they are a little higher up then use them as a " test " .
they have vulcan anti - missile systems that shoot a river of depleted uranium . better yet give the boys [[CARDINAL]] gauges with 00 and it a a beer for every one downed .
why would n't the [[ORG]] have the right to fire at them ?
a kazillion dollars spent on [[ORG]] destroyer tracking systems but they were outsmarted by the drones and their owners ? when did n't the destroyers use their sophisticated weaponry to eliminate the drones ?
that was my immediate thought you got this massive destroyer with all kinds of technology and i ca n’t figure out how these drones can be tracking them , who owns them and what they ’re doing ?
there is a smart move start shooting things out of the sky that you know nothing about . if by some outside chance these drones were of an alien origin that move would more than likely backfire in a very bad way .
it was [[GPE]] testing our drone killing capabilities . glad the captains did n't take the bait .
old story . i would guess the incident was classified until an investigation was completed by either the [[ORG]] , the [[ORG]] or both . full choke [[CARDINAL]] gauges with bird shot should do the trick for future incidents .
they could prove to be a much greater threat than at a distance bird shot could take them down .
so , i was n't the only one thinkin ' it . good .
you would think a [[GPE]] warship could at will bring down a " drone " electronically . just do it for goodness sake !
need a couple of [[DATE]] 's to intercept and [[ORG]] the drone control freqs !
did nt the [[ORG]] shoot down a satellite [[QUANTITY]] above earths atmosphere back in [[DATE]] or something
the [[NORP]] have done it also to a derelict satellite in orbit .
that ’s what the cewiz , or however you spell it , is for .
apparently no pics either . more here than meets the eye .
i call click - bait .
pull !
how can drones " harass " a warship ? would n't it be like swatting flies ?
no photos of the drones ? why not ?
classified ?
they were ufo 's
" gort : klaatu nikto barada "
[[PERSON]] said they were seeking asylum so do nt stop them
[[PERSON]] .
what i do n't get is why they did n't shoot them right out of the sky ... 🤨
apparently because no [[NORP]] were on this vessel . lol
ammunition is expensive . and the " paperwork / investigations " of a shooting incident are obscene . plus , the drones did n't seem to be any kind of a threat , just a curiosity . apparently the media is typically much more hysterical about this incident that the military is .
[[PERSON]] did n't seem to be a threat , just a [[NORP]] clown .
it 's hard to get ammo [[DATE]] .
you 'd think the [[ORG]] would have a way of deactivating unmanned aircraft
they do . simply use the electronic countermeasures equipment on the ship to jam the drones controlling frequency . it 's apparent that the [[ORG]] was far far less concerned about these things than the hysterical media was .
sounds like rifle practice is in order and its open season on drones . i 'd have no problems with that .
never had drone meat before sounds like an opportunity
rifles ? better call the [[NORP]] . haha
a warship is afraid of a drone ? really ?
drones carry payloads . and if there were explosives being carried , then these could have caused significant damage to antennas and electronic systems or killed people on deck . and no one except [[ORG]] said they were afraid .
we did not define them as military predator drones . the drones you can buy at best buy do n't carry much weight . it would be an interesting experiment for [[NORP]] to see how lethal one could be . as far as afraid , how about annoyed ? better now ?
[[ORG]] should 've handled it .
[[PERSON]] delivering a love letter to [[ORG]] .
i am sure that this can all be explained by a highly educated ancient alien astronaut theorist . just give them a chance .
if you read the in - depth reporting on the matter , [[CARDINAL]] thing stands out - the drones were active for [[TIME]] , at sea , which is far longer than the average consumer drone capacity . it would not be surprising if there are squads of [[NORP]] operatives residing in the [[GPE]] , simply waiting for war to break out .
[[ORG]] does n't have to wait for [[PERSON]] 's permission to shoot them down . just do it !
and they are all in [[GPE]] 's , [[GPE]] , and [[PERSON]] 's , districts .
they were also [[QUANTITY]] offshore . too far for private or commercial drones .
where there ’s a will there ’s a way . the assumption that the same drones operated for the entire duration of the incident without refueling is open to question . the aerodynamics , flight duration , and flight maneuvers would invite discussion of the power plant capability . along with payload .
could it be [[NORP]] dropping off goodies to our sailors ?
they need to use anti - drone weapons or jammers to bring it down . take the downed device and find out what is captured . the person who complains to the navy about damaging their drone should be charged for entering a restricted area .
or just a high pressure hose .
probably are own .
sounds like time for [[CARDINAL]] cal practice
you know what else [[ORG]] warships are equipped with ? anti - aircraft guns . fully justified in shooting them down .
[[ORG]] , never fired at small moving aircraft , eh ?
yep . pretty good record with a [[QUANTITY]] , not bad with a 7.62x54r. but never had a chance to pop a shot off with a laser - guided .60 at [[CARDINAL]] rounds per minute ( [[NORP]] ) , or laser - and - radar guided anti - aircraft missile , but i 'd be glad to try my hand at it . pretty good at calculating firing solutions .
use the phalanx or [[CARDINAL]] of the [[CARDINAL]] m-2s ...
[[ORG]] , put air vortex cannons on ships .
so these ships ca n't shoot down the drones ?
rules of engagement prevent that .
there are rules of engagement with drones ?
and what are the rules of engagement for drones ?
[[NORP]] test run
launched from a pod from a nearby sub ?
or dropped and recovered from an aircraft operated by terrorists or spies .
a joint venture with [[ORG]] from a rubber boat
thanks for [[DATE]] news .
should have shot them down ........ would've saved me from having to read this article from an event in [[DATE]] .
shoot them down . end of problem . what were they spying on anyway ?
soooo " swarms " consist of [[CARDINAL]] toys ... k ... gotcha
