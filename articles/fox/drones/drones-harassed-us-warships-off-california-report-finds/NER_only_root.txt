now why did n‚Äôt the [[ORG]] just shoot them down ? then fish them out of the water and investigate if they were spying .
if these ufo 's can shut down our [[PERSON]] capabilities from a distance , i would n't shoot at them . big animals eat small ones , same with technology .
shoot down the unauthorize drones flying near the [[NORP]] war ship . when you do n't make intelligent decisions the enemy is observing your activity .
let 's see : [[QUANTITY]] from land . b. stayed up for [[TIME]] ( hard to believe - was it the same drone ? ) c. no other ships in sight . sounds like sailors on your own ship messing with you .
[[ORG]] , what is the deal ! what is offensive abt target practice at sea ?
you guys are big guy shoot em down ...
see where this is headed ? [[MONEY]] drones with small nuclear bombs attacking a [[MONEY]] aircraft carrier in all directions at the same time will easily take it out . any ship .
looks like a great opportunity for the crew to get some small arms practice .
these nave ships did not know the drones intention , so why did n't they shoot the drones down ?
i think the commenters here are missing the point of this article . it does n't suggest that these " drones " are any other nations aircraft . perhaps the word " drone " is a little misleading . follow the link in the article to get a better understanding as to what actually happened . the report comes from recently released information through a [[ORG]] request . it 's pretty bizarre . our enemies do n't have stuff that does this . " the [[ORG]] vessels , which are equipped with sensors , radar , thermal imaging and electro - optical systems , were nonetheless unable to track the drones when they disappeared . "
if they are commercial drones i would recommend target practice .
fake news !
probably came from [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] subs .
as they are ‚Äú un - manned ‚Äù why is there any hesitancy in shooting these things down ? they are clearly not authorized to be there , time for some live fire exercises , would be a good test of [[ORG]] defense capabilities , they should know if armed drones have the ability to penetrate [[ORG]] defenses .
what a shocker : agent [[PERSON]] of the [[ORG]] could n't find anything . same dude they assigned to [[PERSON]] 's email server ; to the [[PRODUCT]] investigation ; to the abuse of the [[LAW]] process ....
next time just use the phalanx on the ship . [[CARDINAL]] rounds per minute or [[CARDINAL]] rounds per [[ORDINAL]] . drones ? what drones ? we did n't see any drones ......
where 's mr. [[PERSON]] and cpt . [[PERSON]] when you need them . ‚ò∫
many drones spotted in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] back in [[DATE]] no organization or government claimed them to be theirs and no explanation . still want to know about them . my mind goes wild as to what they could be doing secretly .
" [[WORK_OF_ART]] , " buzzed [[CARDINAL]] destroyers for [[DATE]] ? ? ? the destroyers surely made photographs and videos . where are they ?
they may know more than they told
[[ORG]] and other services cost the [[NORP]] taxpayers lots of money . quit complaining about harassment and use these opportunities for live - fire defense exercises . the same goes for buzzing jets .
this is what is going to partially eliminate " true " ufo sightings , now everybody are just going assume they are drones .
they had little flags attached that said [[PERSON]] said to come
the navy should have designated them target drones and opened up on them . problem solved .
and we are not capable to shoot these down ?
break out the shotguns ?
[[DATE]] 's era science fiction thought that aliens would not interact or interfere with us ( earthlings ) until we achieved consistent space flight . maybe [[PERSON]] has pushed our species over the threshold for [[ORDINAL]] contact .
if those destroyers used what the had onboard then it would have taken [[TIME]] for [[ORG]] 's to be taken care of .
the simple solution would be to blow them out of the sky , if they are not our military controlling them . also the could be tracked to wherever they are headed , i would think .
so they just let them ? seems to me there should have been a few drones floating in the water .
surely they took video . let 's see the video .
hey [[ORG]] , what 's the problem ! ever hear of " target practice . " use the drones as clay pigeons and have at it .
all that equipment and jammers but a drone can buzz around the ship unimpeded then disappear ? ? sounds gps guided being [[QUANTITY]] out .
does n't destroyers have a modern version of a minigun that can shoot down incoming missiles ? why did n't they use it ?
use those phalanx guns !
i doubt they thought they were simple drones . probably were worried they were craft occupied by et . shoot at it and the ships may be targeted in response .
did [[PERSON]] disarm them ?
should have fired up [[PRODUCT]] and taken them out .
must have fantastic batteries if they can pace a navy ship for [[TIME]] .
do n't they have shotguns aboard ship ?
[[MONEY]] war ship ca n't defend itself from a drone now that is funny !
turn the sea wiz on ... problem solved .
i would suspect drones released from a near by sub . how else , except for [[ORG]] , could you control a drone from any distance ? the article stated the drones made several daring maneuvers . it is not uncommon to have enemy subs or warships shadowing our naval vessels during exercises .
target practice
a missed opportunity for live target practice .
add the new thor or phaser anti drone microwave weapons to the ships . it can take down swarms of drones .
being a warship , which are usually armed , would n't it make sense to just blow them out of the sky ? or were they waiting for orders ? i guess this is [[DATE]] 's [[ORG]] .
a shotgun to bring them down would be a good idea . otherwise if they are a little higher up then use them as a " test " .
they have vulcan anti - missile systems that shoot a river of depleted uranium . better yet give the boys [[CARDINAL]] gauges with 00 and it a a beer for every one downed .
why would n't the [[ORG]] have the right to fire at them ?
a kazillion dollars spent on [[ORG]] destroyer tracking systems but they were outsmarted by the drones and their owners ? when did n't the destroyers use their sophisticated weaponry to eliminate the drones ?
it was [[GPE]] testing our drone killing capabilities . glad the captains did n't take the bait .
old story . i would guess the incident was classified until an investigation was completed by either the [[ORG]] , the [[ORG]] or both . full choke [[CARDINAL]] gauges with bird shot should do the trick for future incidents .
you would think a [[GPE]] warship could at will bring down a " drone " electronically . just do it for goodness sake !
need a couple of [[DATE]] 's to intercept and [[ORG]] the drone control freqs !
did nt the [[ORG]] shoot down a satellite [[QUANTITY]] above earths atmosphere back in [[DATE]] or something
that ‚Äôs what the cewiz , or however you spell it , is for .
apparently no pics either . more here than meets the eye .
i call click - bait .
pull !
how can drones " harass " a warship ? would n't it be like swatting flies ?
no photos of the drones ? why not ?
they were ufo 's
[[PERSON]] said they were seeking asylum so do nt stop them
[[PERSON]] .
what i do n't get is why they did n't shoot them right out of the sky ... ü§®
you 'd think the [[ORG]] would have a way of deactivating unmanned aircraft
sounds like rifle practice is in order and its open season on drones . i 'd have no problems with that .
a warship is afraid of a drone ? really ?
[[ORG]] should 've handled it .
[[PERSON]] delivering a love letter to [[ORG]] .
i am sure that this can all be explained by a highly educated ancient alien astronaut theorist . just give them a chance .
if you read the in - depth reporting on the matter , [[CARDINAL]] thing stands out - the drones were active for [[TIME]] , at sea , which is far longer than the average consumer drone capacity . it would not be surprising if there are squads of [[NORP]] operatives residing in the [[GPE]] , simply waiting for war to break out .
sounds like time for [[CARDINAL]] cal practice
you know what else [[ORG]] warships are equipped with ? anti - aircraft guns . fully justified in shooting them down .
use the phalanx or [[CARDINAL]] of the [[CARDINAL]] m-2s ...
[[ORG]] , put air vortex cannons on ships .
so these ships ca n't shoot down the drones ?
[[NORP]] test run
thanks for [[DATE]] news .
should have shot them down ........ would've saved me from having to read this article from an event in [[DATE]] .
shoot them down . end of problem . what were they spying on anyway ?
soooo " swarms " consist of [[CARDINAL]] toys ... k ... gotcha
