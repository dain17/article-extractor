They are super loud.\n3. They dont have xray vision.\n4. No massive zoom cababilites \n    They dont have camcorder like zoom.\n5. Because a drone is hovering does not mean its looking down at you, do you all think your that interesting? Give me a break. Its probably looking at the sunset or clouds doing a time lapse.\n\nYour worried about  privacy yet everyone has a cell phone with a camera and you more likely to be spied on with that or a camcorder with a 300x zoom.\n\nYou talk of shooting guns in the air and dont realize bullets come down fast....so think long and hard before shooting in the air and killing a kid with your stray bullets...\n\nAll I can say is wow to the level of misinformation going on here....educate yourselves before going on about consumer drones.",
