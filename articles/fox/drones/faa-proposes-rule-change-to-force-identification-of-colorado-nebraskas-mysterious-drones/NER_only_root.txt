oh , stop droning on . it 's just some guy proving that he can do it . some multi - drone software thing he comes up with . trying to track and regulate drones is useless . the technology is " out of the closet ! "
i had a drone follow me while walking down the sidewalk once . it was [[QUANTITY]] up in the air and probably legal for the operator to do so , but to me it seems like a creepy thing to do .
comments section - aka , microcosm of everything wrong in this country .
i have a question ... maybe someone here has the answer : if i see a drone flying over my property at low altitude , do i have the right to shoot it down ?
it was probably a group of guys having a little fun with their drones . nothing a nice .22 rifle could n't stop .
how many drones in a " swarm " ?
how can there be " nothing illegal " on [[CARDINAL]] hand , but one needs " [[ORG]] permission to fly multiple small drones at [[TIME]] " ?
wow , after reading these comments you people have no idea what consumer drones can really do .. 1 . no mic [[CARDINAL]] . wide angle lenses make things look further away so to spy on your pool the drone would need to be [[QUANTITY]] away , if its [[QUANTITY]] away people are not identifiable . [[CARDINAL]] they are super loud . [[CARDINAL]] they do nt have xray vision . [[CARDINAL]] . no massive zoom cababilites they do nt have camcorder like zoom . [[CARDINAL]] because a drone is hovering does not mean its looking down at you , do you all think your that interesting ? give me a break . its probably looking at the sunset or clouds doing a time lapse . your worried about privacy yet everyone has a cell phone with a camera and you more likely to be spied on with that or a camcorder with a [[NORP]] zoom . you talk of shooting guns in the air and do nt realize bullets come down fast .... so think long and hard before shooting in the air and killing a kid with your stray bullets ... all i can say is wow to the level of misinformation going on here .... educate yourselves before going on about consumer drones .
enforcement may be difficult .
drones should be governed the same way any aircraft are . they need to be licensed , the operators need to be licensed , and the drones need to have electronic identification , just like an aircraft . we have almost all of these features for automobiles , and for good reason .
[[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] still looking for [[NORP]] collusion
i see a drone over my house , my [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] browning is going to get some exercise
it 's the [[PERSON]] doing it . if enough people get bent out of shape , they can get some laws changed so that any drone can be confiscated by the local constabulary . just another ploy to reduce your rights . the cops do n't own the air .
guess what people the whole id thing the [[ORG]] is proposing exempts [[GPE]] government drones and law enforcement so being able to id your neighbors toy drone wo nt help you and the ones you paranoid people should be worried about are exempt ..... if the huge [[QUANTITY]] drones flying over [[GPE]] boondocks are [[GPE]] government guess what they do nt have to take part in any id scam perpetrated on the tax payers of this country .
it would be a small matter to require all drones over a certain size to have assigned and registered tail numbers just like regular aircraft do and respond with that number in monitored air traffic . a small drone like a kid gets for playing in the house or backyard do not pose any danger but the large commercial drones could take down an aircraft just like hitting large birds like [[NORP]] do .
there is obviously mass misinformation on consumer drones and there abilities all the nice people talking about shooting down drones what are you going to do when really big amazon , ups , google etc drones are flying over your house on a [[DATE]] basis .... oh how the neighbors mavic will not even be an issue .... the big companies are the ones you need to be worried about , a mavic wo nt kill you but a [[QUANTITY]] ups drone will and you will have no way to know what they are doing with the data from their cams and since they will be flying often they will make perfect targets for hackers . wait until a north [[NORP]] hacker crashes one into someone 's house or car . ya be worried about the small mavic flying over looking at the sunset .....
well this is a company testing drone swarm tech , ie darpa . or the [[GPE]] military testing . of course there going to deny any involvment on a project that does nt exist . when there s a top secret program being developed and technology . most within the pentegon and arm forces do nt know about it . its compartmentalized . not even top command at times knows what the research divisions or [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] are up to . so if there so concerned about the drones , get some [[LOC]] vision headsts and get out the shot guns and shoot a few down / there will be subtle heat signiture from the batery and motors in the contrast to the cool night sky ,
if they are not breaking any laws , why are you chasing them ?
this is a [[GPE]] headline . the sightings here in [[GPE]] have nothing to do with the remote id nprm that was published [[DATE]] . please get your facts straight mr. ( or ms. ) headline writer .
the [[ORG]] force denied it was them . uh - huh .
i expect their flying weed into [[GPE]] i would imagine law enforcement knows that
[[ORG]] looking for weed .
it 's the [[NORP]] .
if something nefarious is really going on ( i.e. drug cartels ) , do you really they will comply with any new identification regulations ? kind of like " gun free zones " do n't you think ?
not going to condone shooting one , especially of this size , but there is a really fun [[ORG]] talk about messing with the local kids drones that 's worth watching .
they 're probably police drones to begin with . during every holiday gathering the police are always flying drones over and nearby the crowds . it 's a cheap and easy way to get a big picture .
since their flight times and locations are fairly well known why has n't anyone - private or government - sent their own drone up to follow them to their base ? someone knows what is going on and does n't want the perpetrators caught .
think about it . [[ORG]] is not so far away from where this sophisticated drone operation is going on . peterson af and [[PERSON]] as well . top secret military bases nearby monitoring [[LOC]] 24/7 , and they say they know nothing about this ? do n't take that at face value .
use a shotgun on one and see who squawks .
really its probably the law themselves . [[CARDINAL]] way to get a law written and on the books.thet create said problem and poof wow they have the solution . here 's a new law we get t slap you with .
forget the law . if they fly over your property , just shoot them down . end of problem .
i do n't think these drone sightings prompted the [[ORG]] to announce anything , i got the notification from the [[ORG]] on [[CARDINAL]] before this story came out . and it is just a [[DATE]] request for comment , nothing is concrete yet .
all civilian drones should have a transponder with identification .
if ca n’t identify drones , electronically jam them to bring them down . drones are [[PERSON]] horse for the [[NORP]] ... most are made in [[GPE]] , and these transmit data to [[NORP]] cloud , where government has control .
military test flights ...
oops i m sorry i was crow shooting on my own property and one flew into my line of fire ..... my bad
this is likely a geological search for uranium or other mineral using sensitive radiation detection or other technology . just a guess , but possible . uranium does exist in [[GPE]] .
guys , in an effort to keep you out of trouble , please [[PRODUCT]] shoot down drones , it ’s big time illegal and many have already gone to jail over it . as a drone pilot myself , here ’s what i would do if someone was spying on me : to take down a spying drone and stay out of jail , buy a cheap drone and “ accidentally ” fly it into the spying drone ; it will crash immediately . this way you ’re not shooting it down and potentially going to jail , like i mentioned before about it being illegal to shoot any aircraft out of the sky , because in this case it was just an “ accident ” . trust me , i ’m just trying to help .
shoot [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] down and watch to see who comes looking for them . the [[PERSON]] are flying in a swarm . ie many flying in formation , doing the same things , until .
drones at [[TIME]] perfect terrorists weapon .
drones need to be identifiable anyway . there have been a number of cases of airports having to temporarily be shut down because of drones operating too closely , which obviously is illegal and dangerous . and at the moment there 's no way to identify them .
it 's drug delivery , duh . already common .
ar-15 with several banana clips .
nothing that ca n't be solved with a few loads of # [[MONEY]]
i guess a lot would depend on the altitude that these drones are flying over peoples houses . if it is real close , then it could be an invasion of privacy issue . when drones are flying at [[TIME]] , the owners of the drones have to have night permits from the [[ORG]] .
just a [[ORG]] like the cb craze of the [[DATE]]
apparently these are " ufo 's " .
shoot down [[CARDINAL]] , they 'll find out who owns it
it is aliens searching for intelligent life . no luck so far .
shoot them down ... jam ... frequencies ...... do something ....... say something - do nothing does n’t work ........ [[CARDINAL]] ’ drones must be very expensive ......
and remember once [[PRODUCT]] , the [[ORG]] can begin
would it be illegal for property owners to shoot down these drones over their property 's airspace ? do they own the airspace over their property ? if so , up to what altitude is owned ? i 'd be inclined to shoot [[ORDINAL]] , and ask questions later , myself .
if it flies , you must identify ! oj lawyers would be so [[PERSON]] , as would a few religious leaders , and [[ORG]]
right . change the rules because it " irritates " the authorities . brilliant .
spacex satellites are spoiling the sky starlink is a satellite constellation being constructed by [[NORP]] company spacex to provide satellite internet access . the constellation will consist of [[CARDINAL]] of mass - produced small satellites , working in combination with ground transceivers . [[PERSON]] also plans to sell some of the satellites for military , scientific or exploratory purposes .
drone vs. drone . coming soon .
no elvidence of any illegal activity , but let 's pass some new laws anyway .
i know exactly what these things are . no mystery . but i ca n't tell you because i 've been sworn to secrecy by the aliens who abducted me . so sorry .
it ’s dirt cheap to build your own drone and never register it , these laws are always funny .
background check on drone buyers .
of course they want to change something to give them control . and they just do it , with [[CARDINAL]] constitutional authority whatsoever . and they will get no pushback from the people whatsoever other than a few days of whining about it on facebook .
folks keep saying " the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” . flying in groups for over [[DATE]] and failing to answer requests to tell people what is going on lets many believe they are malicious . it is time to announce that unless we are told who is doing this they will shoot down a few to find out .
land of the free , beacuse of the brave . more laws for remote control toys.that should have no laws .
when something is spotted in the air , and no one knows what it is or where it came from ..... it 's the military .
it is open season on any drone that i catch flying around my place . i live in a [[LOC]] , and any drone will be interpreted as an immediate threat against me , my family and my property .
operators for these drones do require to be a licensed ham radio operator , and the drones do need a serial number assigned , or are committing a crime ... this is not hard to figure it out at all ...
sounds like they are able to track them , i m guessing they have a finite range , i m guessing they already know where they are staging from .
shoot [[CARDINAL]] down .
they can be identified with buckshot .
.gov : " omg there 's something we do n't control . quick ! ! ! we must control it ! "
[[CARDINAL]] drones and [[CARDINAL]] remote pilots are registered with the faa simple . register before being able to buy one .
nobody has taken out a few of them with a 12 [[ORG]] yet ?
“ part [[CARDINAL]] prohibits operation of an suas at [[TIME]] , which is defined as the time between the end of evening civil twilight and [[TIME]] civil twilight , as published in [[EVENT]] , converted to local time . ”
i heard that it was against the law to fly drones at [[TIME]] without a flight plan ?
there must be a a way to triangulate the source of the controller .
" we do n't know what is going on , so it is a good excuse to pass sweeping regulations on the [[NORP]] people " that 's what i read ......
i have n’t seen an alleged model type . that would give some info if they could identify via witness .
those drones are a threat to legitimate aircraft flying in the area . they are also a threat to privacy and public safety . where does the [[ORG]] stand on the issue of home defense against these threats ? something needs to be done by government to control this issue . if people shoot them down or use electronic warfare to disable them , that also creates a hazard .
government drones will be flying high and on the spy if you allow the [[NORP]] to continually destroy our country and her laws . socialism and impeachment is the motto of [[ORG]] .
so make another rule or law . only the law abiding citizens suffer from them , criminals pay no attention to any silly law .
or what ?
a couple rifle shots could help id
[[ORG]] , let 's make curiosity a law .
new regulations have already made owning a drone next to useless and now they want more regs . had a nice one that i virtually gave away because it had become almost impossible to legally fly the silly thing . it looks like only those willing to get the very expensive commercial drone certification will be using them in the very near future . ahhh , government .
what would really be helpful would be for the [[ORG]] ( and all other federal agencies as appropriate ) to allow land owners to shoot down these drones if they are flying over their property at a low enough altitude as to be invasive . if they are low enough to be hit with a shotgun or hunting rifle , they are invasive .
seems if these flights were non - threatening and legitimate why would n't the people responsible for it come out and say so to relieve public safety concerns . these flight would take a high level of coordination and big bucks , so do nt think [[DATE]] are behind this . ca n't ignore the potential safety concerns , must get to the bottom of this quickly .
" local sheriffs told the newspaper the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . " “ [[PERSON]] , owner of [[ORG]] , [[CARDINAL]] of only a handful of companies in the nation with [[ORG]] permission to fly multiple small drones at [[TIME]] ”
just another busy day in the life of [[NORP]] scared of some kids flying drones like a motorcycle gang .
government does n't like competition
why ca n't they identify the manufacturer of the drone based on physical appearance and start from there
if it 's over your private property , i 'm all for net guns .
i would think radar or even a private pilot or helicopter could track the location of the origin of the drones - where they are landing .
they do cattle ranching with drones instead of dogs in many places . you can fly drones to locate your cattle and to round them up . drones used for ranching can bark and make other sounds to do this . look it up on [[ORG]] .
scary thought . government flew the drones to worry people so they can change a law with no opposition . this is why some people think mass shootings are scripted so those in gov't can get gun laws passed without opposition .
turning [[GPE]] into another [[GPE]] . do n't understand it ? prohibit it .
maybe it ’s time for those states to put a hefty bounty on drones . we have neighbors that violate our personal space with their picture taking drones . i have often thought of getting my 12 ga . out and shouting pull .
drones are pretty cool and i would n't mind having [[CARDINAL]] if good ones were more affordable . however , i do n't have an issue with some regulations as they can also be used to invade individuals ' privacy . although my daughter is now grown , i would n't want someone using a camera on a drone to take pictures of my daughter . the space around and above folks ' homes should be there own personal space .
these will be real easy to identify when they are laying on the ground in pieces ..... pull !
" local sheriffs told the newspaper the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . " ... but we do n't like it , so we 'll come up with something .
private drone operators , in general , are a lawless bunch . time to regulate drones and stop people being spied upon by pervs .
[[CARDINAL]] report claimed a drone hovered over a town [[TIME]] . sorry , no drone made ( unless military ) could possibly have that kind of battery power . most commercial or hobby drones have a [[CARDINAL]] min battery . to hover all night would take an immense amount of batteries or [[CARDINAL]] every large drone
i think it 's disney surveying land for a new amusement park
[[ORG]] . they 're testing a fleet of delivery drones for range , reliability , and control . they 're doing it at [[TIME]] to minimize the risk of being shot down during [[DATE]] by people freaking out seeing a formation of drones ( it 's working , is n't it ? ) . who else has the money for [[CARDINAL]] 6 - ft drones costing $ [[MONEY]] each , if not the government or government contractors ?
well that solves it ... the drones were the government 's own drones so they could push this new rule !
remember this abbreviation . jamot ... means just a matter of time ... like all things new with technology . if some form of regulatory control is not implemented , where will this new tech phenomenon go . i love [[WORK_OF_ART]] . but i do n't want to walk out behind my barn and relieve myself and have that image posted on you - tube . ( the girls would never leave me alone after that lol ) so yes ... there will be changes coming .
drones are a fire danger . we have to much junk flying around has it is , crashing and killing people . keep drones off private property , unless the property owner gives permission . fly drones on your own property , but if it crashes and starts a wildfire , it will be the operators responsibility .
of course this would only apply to those who choose to comply . [[PERSON]] like gun control .
yep another government law trying to control us .... its probably a group of people like a club or something ....
all these reports and no pictures , what 's up ?
if they are n't breaking laws , leave them alone !
where 's a good emp device when it 's needed .....
i doubt that the [[ORG]] 's give a [[PRODUCT]] about the [[ORG]] rule changes .
maybe this is a false flag op by some group to induce the [[ORG]] to change it 's rules and require id signals from drones . that 's how the environmentalists work with the [[ORG]] to get rule changes they could not get enacted by lawmakers .
its amazing how little people know about things and still feel the need to comment
care to mention those [[CARDINAL]] midwestern states ? co is n't , but [[GPE]] would be . what about the other [[CARDINAL]] states ?
what ! ! ! we missed a way to watch you peons in our move to a police state ! ! ! .. quick , get me a new law . we can not allow people freedom to do what they want without our over - watch … . they are not breaking any laws , so we need a new one that will be broken ... … . sick of this
" ..... and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . " okay so let 's make a law that they are breaking . that way we can make criminals out of non - criminals . sounds like most of the " gun control " laws they pass [[DATE]] .
meanwhile the [[ORG]] will be using [[FAC]] [[TIME]] in [[FAC]] to keep an eye on you .... all hail big brother .
" ranging from the work of a [[NORP]] drug cartel " ya .. i'm sure they will comply with all [[ORG]] . [[ORG]] keep honest people out .
my guess is they are doing something that involves illegal activity .
the drones are searching for the hale bop comet .
above [[QUANTITY]] ? article did n't say ... nice reporting .
i 'm not saying it 's aliens … … but it 's aliens ...
sounds like a set up ! [[ORG]] flew those drones in order to cause enough concern to get the more power through rules . conspiracy theory ? .. maybe .......
sad . [[ORG]] always trying to play catch - up where it comes to technology . too little too late .
it seems to me that bringing one down and investigating it would make identifying the owner rather easy . besides , it 's very likely they will want it back .
they are a potential menace to safety and to privacy , and should be readily identifiable .
and naturally any criminals will not disable any such tracking devices because it would be wrong .
take a drone and follow them . simple and fun .
i believe it 's the area these drones are flying over that has the [[ORG]] concerned and probably more so the [[ORG]] from [[PERSON]] [[ORG]] . that is their flight area , i would say identify or shoot them down , it 's the same reason you do n't want drones flying over [[LOC]] 51 .
no one 's mentioned dr. evil . anybody ?
now define the drones which this impacts . are they stating that commercially produced toys will need this tracking device ? is it only " commercial use " ? are they essentially making home manufacture illegal ? must i include an [[ORG]] certified device in my home constructions ? all too vague . the usual in todays reporting .
“ local sheriffs told the newspaper the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . “ but we are still going to pass a law to identify those who do not break the law .
[[ORDINAL]] off , plausible deniability , hey govt says its not our drones . drone do [[CARDINAL]] thing well , they observe , look for stuff , monitoring . someone is either interested in looking for something , or they are practicing for mass drone warfare attack , something the army would be interested in doing on the battlefield .
[[ORG]] is my guess .
so basically the government namely the [[ORG]] is considering flying multiple drones as contempt of the [[ORG]] even though they are not breaking any laws ? ? ? its time to stop this nonsense interference now
it is n't that difficult to hack a drone . just hack it bring it down and find out where it came from , or shoot it down . go investigate . the police can find killers from [[DATE]] but this one has them baffled .
they were not following the rules before ... suddenly they will because some stiff in a suit made a rule ? ? how long have you had brain damage ? this is " cartel " scouts and delivery system .. the only way to stop it is shoot down a drone and dust it for finger prints or put a chopper up their running thermals and follow it " home " ...
[[ORG]] can easily track [[QUANTITY]] drones . they know exactly where they take off from and land . our officials are keeping us in the dark .
if this is private a private party the are breaking a number of [[ORG]] rules now . they need to do their job a find out what ’s going on not change the rules .
buck shots , kel - tec sg25 .
let 's crack down on drones but leave the borders wide - open . sure , that makes sense ( sarcasm ) .
it 's going to be funny when it turns out it was the government .
" .. there has been no claim of responsibility .. " you can be sure it is criminal activity . probably transporting drugs . criminals do n't care if the [[ORG]] bans drones , restricts their capabilities , or requires identification transponders . criminals do n't obey laws and they wo n't suffer for it .
wow they are saying my kids ca n't fly a kite without a transponder . must be a [[NORP]] [[CARDINAL]] *
probably just the same college kid pranksters that make crop circles .
there are virtually no legitimate uses for drones . outlaw them .
my guess is , the [[PERSON]] are searching for cattle mutilation evidence . since the attacks generally occur at [[TIME]] , the [[PERSON]] are on patrol at [[TIME]] . of course , the [[ORG]] , are way to smart to be busted by these toys .
night time .. they 're probably peeping into bedroom windows . drone cameras are ubiquitous .
if this was a reasonable business activity the business would be saying something about it .
[[ORG]] . its a [[QUANTITY]] plastic . its harmless and none of your business really
delivery service getting ready for the next big push in service ? amazon maybe ?
sounds like an opportunity to get in wing shooting practice with the trusty 12ga .
they fly drones everywhere all the time . some you can hear , some you ca n’t . whoever they are ......
the curious thing here is the article itself . it does n't mention that the drones in question are [[QUANTITY]] long and/or wide , not the little hobby job pictured in the article . whether they are doing anything illegal is another story . if they are flying these large drones over peoples homes or livestock , there is potential for some real harm here .
it 's obviously the [[ORG]] looking for their long lost medulla oblongatas .
“ local sheriffs told the newspaper the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . “ well then what ’s the problem ? ? ? ! ! nothing , so leave them the heii alone ! ! the government does not need to have their nose onto everything people do ! ! 😠
i 'm surprised that some farmers kid has n't shot [[CARDINAL]] out of the air with a shotgun yet
there are important constitutional issues wrapped up in this . as a commercially licensed drone pilot , i am opposed to this big brother intrusion
i really hope the cartels or other bad guys are n't going this for nefarious purposes ... but hard - working , law - abiding citizens should n't be forced to register yet another tool or piece of equipment with the gov't . the government already knows too much about its citizens . [[PERSON]] on the side of privacy .
nothing a [[CARDINAL]] g could n't handle
observed in [[GPE]] , co approximately 10:15pm mst [[TIME]] . the company that is testing their tech will be hit with significant negative press . if their pr firm can handle this i want to see it . several large drones ( [[CARDINAL]] - 6 ’ ) diameter over an extended flight area at [[TIME]] is n’t going unnoticed .
no law is being broken so they are going to make one .
which altitude are they flying at , and how far are they traveling ? they could be agricultural drones inspecting crops , or perhaps they could be doing some sort of mapping . at least , that 's what i would gather .
as much as i hate more freedoms taken away , i do have to agree with the fact that these drones should be registered securely & in a private manner incase their is ever a law breaking incident .
everyone wants to blame the [[GPE]] government for this , but all i have to say is to look at your closest university if you really want to find the culprit .
' local sheriffs told the newspaper the drones do n’t appear to be “ malicious ” and they ’re likely not breaking any laws . ' uh , huh .
i was able to capture one [[DATE]] . there was an ant with a big head flying it , he said he was tired of feeding that fat queen so he got some of the smartest ants in the mound together , crawled into the military base , stole plans from the base and built the drones . he said they come in peace and wo n't build a mound in anyone 's back yard , they are only surveying a new plot of land .
tell 'em to buzz off ....
" flight plans are not required to be filed with the [[ORG]] unless the drone pilots are flying in restricted airspace . " " ... one of only a handful of companies in the nation with [[ORG]] permission to fly multiple small drones at [[TIME]] ... " notice the contradiction here ?
make me a sergeant in charge of the booze !
are n’t these huge drones as well , something like [[CARDINAL]] ft wingspans ?
[[ORG]] should move now . not [[TIME]] .
oh no colorobo !
just shoot them out of the sky . you will find out who the owner is real quick .
no different than cb radios back in [[DATE]] .
i have seen these drones in weld county in [[LOC]] . some of them are larger than store bought drones . i have seen them just hovering over some of the major roads . makes you wonder what the government is up to . this is not private citizens .
this has government written all over it . create a panic and watch the sheep line up and beg the government for more rules , more laws , and more bureaucracy !
slap it to the man > there are over one million full time [[ORG]] 's . many full timers have media channels and wish to share there adventures with others . there are [[CARDINAL]] personnel drones in [[GPE]] . far more then that in all the other countries . there are extremely strict rules for flying a drone in the [[GPE]] . far stricter rules then in any other country . so ? you can have my drone when you shoot it down ! i am just going to build another one [[DATE]] .
they are not malicious . they are not breaking any laws . papers , please .
soon to be call ddd 's drug dealing drones
drugs , drugs , drugs , drugs , drugs . wake up .
no one has followed [[CARDINAL]] home ? limited battery life , especially with the bright lights . they ca n't be going too far .
they 'll be illegal before you know it . some people just ca n't stand others doing what they want .
are there jet powered drones yet ? i ca n't imagine what " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " there will be in [[DATE]] ! i suppose the various ' terrorist ' groups will begin using them to deliver something other than [[ORG]] ...... perhaps someone can invent and sell [[ORG]] ! [[ORG]] will be " stealth drones " !
note that they do n't fly in areas where duck and goose hunting is popular . a couple hi - brass # 6 , 12 gauge shells easily solves the problem .
okay , they 're not endangering anyone . what 's the big deal ?
someone flies a drone under [[QUANTITY]] on my property .. it disappears .
really ? regulate and control drones ; but , let in the illegal aliens . seriously ?
i took a [[ORG]] flying course . it was over my head .
airlines must be freaking out , not too long before one capable of carrying a human is reasonable cost . right now they cost $ [[MONEY]]
[[ORG]] surveillance ; rounding up , political dissidents , gun owners ; encampments ; forced vaccinations for behavioral modification .
good get em out of the sky !
shoot one down and see who comes to claim it .
hmm . i need to look into buying a drone and outfitting it for aerial combat .
did you check the local mosque ? they are training ...
just follow the things they ca n't stay up forever . use another drone or helicopter .
the [[NORP]] will find a way to blame [[ORG]]
probably the [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] are spying using unregulated drones to get the job done .
land of the free needs more agencies to create even more rules and regulations , not .
if the government ( [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , military ) wanted to know [[ORG]] is flying those " drones " , they could triangulate the digital radio signals very easily and close in on the source ! it probably is a government agency doing it ! this is " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " stuff ! the buck rogers author [[PERSON]] predicted this in [[DATE]] - in the novella armageddon 2419 [[GPE]]
[[GPE]] night testing .
probably a [[NORP]] spy surveying targets .
