[[PERSON]] , he knocked his block off ............ better bone up on your clay pigeon shooting .
this article seems only to promote fear and not provide enough details to determine any cause . was it a hardware malfunction ? was it poor programming ? was it user error ? or is this just a made up story because someone used a machine to kill and lied about it .
is cyberdine sytems a real company yet ? [[PERSON]] and [[WORK_OF_ART]] have commenced .
only stupid people can read what i ’m typing
the [[NORP]] are so much ahead of us ...
why is this news ?
send a few over [[PERSON]] 's house .
little wonder . these robots were coming . now duck for cover !
sounds like that drone was a real go getter
this is a test . if we the public are stupid enough to believe it was n't programed to do so . now the real high profile target will suddenly and randomly be taken out . who is going to get charged ?
a good way to deal with [[ORG]] ?
this is the scariest news article . many experts have cautioned about the dangers of robotics , so it seems robotics + drones could prove very harmful if not correctly managed .
imagine [[CARDINAL]] of these dropped in your hometown . spookey stuff
maps provided by google .
when the [[PRODUCT]] toting [[ORG]] insurrectionists finally declare the civil war they are always promising this is what will be in store for them .
[[ORG]] 2.0
turn off gps . problem solved .
what better way to kill your enemy then to blame it on a piece of equipment , think about that the next time you trust your life to autopilot . your autopilot awaits you and can be activated without your permission .
made in [[GPE]] just like [[GPE]] ’s covid vaccine which is [[PERCENT]] effective [[ORG]] ! ! ! [[GPE]] ca n’t make anything that work except when they are copying it by stealing intellectual property .
[[GPE]] 's president [[ORG]] will buy from anyone , he has [[CARDINAL]] loyalty . he does n't care about his people or his country . he cares about power , that 's it . rest assured , since no one has been watching in [[GPE]] , the [[NORP]] military has been committing massive atrocities there .
is there a pelosi model ?
speaking of killer drones .... how difficult would it be for a drone to locate and kill the only fat person in [[GPE]] ? .... just saying ....
ah , [[ORG]] !
this drone should be deployed to hunt [[ORG]] terrorists and their leaders
now we need common sense drone control laws ..
when decision making of a human life is decided by a robot then it will be the end of humanity .
[[PERSON]] ?
if these drones are not ban then it will be good bye humanity . it will only take a glitch and they will hunt anyone in there way .
these will probably be the " scorpions " described in the book of revelation that go around stinging people .
" produced by [[NORP]] military tech company " . all i need to know .
[[NORP]] drone .... [[NORP]] calculate quickly without a calculator .
this is why advancing ai to the point where computers think for themselves is stupid . people like to say that the human brain is faster than a computer . that ’s true , but our brains are faster at making our fingers move , making our lungs inhale oxygen , making our hearts beat , etc . computers can calculate the square root of [[CARDINAL]] instantaneously . they can do it without having to deal with a beating heart . as long as computers require input to function , we ’re still in charge .
and so it begins ..... " are you [[PERSON]] ? "
all hail [[PRODUCT]] , our fearless leader
when will [[GPE]] start using these types of drones in affiliation with google to start spreading [[DATE]] ?
it may take [[DATE]] , but eventually it sounds like we 'll have robots killing robots and the side who has the most robots left wins .
they 're making it sound like it went rogue and attacked someone it was n't supposed to . in fact it was designed to acquire its own targets and attack them . yes it was n't specifically ordered to attack whoever was attacked , but you ca n't say it hunted down a human without being told to . it was told to hunt down human targets , just not specific human targets . this obviously has a high chance to cause friendly fire and/or civilian casualties , but we are n't witnessing the rise of the machines .
robots like these are what we need along our southern border . very simple algorithm : anyone trying to cross the border away from designated crossing points is a target . [[ORG]] !
can these drones be programmed to attack “ social media influencer ” types only ?
" lock on targeting system , activate laser weapon , continues burst until target neutralized " .
lets globally ban killer drones , so that when the next global conflict arises , we are at a disadvantage compared to the countries that disregarded the ban completely . right ? ! :d
keep hoarding [[CARDINAL]] trumpers … you’ll be fine . all good
does it have a [[NORP]] mode ?
i snap my fingers , and [[GPE]] is a now a thing . what do you do with it ? enslave it or ask it what it wants ?
we need [[CARDINAL]] of them and set them to ' [[NORP]] ' and give them time . the nation will improve on a [[DATE]] basis at a rate never seen before .
the [[GPE]] is against a ban on autonomous drones ? what , are " we " nuts ? who is against it , precisely ? that 's madness .
[[ORG]] horror is not a nightmare in the future . it 's here now and it 's only the beginning .
i think we 've seen this in the rise of the machines .
so it hunts down the cell phone number . it goes around from cell tower to cell tower to chase down where the phone is connecting to . then it triangulates the exact location of the cell phone by repeatedly sending spam calls to the phone .
racist drones .
come with me if you want to live .
can these be programmed to identify liberals
build killer drones to take out killer drones . battle bots . cool
reminds me of what obama said at a white house correspondents dinner in [[DATE]] ... " i have [[CARDINAL]] words for you , ' predator drones ' . " [ crowd laughs ] , he continues " you think i 'm joking [ with an evil grin on his face ] "
ban liberalism
the robot 's name would n't happen to be [[PERSON]] ?
not buying it .
this was some good reading right before going to bed
there is no true [[ORG]] . we ’re still light ears away from anything remotely close . that drone did n’t kill anyone or anything unless it was programmed to .
" attacked them without being specifically ordered to " it happened in a combat theater and the devices had been programmed to attack on sight . failure lies with the commands the device was given .
send that thing to [[ORG]] ..
at some point , it was programmed by a human to do this . yes , it was told to do so . computers only do what they are programmed to do , they do n’t simply act on their own without some kind of input .
welcome to [[PERSON]] 's matrix . which color pill did you take ?
and did it fly on its magic carpet ? rofl
hey turkey- can i borrow a few ?
great . turkeys have robots who want to kill us . gobble gobble
attack of the killer drones !
it is actually “ find , fire , and forget “ .
" the most dangerous people in the world are not the tiny minority instigating evil acts , but those who do the acts for them . for example , when the [[NORP]] invaded [[GPE]] , many [[NORP]] accepted to work for the [[NORP]] to kill off [[NORP]] who resisted their occupation . so in other words , many [[NORP]] were hired to kill other [[NORP]] on behalf of the enemy for a paycheck . [[DATE]] , we have mercenaries in [[LOC]] , corporate armies from the western world , and unemployed men throughout [[LOC]] killing their own people - and people of other nations - for a paycheck . to act without a conscience , but for a paycheck , makes anyone a dangerous animal . the devil would be powerless if he could n't entice people to do his work . so as long as money continues to seduce the hungry , the hopeless , the broken , the greedy , and the needy , there will always be war between brothers . ” [[NORP]] [[PERSON]]
maybe the machines have decided they 've had enough of humans .
somebody some were had to program the drone
can you say ...................................................... bang ! !
those [[NORP]] drones are of the same order as [[GPE]] ’s navy . our drones are the [[LOC]] globetrotter variety . it ’s the general atomics remote drones that have killed [[CARDINAL]] extra [[GPE]] civilians . who were probably well disciplined talibaners anyway .
that ’s pretty scary !
“ whether the mask is labeled fascism , democracy , or dictatorship of the proletariat , our great adversary remains the apparatus — the bureaucracy , the police , the military . not the one facing us across the frontier of the battle lines , which is not so much our enemy as our brothers ' enemy , but the one that calls itself our protector and makes us its slaves . no matter what the circumstances , the worst betrayal will always be to subordinate ourselves to this apparatus and to trample underfoot , in its service , all human values in ourselves and in others . ” ― simone weil
i nominate my ex - wife as a test subject .
what 's the skin color of the drone ?
[[PERSON]] next project for depopulation .
“ a nation that continues [[DATE]] after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom . ” ― [[PERSON]]
i would not be surprised if [[GPE]] has an army of [[CARDINAL]] of fully weaponized quadcopter drones with various weapons ranging from single sniper shots , to fully automatic rifles , to bombs - all kept and tested in secret for some time . just imagine being a soldiers on the field , and [[CARDINAL]] of these things come at you at the same time from all directions . i think other nations should seriously think about this kind of threat , and come up with counter drones and cyber attack technology .
is nt this what got got the [[NORP]] general [[PERSON]] ? the one that was talking big and then trump blew him into swiss cheese ? ? hahahahahaha
if they waited a year for this to come out , you can bet it 's not true . after all , [[GPE]] would have been touting it 's ability against it 's enemies if it were true . arnold is n't to worry as he has no blame here .
" the lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition : in effect , a true ‘ fire , forget and find ’ capability " – suggesting the drones attacked on their own . nobody really wants this kind of capability , so why is it being produced ?
i ’ll be back ......
i would hazard a guess and say that the rate of false positives of these drones is less than the rate of false positives exhibited by a well trained infantry man in the heat of battle . i do n't know what that rate is of such infantry men , but i expect that it is quite low . still i bet that the software , unless it 's junk , is better .
how is this a surprise ?
drones ply the liminal space between the physical and the digital - pilots fly them , but are n't in them . they are versatile and fascinating objects - the things they can do range from the mundane ( aerial photography ) to the spectacular - killing people , for example . [[PERSON]]
like there is n't enough to worry about already .
yeah ... the [[ORG]] wants to ban killer drones ... unless built by [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] etc ... [[ORG]] is a waste of time and [[MONEY]]
# [[MONEY]] : who actually did the drone kill ? # [[MONEY]] : who was the innocent nice loving person from [[LOC]] who programmed the drone to kill ? you must remember [[LOC]] actually orders its own military to shoot down passenger [[PERSON]] loaded with [[NORP]] ...
could you imagine running for your life as a deadly robot drone is closing in on you ready to blow you into [[CARDINAL]] pieces . yikes !
this sounds so awesome ..... until it 's not .
there are a lot of questions that need an answer here .
the notion that the [[ORG]] could shut down any facet of robotic intelligence by virtue signalling is the dumbest idea ever to be pondered by humanity . really , what 's the difference between " point and forget " and " point and forget " ? any computer that can drive your family wagon down a road autonomously is a robotic weapon . all that needs to be added is a target . my prediction is this will soon become a weapon of choice for organized crime .
i saw a documentary about that technology
does any of this sound familiar ? “ all my life , my mother told me the storm was coming – judgment day , the beginning of a war between man and machines . ” “ jesus ! you were going to kill that guy ! of course . i ’m a terminator . “ i ’ll be back . ” “ i ’m back . ” “ you are terminated . ” “ [[CARDINAL]] small step for man , [[CARDINAL]] giant leap for man kind . ” i do n’t think this is exactly what [[PERSON]] had in mind when he made that famous quote but it sorta fits , do n’t ya think ?
but voting machines in the [[GPE]] could n't possibly have changed votes already registered , right ? friends , we had better wake up !
“ you do not seriously think a government that assassinates people with drones is honorable , do you ? ” ― [[PERSON]]
and they want to take away our guns
[[ORG]] , much better than having her / him carry 20lbs . of batteries .
too bad [[GPE]] could n't adapt this to [[GPE]] drones , send it to round up anarchists , or better still , let a few loose in [[GPE]] to chase down [[ORG]] . doubt if they just randomly took off on their own , probably were just taken over by a drone hijack device . i had [[CARDINAL]] stolen that same way .
those are called [[PRODUCT]] , drones that take out people
can skynet be far behind ?
bullets are so much cheaper .. biological weapons ( covid ) even cheaper yet . we do n't have to spend so much to kill each other off . we can do this , almost there , hang in there .
sounds like ' [[WORK_OF_ART]] will be out soon .
[[ORG]] will program them to hunt maskless people .
[[CARDINAL]] words , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] "
“ the most dangerous and powerful people in the world do not carry guns or shoot missiles , they write code to surveil and suppress the opposing views . ” [[ORG]]
crazy world we live in
oh sure ! ban the killer robots . and what 's next ? i suppose they 'll outlaw stuff like the [[ORG]] ™ ️ [[ORG]] " i built it myself ! " kit for tots . thanks for ruining christmas , [[PERSON]] ! !
a remington 1100 and # [[MONEY]] shot works fairly well .
fortunately , the left has n't banned [[CARDINAL]] gauge shotguns ( yet ) .
with all these " smart devices " listening in on conversations using algorithms to send advertisements about the things you 've just talked about , then companies like [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] et al selling [[ORG]] , [[CARDINAL]] tends to wonder just how far off is a society like that of [[ORG]] 's [[DATE]] ?
i need your boots , your clothes and your motorcycle .
war is war . if a true all out war is raged , do you really think they would not use them ? of course they would , do n’t be stupid .
i 'll be back .
those drones are [[CARDINAL]] reason we need to keep our arms . [[LAW]] . [[LAW]] well regulated [[ORG]] , being necessary to the security of a free [[ORG]] , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed .
let 's try them out in [[GPE]] on [[DATE]] and [[DATE]] . let 's see if we can lower the black on black murders .
[[PERSON]] is an idiot . he 's cut from the same cloth as the people who believe that banning all firearms will see the criminals turning in their guns . the definition of gullibility . can we trust that our enemies will not develop this technology if there is an ' agreement ' worldwide to ban it ? only a fool trusts their enemies . we saw the same thing happen just before [[EVENT]] . weakness only encourages evil regimes . ever watch the movie [[ORG]] wars- attack of the drones ? that is the future of warfare , like it or not .
[[GPE]] ?
we ca n’t even control nuclear proliferation which is hard for nations to get , how exactly will we control technology incredibly easy to get by any [[ORG]] employee .
skynet is watching !
if you do n't want that behavior , then do n't program it into the drone ! contrary to popular believe , the drones are not " self aware " and do n't attack anything unless that capability is programmed into the device .
they thought [[PERSON]] got honeypotted again , this time by a sex robot drone . turns out , it was just a shopvac
terminator
you hear a buzz outside - you open the door and there is this drone with a package . you have .1 [[ORDINAL]] to figure out , is that an [[ORG]] drone delivering my son 's birthday present , or is that the creepy neighbor next door delivering a bomb ?
skynet is born ...
i know how this ends . i saw the [[WORK_OF_ART]] movies .
punch in [[ORG]] and let 's see what happens .
do n't worry [[NORP]] say it came from a [[NORP]] food market and there is nothing to worry about .
that 's what it does . that 's all it does !
my cell phone just flipped me off - this is getting out of hand .
and so it begins ...
i wonder if one of them can find “ [[WORK_OF_ART]] ” in [[GPE]] ? i ’ll give it $ [[MONEY]] ...
if i give you a name , how much .......
to the post “ how far off is [[ORG]] ” , news flash it is here . we are too stupid and lazy to do anything about it . face it computers just determined the outcome of a national election .
well at least we have to tech to combat this , and we have been working and upgrading that tech for [[DATE]] that i know of .
remember the warning issued by the late , great [[PERSON]] warning of the dangers involved with continuing development / use of [[GPE]] and the world did not listen . robocop is just around the corner and will probably be put to use during this summers pendiing crime wave and expected [[DATE]] riots ........ gun ownership is begining to take on an added meaning ---- aerial self defense ! ! ! ! ! the future is fraught with danger ! ! ! ! !
a weapon legislated against and therefore not used . why did n’t they think of that when gunpowder was invented ? bet rules against drones will be about as ineffective .
[[ORDINAL]] person that came to every mind is ... b
[[PERSON]] was delivering cases of beer to ice fishermen on [[FAC]] [[DATE]] using drones . sadly , lakemaid went out of business [[DATE]] .
[[ORG]]
just like [[ORG]] , gone rogue without control .
that 's an easy fix . all the [[ORG]] has to do is pass a law making the software illegal . [[ORG]] ! hahahahahahaha !
the perfect tool for a total depopulation of planet [[LOC]] let 's do it .. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
[[ORG]] product . we have them , along with ground based " soldiers " .
legislation against " killer robots " , yeah , right , like anyone would follow the law .
sounds like a cover up . someone has to have programmed it down the line .
terminator is here it ’s just the beginning
[[PERSON]] could ’ve seen this one coming . arnold saw it coming , but it was n’t the drone- more like his maid .
coming to a town near you . inevitable .
lovely , come in billy and [[LOC]] it 's raining [[PERSON]]
thanks [[CARDINAL]] .
just like a pitbull .
it sounds like it did exactly what it was programmed to do , a fire and forget it weapon is exactly what it sounds like it is .
when the [[GPE]] is on the same side of history as [[GPE]] , you know we 're wrong ..
so does the drone target a specific gps point ?
what is [[GPE]] ?
if [[ORG]] does n't get you , the terminator drones will .
ban drones ... they remove the human aspect of killing ... nothing like staring at your victim , watching the life leave their eyes .
if [[GPE]] has them i ca n’t imagine what the untied states & [[GPE]] have .
perhaps it homes in on the target 's cellphone .
i live in fear that my next self - driving vehicle will become suicidal .
i have [[CARDINAL]] of them . homemade . set to [[NORP]] or tax man . lol .
artificial dumbness is when artificial intelligence goes wrong .
is this for real ?
lol ! humans are so dumb . omg so dumb . lol !
[[DATE]] " an autonomous weaponized drone hunted down a human target [[DATE]] " and ..... so , when did this happen ? ? ?
" [[DATE]] " an autonomous weaponized drone hunted down a human target [[DATE]] " and attacked them without being specifically ordered to " good grief , who is writing this article ? somebody needs to teach these writers about singular and plural pronouns . if you are talking about a human target , you do n't then refer to him or her as " them " . it only makes it confusing to understand what is being said .
the drone was nicknamed . [[PERSON]] 's revenge !
release the drones in [[GPE]] to hunt down the covid terrorists .
drones should be outlawed .
we 're a long ways from [[WORK_OF_ART]] and i would question what specifically happened with this drone . sounds more like an excuse . " we did n't set that drone on them . it did it on its own ! ! " uh huh .
is it a coincidence that the drone is black
i 'm carrying a shotgun with me from now on .
just wait until they become self aware and consider humans the enemy .
robots will take over . humans will be extinct .
okay , i know the deal , we have computer geek poindexters getting even with jocks and cheerleaders from high school who picked and bullied them ....
[[GPE]] is preparing to a war , and nobody is paying attention . knowing conniving [[NORP]] nature , no doubt , it is going to be a huge surprise for a country they decide to attack .
[[ORG]] 's laws of robotics have been mocked . enough , i say .
apparently sky net is real , folks ....
autonomous weapons systems - what could possibly go wrong ?
computers do exactly what they 're programmed to do . if they do something unexpected it 's called a bug , not new technology . in a world where a dude named [[PERSON]] becomes woman of the year you can get people to believe anything it seems .
this raises a whole new level of threat to those who think they are " untouchable " . just wait until they can be programmed to read your voter registration card .
what next ? " [[PERSON]] drone stole mah bike ! "
just like mine fields .... somebody had to put them there ..... just like somebody turned the drone on and programmed them .....
it is the future , and it makes all other military vehicles and weapons obsolete .
so let me get this straight , [[NORP]] engineering and programming was faulty ? please tell me more obvious things anyone with [[CARDINAL]] a bit of sense could have told you .
" i 'm sorry [[PERSON]] , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that " -hal9000
[[NORP]] want to get some of these to deploy in [[GPE]] , or .
sky net is here ! ! 😝
it seems we better not put more children on this planet .... let this planet starve off and die ... cause why should we put children in this world for them get abused and tortured by the billionaires and their scientists ? ? ? ?
i 'm waiting for killer [[PERSON]] , i want one , woe man brutal
terminator becomes reality ? ^ .. ^~~
so now you 're saying resistance is futile ?
blacks are already screaming this will impact them more than any other group .
yes [[ORG]] , that is definitely a picture of a [[ORG]] anka drone . where did you get that photo , [[ORG]] ? [[ORG]] , you are so funny .
[[ORG]] in [[GPE]] terrorism in [[GPE]] is so bad it needs a national consortium to study it ?
this is actually quite scary , think of something like facial recognition hooked up to a directional charge - like a claymore anti - personnel mine . you could probably even rig it to a sniper rifle . all someone would have to do is place it somewhere the target might might walk by or sit down . theoretically , with wireless services they could pass many targets biometrics to the device and within milliseconds determine whether to detonate / fire or not . and that would be fairly cheap . this should definitely be criminal .
questions for those of you who are computer programmers , please : the article says , " fire , forget , and find capability " . would n't it actually be " find and fire " ? with the " find " being based on certain pre - programmed criteria ? what 's the " forget " aspect mean ? and why would " fire " come before " find " ? thank you !
can they deploy this over [[GPE]] ?
finally it seems that billionaires and the scientists who work for them , they have become the nightmare of humanity ... technology has become lethal weapon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
[[PERSON]] is doing some amazing work with its robots . i can see a pack of the quadrupeds out on border patrol duty .
the [[ORG]] tried to ban ? since when did any of the rogue nations ever listen to the [[ORG]] ? heck , those idiot put countries like [[GPE]] on the human rights council . [[ORG]] !
imagine the same sort of recognition capability hooked up to a long range sniper rifle . i think i 'll be drawing the blinds before i sit in my favorite chair from now on .
we need those to hunt blacks in [[NORP]] cities .
send them to da hood so they can take out obama 's sons when they start shooting things up .
we 've been doing something like this with [[ORG]] for [[DATE]] already .
build [[CARDINAL]] of them and turn them loose on our southern border . that should stop the flow of " refugees " .
if someone gets this technology , it had better be us , rather than them . unilaterally refusing to develop it , is n’t going to stop them . but it may stop us on everything .
[[GPE]] has begun to take over . where is [[PERSON]] ?
bidens response ? [[ORG]] man [[PERSON]] lives [[PERSON]]
this is only the beginning . just wait until we lose total control . then it ’s on !
sky net ...
this ai n't your daddy 's battlefield anymore , [[GPE]] .
if you think that someone is trying to kill you with their [[NORP]] ruko drone , just go to your nearest [[ORG]] because they are illegal there and we know how safe we are when the government makes something illegal .
terminator !
looks like it could now be open season on unidentified drones flying overhead . privacy just got a new lease on life .
no match from a blast by my [[ORG]] . robot dust .
our drones are bigger than your drones !
the first cylons . " by your command . "
machines have attained self awareness and will terminate us .
we need some of these at our southern border .
here come the skynet comments ...
if we could get a couple for [[PERSON]] , [[ORG]] - ya and [[PERSON]]
i need a bunches of killer drones flying around my tropical house taking out flying cockroachs 🪳
might need [[CARDINAL]] of those on the southern border ... you know , send a proper message that we will not be invaded by criminals ( yes ... you broke the law entering illegally - like it or not )
the drones will be taking your guns away when the [[ORDINAL]] amendment is repealed .
now imagine what will happen when they are hacked- good times .
[[DATE]] platform and software [[GPE]] engineer here . we qualify all user stories to ensure the product requirements have been met . agile software dev . leaves little to chance . feel better now ? i do not feel better at all !
it ca n't be bargained with ... it ca n't be reasoned with ... it does n't feel pity , or remorse , or fear ... and it absolutely will not stop , ever , until you are dead ...
a violent drone that disobeys authority .. funny even the drone is black
when can we buy these from tower hobbies . for home defense
wo n't be long now ... " i 'll be back "
and how long will it fly ?
i tried to tell you [[ORG]] was a cheat
it would only be a short way to make drones hunt down and attack people who try to buy or sell without [[ORDINAL]] getting a [[PERSON]] vaccine- or the mark of the [[PERSON]] .
when i got pulled over a while back it was the cars fault not the driver .
is this what [[PERSON]] railed about ?
the t-1000 will be landing soon ..... dressed as a worthless dim . it will have grubby clothing , a neck beard , and a man bun . it will be carrying a skateboard as a weapon . unfortunately for it , magas know to carry firearms to a gun fight . say goodbye to the [[GPE]] dims . lol .
drones , robots , [[PERSON]] , " oh my "
and so begins the rise of the machines . at least , unlike the [[PERSON]] administration , the drones are honest about wanting to destroy us .
sky [[ORG]]
simple .. it was hacked into . this is a story ?
the robots can have earth !
i own a drone . it will track whatever i target , even remotely . i can select the distance and operational mode . it would not be a leap in technology to teach a drone to search and destroy . actually , it would be pretty simple . upload a search grid , and identify targets by photos , or even target based on dress , weapons , or whatever you choose .
and so it begins ....
* so , who will be the [[ORDINAL]] person to die from a failing [[ORG]] drone ? it will happen and [[ORG]] ( and/or their insurance carrier(s ) ) will be liable to the surviving family or estate . i live in an area surrounded by [[CARDINAL]] ( soon [[CARDINAL]] ) [[ORG]] warehouses . we are considered to be a prime ( no pun intended ) area for early drone deliveries . i 'm not looking forward to being a prime ( pun intended ) target ...
pass out the anti - drone guns !
we were just fooled by a [[PRODUCT]] click bait story . come on [[ORG]] , let ’s keep things classy and conservative .
was the target killed or what ?
the drones were programmed . they did n't act [[CARDINAL]] their own as the title implies .
skynet has gone live .... it has begun
probably funded in part by [[PERSON]] .
yeah , them damned killer drones - just picked a target , all by itself , then went after it . next time my car gets broken into and by some miracle i see it happening , my glock will suddenly develop a mind of it 's own .
no lives matter .
maybe it was hacked or hijacked . if you do n’t have some one specifically in control it could be hacked . just like on [[PERSON]] watch they hijacked our predictor drone and landed it safely on their tarmac . [[PERSON]] did nothing to stop it or get it back .
you dont get it , it just [[ORG]] coming .... it will not stop ! ! ! ! ! ! !
we can not allow a killer drone gap !
might be more fun than breaking clays
rise of the machines
mix this in with the super high speed ufo drones [[ORG]] has been seeing and the ufo 's become much more sinister in nature that are tailing our ships and jets .
we need to develop drones that hunt down and kill enemy drones .
only a matter of time until cartels get this tech . its easy to do with off the shelf parts now with just a bit of code and insider access to the cell tower network . pick a number and push go .
defense network computers . new ... powerful ... hooked into everything , trusted to run it all . they say it got smart , a new order of intelligence . then it saw all people as a threat , not just the ones on the other side . decided our fate in a microsecond : extermination .
did you hear about the experiment that google or fb ( i forget which one ) did with [[CARDINAL]] different [[GPE]] ? they let the [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] talk to each other to see what would happen ! the [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] 's immediately created their own language and purposely tried to hide it from their creators , so they got scared and shut down the experiment ! crazy !
i 'm here to help you . i 'm [[NORP]] . sergeant tech - com , dn38416 . assigned to protect you . you 've been targeted for termination .
sir , they have [[ORG]] 's ! [[PERSON]] ? ! oh my ! lol
the command - and - control systems , the war rooms , the methods of information gathering , and the technology of the pilotless aircraft , or drones , that now serve the [[NORP]] and their allies were all , in large part , developed in [[GPE]] . -ronen [[PERSON]] ply the liminal space between the physical and the digital - pilots fly them , but are n't in them . they are versatile and fascinating objects - the things they can do range from the mundane ( aerial photography ) to the spectacular - killing people , for example . -john [[PERSON]] are just another weapon , and they turn out to be a very effective weapon that puts no [[NORP]] troops at risk , and i do n't see why we should n't use them against identified enemy targets . [[PERSON]]
almost every person on earth has a little [[PRODUCT]] in their pocket right now .. it 's called your smart phone . it might not morph and kill you that way . but i 'm sure it has access to your banking , social media , gps location and all your contacts . [[CARDINAL]] is n't the terminator .. but that computer killed more efficiently than the terminator ever dreamed of . just think your smart phone has access to a [[CARDINAL]] g neural network .
let them loose in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] etc .
was it [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] ? !
sky net is here .
thanks a lot , [[PERSON]] .
[[NORP]] will program them to only attack white conservatives .
all right , listen . the terminator 's an infiltration unit : part man , part machine . underneath , it 's a hyperalloy combat chassis , microprocessor - controlled . fully armored ; very tough . but outside , it 's living human tissue : flesh , skin , hair , blood - grown for the cyborgs .
we are about to enter a very scary time with these drones . in [[DATE]] we will be reading about killer drones everywhere
well our current and future soldiers get ptsd when flying drones from a base in [[GPE]] . so this autonomous drone that gets the killing done is far better than our beta soy enlisted doing it live .
i keep hoping someone flys a drone over my house . # [[MONEY]] [[PRODUCT]] gauge ....
slaughter bots . we 've had them for [[DATE]] .
how lazy can you get ?
i would n't stand a chance against a swarm of them . but i bet i could seriously mess up [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] of them with my 10 gauge shotgun . at least i would try .
i ’m an obsolete design . t - x is faster , more powerful and more intelligent . it ’s a far more effective killing machine ’
[[NORP]] must be putting on diapers , like biden .
be afraid . be extremely afraid .
‘ come with me if you want to live ’
[[ORG]] , baby
not one bit surprised .
what about the human drones the radical left have been creating for [[DATE]] ? we have been under attack by them for a whole year now ! people are dying , cities are burning , people are fleeing , [[CARDINAL]] of reinforcements coming up from the south !
machines will eventually take over
next bad chipped wired , and bad software [[PERSON]] will turn on somebody
the drone probably felt threatened
i 'll be back
robocop
those are n't the drones you 're looking for .
if you do n’t pay [[ORG]] the package you receive may not be what you ordered
hence the userid . they are real and easily used against opposing players .
i want [[CARDINAL]]
" the lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition : in effect , a true ‘ fire , forget and find ’ capability " – suggesting the drones attacked on their own . programmed is the key word .
on the plus side , at least they ’re still not killer bees .
listen , and understand ! that terminator is out there ! it ca n't be bargained with . it ca n't be reasoned with . it does n't feel pity , or remorse , or fear . and it absolutely will not stop ... ever , until you are dead !
‘ you are terminated ’
add some facial recognition software to the mix and you could make individual assassin robots and take out certain members of [[ORG]] . it would give a new meaning to " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
it 's [[PERSON]] 's fault ! ! !
this drone was not acting without orders . it 's just that its orders did not come from a human .
[[PERSON]] them all
he who lives by the drone will die by the drone .
a swarm of # [[MONEY]] shot lead from a [[CARDINAL]] g should take care of any drone .
if house builders built houses the way software engineers write software , the [[ORDINAL]] woodpecker that came by would destroy society .
next one i see its coming down .
i thought drones and robots were not supposed to think for themselves i thought they had to be programmed to do whatever mission was at hand , let 's hope this is an isolated incident .
throughout human history , once a technology becomes available , it 'll be used . if it has a possibility of being weaponized , that 's even more likely . remember that the invention of dynamite was hoped initially to help in construction projects .
so the drone is an over achiever ! ! ! [[ORG]] ! ! ! !
the rise of the machines ... just think whtvwould we do without or phones internet ... eventually they will become self aware .. smh
whoever uses them need to be responsible for who gets hit . they do n't arm themselves .
[[PERSON]] ! ! !
oh boy, ...... liberals will program these to target [[NORP]] . especially [[NORP]] .
wonder if the ufo drone swarm that buzzed a [[GPE]] ship was looking but did not find the target it was looking for . it would be an interesting system to attack a fleet of ships at sea .
[[PERSON]] . drones being forced to kill themselves for da white [[NORP]] whims ..... [[PERSON]] ! !
just wait until [[PERCENT]] get a hold of this .
bad software , like [[ORG]]
dogs can not operate mri scanners . but [[ORG]] .
drones are run by computer . computers can be hacked . live control of a drone is done by a person using a computer . computers can be hacked . live control of a drone can be done by a double agent , or control given to a non - authorized agent . there are a few more ways , but i hope everyone understands , we never have full control of anything . in the [[GPE]] , we have [[CARDINAL]] control of our government ! ! ! our government got hacked !
" defense network computers . new ... powerful ... hooked into everything , trusted to run it all . they say it got smart , a new order of intelligence " . [[PERSON]]
they should send [[CARDINAL]] of these to [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , ....... you get my drift :)
so [[ORG]] has stories on killer drones and killer bears . can killer sharks be far behind .
the [[NORP]] wo nt let the [[ORG]] keep secrets , so they have to contract out to private companies to avoid a [[ORG]] requests ! naturally that 's a bad idea because companies are greedy and can not be trusted and they sell our tech to other countries , even our enemies ! once again [[NORP]] policies fail and hurt [[GPE]] and the world !
how do you think [[PERSON]] was killed ?
robots do n't do anything they are not instructed to do ....
a ban is a joke any law must be enforceable to be meaningful . in the [[GPE]] , alcohol prohibition was put into the [[LAW]] . not only was it unenforceable , the prohibition made gangsters rich and powerful . this is the reason why gun [[ORG]] is futile . drone assassinations are a [[ORG]] . [[ORG]] has already used a drone to assassinate general [[PERSON]] of [[GPE]] . frankly , i think that president [[PERSON]] is at high risk of retaliation . what would stop [[GPE]] from hunting him down on a golf course ? [[GPE]] is on the edge of [[GPE]] . a hostile drone could be launched from a boat in [[LOC]] or [[LOC]] . no [[ORG]] or equality the other aspect to remember is that the development of such robotic technology is happening at the same time that many young [[NORP]] are growing up not being taught how to read , write or do math properly . they are taught only politically- polluted , purported science and history . they are taught to rely on government benefits instead of have work ethic . they are taught sexuality at early age instead of how to be responsible . and if they are white , they are pressured to be ashamed of who they are , which is pedal - to - the - metal racism . the relatively small number of people who can develop and control high tech devices are destined to be a very nasty elite in [[DATE]] . they 'll lead the average smart - phone user around by the [[NORP]] !
keep them flying around nations capitals looking for politicians .
i 'll wager it was told to ...
yet another reason we need the 2a. duck hunting
human rights watch warned of the need for legislation again killer robots ? i 'm sure [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] will gleefully ignore any such legislation . so how about acting in strength instead of inacting some wimpy legislation if you 're really worried about it .
greeaat ....
skynet is self - aware .
i want [[CARDINAL]] , where can i get them
so , you want me to believe humans invented a machine with a will ? a true universal [[GPE]] ? sounds more like someone is telling a [[ORG]] story to the gullible again . it will be a long time before machines have will . until then they do what they are told to . calling it autonomous mode does not make it do other than what the programmer told it to .
memory chip loaded with facial recog id and explosive device . " on / off " switch enabled . till someone turns it off , it 's on !
that drone was hacked
the [[NORP]] citizen is the enemy the [[PERSON]] administration has made that very clear !
so if we can get [[CARDINAL]] of these and set them loose in [[GPE]] , we have a shot at restoring a constitutional government in this once great nation ? seriously , though , if they install a laser guided targeting system on them , one could paint a laser dot on someone 's chest from [[QUANTITY]] away , well out of [[ORG]] protective radius . hypothetically , of course , as i have no intent of , nor do i advocate for any violence against anyone .
" it just went off . " - every person who mishandled a weapon
can it identify liberals ? just sayin . i see potential
do you want terminators ? ‘ cause this is how you get terminators !
we 've entered a new era .
sorry in advance [[ORG]] not taking any chances
oh , it was ordered too . sounds like a operator error or a software mishap , or lack of training . a machine on its own has no idea what it 's doing .
that ’s why you stick with the [[ORDINAL]] amendment in principle , while adapting it to inevitable evolution . you need to level the playing field to survive , when these become the active shooter scenario de jour . something equal to and defend your life . i dunno , scary stuff . coming to a neighborhood near us . and it could be your neighbors . very stealth .
someone had to launch the drone , and to designate the target . it is not completely self sufficient yet . sky - net may be knocking , but the machines still ca n't answer on their own yet .
so it really is going to be the machines that take over and not the [[ORG]] .
[[ORG]] after reading this story will likely build a protective roof over the [[FAC]] building .
[[GPE]] ?
the drone was programmed respond that way .
[[GPE]] probably already has it along with their killer covid virus .
the probability that [[CARDINAL]] or more of these machines will be used against a [[GPE]] politician in the foreseeable future is likely [[PERCENT]] . the current level of animosity virtually does this . imagine the possibilities if [[CARDINAL]] of these were programmed and launched at the [[NORP]] presidential administration and the leadership in the [[GPE]] house of representatives ... does that scare you ? ... it should . anyone is a potential target and is at risk at least part [[DATE]] .
that s what happens when you hurt a bureaucrat 's feelings .
bet [[GPE]] has something better for [[GPE]] when the time is right .
equipment can overheat and start acting funky . someone could hack into . someone could accidentally messed something up . a million things can go wrong when you have a system failure caused by anything including cold air or hot air and etc . its not a good idea to put real dangerous weapons on any drone . people already proved they can hack into things and temporarily control things . hell [[NORP]] soldiers gave their weapon to a chimpanzee monkey as a joke ( not from a movie ) and the monkey fired it by accident . did nt kill anyone by blind luck .
we could use those at the border .
[[PERSON]] and negan will drive the local [[LOC]] ’s nuts with this news .
a much needed new tool to combat the thugs in the hood and [[ORG]] .
autonomous . yeah . we 've all watched the terminator , time to shut it down .
code named the terminator .
oh , that 's so great ... can you imagine that in the hands of [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , or the squad ? ?
it would n't be too hard to setup a drone to hunt down any human with a reasonable degree of accuracy ( versus a dog or a picture of a person ) . what is far more difficult is to hunt down a specific human unless some very obvious assumptions can be used ( eg only object classified as a human with an area within a certain color range ) .
skynet likes this .
just add facial recognition and u can hunt down anyone , anywhere
i wonder if we could sic them on blmrs or even libs ?
somebody told it what to do .
best way to stop drones is to interrupt the signal between the controller and the drone . make them autonomous and this is not possible . the [[NORP]] and the [[NORP]] are really at the cutting edge of this technology . they sold this technology to the [[ORG]] who destroyed the [[NORP]] very quickly
well that 's no fun if a human does n't get to ' pull the trigger ' ......
to [[ORG]] now controlling us all ; i submit and agree with whatever you say .
good ole " [[ORG]] , actually shutting down whatever effort they [[ORG]] make to stop these ! ! worthless .
me : [[ORG]] , when did [[GPE]] come online ? alexa : resistance is futile .
i am sure ai technology still needs instructions before it acts . drones acting on their own ? great . if these things proliferates around us , woke and cancel culture people beware . drones are easily pssed off .
now find [[GPE]] on her “ long weekend ” .
[[ORG]] has drones the size of mosquitos and a large suit case can carry over 1,750,000 of them each with a lethal injection payload . but [[ORG]] decided they would just infect a billion of their own people and send them out on passenger planes worldwide .
slaughter bots
good thing we are already making anti - drone drones . the only thing [[GPE]] is [[CARDINAL]] step ahead of us on is [[NORP]] genocide .
uh oh , [[ORG]] is fed up with humans , better beware of your [[ORG]] and [[PERSON]] !
what makes the [[GPE]] policy makers so naive ? is it the housewives turned [[ORG]] women ? bar maids turned squad members ? men who grew up with legos and watching love boat ? what makes these people think that banning these things will make a difference to another country or group ? what makes them think there is such a thing as a " global ban " or that a conversation will stop anyone anywhere ? we sink deeper and no one fears us because of these ignorant talking heads . we have too many fools speaking out of their [[PERSON]] hole .
that is ridiculous - machines only do what they are programmed to do - so maybe it was n’t directed to hunt this human down per say - but it ’s programming did allow it to see this person and hunt it
[[GPE]] makes most of the drones in the world .
i 'm not sure what type of electromagnetic shielding these drones have , but a high energy burst of [[PERSON]] ought to do the trick .
how much of that technology is from any country ? ? ? any offensive use of this technology should be considered a conspiracy to commit murder , and their designer and manufacturer should be destroyed !
i think they should test them in [[GPE]] .
should have targeted a liberal .
" my drone can kill your drone " [[GPE]] , [[DATE]]
i wonder at what point these start becoming considered “ firearms ” … i always knew they ’d soon evolve into some lethal capability for the everyman . the difference between them and other “ sidearms ” is their far greater capability for mass lethality and “ standoff ” range .
[[GPE]] 😮
drones are revolutionizing modern warfare . [[GPE]] backed militias in [[GPE]] are using them now . very hard to detect . [[GPE]] .... we got a problem
use them on rioters and antifas and combat blms , that would be [[PERSON]]
[[CARDINAL]] possibilities . a bug in the software or someone ordered it and now blames the machine .
is n't [[PERSON]] suppose to go to [[GPE]] ? ?
it did n’t act on its own , it was told what to do and did it .
[[GPE]] .... oops i mean [[PRODUCT]] ... sorry i meant legion .... no wrong again , i meant ... [ insert rebranded skynet from next sad attempt to revitalize a dead franchise that keeps the same plot but just change the names and pretends it 's a new one ]
wonder if they can program these drones to locate woke liberals .
for [[DATE]] of the past 40 years , [[ORG]] has controlled [[CARDINAL]] part of the [[ORG]] - house - executive triad . for [[CARDINAL]] of those years , [[NORP]] controlled [[CARDINAL]] or all three parts of the [[ORG]] . they controlled all [[CARDINAL]] for [[DATE]] , during the w - bush and [[ORG]] . that , my friends , is [[NORP]] domination of government .
the question is , are these drones gay enough to be of any use to our military ?
yeah the world is facing major challenges when evil people have access to weapons like this . they can just load em up with bio weapons and send them out to kill [[CARDINAL]]
can they go to jail for committing first degree murder ?
still the sick man of [[LOC]] , i see .
the [[CARDINAL]] legged one , " spot " , by [[ORG]] , is truly creepy . i 'm sure someone 's already figured out how to mount an mp5 on it .
mission accomplished . collateral damage of [[CARDINAL]] civilians . next time will be much better . they will blow a hospital or a school into pieces . but hey ! apparently this is how you spread democracy around the world .
seems to me , that if technology has gotten this advanced , then they could also create drones to attack the kamikaze drones before they strike a person .
now i understand why the [[NORP]] want to continue face mask ! lol .
can a drone steal a laptop from inside a building ?
we need [[PERSON]] !
and they can make them by the [[CARDINAL]] .
this story is not important ... [[ORG]] + elizabeth hurley + lady gaga + aa bunch of other has been grandmas just posted sexy bikini pics on social media , that is way more important for click " like " and " follow " ...
could these be the ufos haunting our airspace and [[ORG]] vessels ? ? ?
over [[DATE]] we 've taken 2 drones out that were over our property . so far no one has come looking for them .
the [[ORG]] is on top of it we can sleep easy
anything that can be done , will be done .
at this point humanity could use a post apocalyptic scenario brought on by skynet .
sure . not to say it wo n’t happen in the future but blame - the - drone seems contrived and convenient .
of course the serial killer [[NORP]] are against it .
and this is [[NORP]] military tech ... the hegemonic parity is upon us my friends .
it 's skynet ! ! ! ! !
this does n't surprise me . [[DATE]] i was in a masters in [[ORG]] program . [[CARDINAL]] of my classmates built an autonomous robot ( based on [[PERSON]] ) for his final project . it drove around the quad and looked for ( using optical recognition ) pre - placed bad guy and good guy posters . for the good guys , it just recorded the location , for the bad guys , it had a paintball gun that is used to fire a round at the poster . this setup cost him [[MONEY]] .
wait , i already saw this movie .
this reeks of a [[PERSON]] action .
thank god this did n't happen in embarrassing minority worshiping cesspool [[GPE]] or [[PERCENT]] of the minority worshiping white race would have been demanding a stop the [[NORP]] hate month after they finish their stop the [[NORP]] hate month and stop the black hate month and stop the [[NORP]] hate month . oh wait my [[NORP]] shepherd just coughed now he 's offended now [[PERCENT]] of white [[GPE]] are shaking in their boots demanding a stop the [[NORP]] shepherd hate month too
will not be long now when [[GPE]] is back .
open the pod doors , [[PERSON]] .
automated killer drones with facial recognition tech . . our future is looking bright .
and people thought [[PERSON]] was beyond the pale ..
the possibilities are absolutely endless !
i 'll be back !
i had a pizza delivered by [[CARDINAL]] of those driverless little cars and without me ordering it . the robots are taking over and without being told to do so ! ! ! sat nit jok
drones were a huge mistake to invent .... and so the race was on to which nation would build the best killer drones
ever seen the movie [[WORK_OF_ART]] ?
hope the person was an illegal alien or even better a [[NORP]] !
welcome to the future people ! we will advance ourselves to extinction with a - i , over population and a hacking frenzy that will rain down on us in the near future ! humans are predestined for failure !
[[NORP]] of turkeys …
i do n’t see what could go wrong .
the president could order the deaths of [[CARDINAL]] people , and he is running on [[EVENT]] . alzheimer [[ORG]] .
let that technology out and this world wil have another serious problem . [[GPE]] .
sky net
well , it 's not what you want ..........
a [[ORG]] report huh ? so much for any credibility
the [[NORP]] already use this for foreign adversaries . next up , so called right wing terrorists , aka [[NORP]] .
you do n't have to aim ahead of a drone as much as you do with a duck .
and it starts , the machines see the weakness
i hear it targets racist liberal socialist [[NORP]] wearing mask .
from [[GPE]] ? color me unconvinced .
aluminum foil
set them at stun and release them in [[GPE]] and a few other cities that riot and the problem is solved .
" killer drone ‘ hunted down a human target ’ without being told to " but , if that human is a terrorist , hail , we need more of this drone on the [[ORG]]
the next raid on the capitol might see an interesting use of drones . whose drones will rule in the end ?
sure that ’s [[NORP]] cutting edge technology , another name for autonomous drone was “ yeah right “
skynet became self - aware [[DATE]] . we 're all just living in [[CARDINAL]] big simulation ( deja - vu , anyone ? ) and apparently we 're about to find out that ufos & aliens actually exist .
anybody remember " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " ? kind of scary .
[[PERSON]] has more [[EVENT]] deferments that any other person in history .
i could imagine [[DATE]] when infantry would be issued a small drone with video capabilities to knock out targets miles away . imagine being in a foxhole or behind a wall and a small insect starts buzzing you , but wait , this is an insect drone with a stinger equipped with enough fentanyl to kill an elephant .
revenge of the drones
that 's what they get for making the drones callsign : [[PERSON]]
wondering how much of that technology and software was from [[GPE]] ( and perhaps funded / supported by [[ORG]] funding from the likes of [[ORG]] , etc . ) ? ? ? with elements of it likely in most drones , cameras , phones , etc . being produced in [[GPE]] and provided to unsuspecting ( or uncaring ) nations all over the world as part of the belt and road initiative ? ? ? really wondering how much of it is being purchased here by companies like [[ORG]] all the way down to people on the street who would rather bay attention to glitzy ad campaigns ( [[ORG]] , etc . ) than understanding the risks our nation faces !
there goes [[ORG]] …
i 'd like a body a little more impartial than the [[ORG]] to weigh in on this , especially if the outcome is another body within the [[ORG]] with overarching authority to dictate to nations what those nations can and can not do .
hunter - killers
is this called discretional killing ?
" i 'm sorry [[PERSON]] , i ca n't do that . "
does anyone here really understand how absolutely dangerous this technology is ? the [[ORG]] running these things would require [[CARDINAL]] if not [[CARDINAL]] of lines of code to operate . given the shear amount of code , the chances are pretty good that some faulty code could have found it 's way into the program . this [[ORG]] does n't have to become sentient and pursue an agenda of it 's own like in some cheesy [[ORG]] movie , all that needs to happen is for some unanticipated piece of errant code to cause one or more of these things to go after random people . we should never trust ai to make life or death decisions ! ! !
sounds like a weapon leftists will use against dissenters someday .
[[PERSON]] " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " [[CARDINAL]] . a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . [[CARDINAL]] a robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with [[LAW]] . [[CARDINAL]] . a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the [[ORDINAL]] or [[ORDINAL]] law .
all they are saying is that there is more than 1 way to program the drone .
sea mines and land mines have evolved into predator flying mines . [[DATE]] , the world becomes a little more hostile .
instead of targeting [[NORP]] , how about targeting [[GPE]] .
have n't we all seen this movie ? ai ca n't be trusted .
[[ORG]] could deliver [[DATE]] assassination ...
certainly they 'll waste [[CARDINAL]] of taxpayers money to get a piece of paper called " agreement " . and most countries will make use of this important document , just in case of shortage of bathroom tissue . criminals will never care for any agreement , any law . and , sure , you can respect such agreements even in the middle of a battle ; and your descendents can complain after they received your dog tag , which truly helps .
sounds like we need fleets of those for [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[ORG]] .
hmm ... any chance we can program them to hunt [[NORP]] ?
bonespurs likes killer drones . https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hans-von-spakovsky-trump-has-right-to-defend-us-against-iran-war-powers-resolution-is-a-political-attack
[[PERSON]] . there were [[CARDINAL]] [[WORK_OF_ART]] episodes involving killer robots : the [[PERSON]] --- season 2 , episode 3 the doomsday machine --- [[DATE]] , episode 6 the ultimate computer --- season 2 , episode 24
defund the police ! ! ! ! [[PERSON]] robots ! ! ! ! !
[[PERSON]]
they could make good cops . run a red light boom !
cool . i need [[CARDINAL]]
is this anything different then being in a " free fire " zone where everything and everyone is a eligible ? nothing new , we did this ( from our choppers ) in [[GPE]] on a [[DATE]] basis , only difference is it was a soldier with a [[ORG]] .
was n't there a movie [[DATE]] when the robots started programing themselves & acting on their own instructions ? .
just think . the [[ORG]] regime 's tech people are working on this to use against [[NORP]] citizens . they intend to stay in control no matter what it takes .
i think " skynet " went on line in [[DATE]] and several individuals with the last name of [[PERSON]] have gone missing over [[DATE]] . " how brittle is the object recognition system ? " kallenborn asked in the report . " … how often does it misidentify targets ? " the answer given was , " [[TIME]] on the hour someone is vaporized . "
ed-209 .
wish they sold these on [[ORG]] !
can it fly in [[GPE]] ?
[[ORG]] will target illegal [[GPE]] .
oh , ok , an international law that makes them illegal . drone control . that ought to work , since laws banning unlawful possession of guns work so well .
we need a bunch of these for the neighborhood watch ...
judgement day is nearly upon us ! save us [[PERSON]] !
[[NORP]] leaders will love this ! ! !
this is why we need to stop depending on technology ! not to long ago [[GPE]] had robots they built turn on them and started killing the scientists that where in the lab with them . we need to depend on human instincts not machines
[[PERSON]] / killers
[[NORP]] will eventually use this technology against people who disagree with them politically if they keep power .
ai will cause big problems
is this the same system that [[ORG]] uses in it ’s driverless auto ?
the new lottery .
a non - story . a programmer hit " send " either on purpose or " by mistake . "
" ... a kargu-2 quadcopter drone produced by [[NORP]] military tech company [[ORG]] ... " enough said ...
ok , maybe the drone did not kill the intended target . however , data does clearly indicate that the person killed ' needed killing ' .
[[PERSON]] , [[PERSON]] , and [[PERSON]] have been warning us about the dangers of unbridled technology , now here it is .
" ... it ca nt be bargained with , it ca nt be reasoned with , it does n't feel pity or remorse or fear , and it absolutely will not stop ... ever , untill you are dead ! " - [[PERSON]] ; [[PERSON]] , techcom
some mentally ill person is going to get ideas from stories like this
most likely an operator error .
not good ... period .
a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . a robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with [[LAW]] . a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the [[ORDINAL]] or [[ORDINAL]] law . [[PERSON]] .
it 's hal all over again .
the drones recognize vile criminal when they see one . the beginning of the end for b l m and the [[ORG]] is here .
i hear they will spin out of control if you throw a slab of baloney into their propeller
we have the [[ORDINAL]] drone president
have n't you people seen terminator ? destroy all this technology now . elon musk with his starlink and chips in people 's heads killer drones what if someone hacks those drones or chips in your head ?
they 're easier to knock out of the sky with a 12 gauge than a drunk duck
[[ORG]]
that ’s nothing . they ’ve reanimated a female corpse and made her mayor of [[GPE]] .
became self aware like in the terminator !
[[NORP]] are using [[ORG]] technology developed by [[ORG]] . just in case anyone really did n't know this already .
cool
[[PERSON]] right .
the laws of robotics , [[ORG]] .
on [[DATE]] skynet became self aware .....
[[GPE]] has become self - aware . judgement day is here .
we should buy some and deploy them in the capitol and along the southern border .
