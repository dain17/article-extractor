Not only was it unenforceable, the prohibition made gangsters rich and powerful.  This is the reason why Gun Control is futile.\n\nDrone assassinations are a REALITY.  The U.S. Government has already used a drone to assassinate General Soleimani of Iran.  Frankly, I think that President Trump is at high risk of retaliation.  What would stop Iran from hunting him down on a golf course?  Florida is on the edge of the United States.  A hostile drone could be launched from a boat in the Gulf Of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean.  \n\nNO EQUITY OR EQUALITY\n\nThe other aspect to remember is that the development of such robotic technology is happening at the same time that many young Americans are growing up NOT being taught how to read, write or do math properly.  They are taught only politically- polluted, purported science and history.  They are taught to rely on government benefits instead of have work ethic.  They are taught sexuality at early age instead of how to be responsible.  And if they are White, they are pressured to be ashamed of who they are, which is Pedal-To-The-Metal Racism.\n\nThe relatively small number of people who can develop and control high tech devices are destined to be a VERY NASTY ELITE in coming decades.

So in other words, many Indians were hired to kill other Indians on behalf of the enemy for a paycheck. Today, we have mercenaries in Africa, corporate armies from the western world, and unemployed men throughout the Middle East killing their own people - and people of other nations - for a paycheck. To act without a conscience, but for a paycheck, makes anyone a dangerous animal. The devil would be powerless if he couldn't entice people to do his work.
