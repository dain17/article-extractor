everything in the ocean makes its living with its teeth .
after [[DATE]] this is the best article you have ? ? ?
that does n't look like a white shark
do n't become part of the food chain .
looks like a whitetip , not a great white as suggested in the pic with the article .
[[ORG]] sharks matter
what do we not know about these beasts , that we keep running into them . how many times do we have to watch [[DATE]] , before there is a new episode . it 's been [[DATE]] already .
shark week is a tradition like watching all of the godfather films and lord of the [[ORG]] .
yes , like this .
god , terrifying .
too bad it was n't [[PERSON]] on the surf board .
when you 're wearing black you might as tell a shark " hey look at me , i 'm a seal ! " if i ever get in shark - infested waters , i 'm wearing yellow .
this guy was 1 second from some real pain . that fish surfaced and they do n't do that unless they mean to eat ! you are [[CARDINAL]] lucky dude ...
i think it ’s nose hit his board cord and decided this was not food .
dude .
[[NORP]] scarey - i 'd never go back and tempt fate . no drone can snatch you from a shark attack but thank goodness the drone was there or the surfer would n't be .
surfers paddling look like sharks ' preys : seals , turtles ...
not necessary to have cafeteria selections for sharks .
they should have used the theme from [[ORG]] .
[[PERSON]] shark do - do - do - do - dooooo , [[PERSON]] shark do - do - do - do - dooooo , [[PERSON]] shark do - do - do - do - dooooo , [[PERSON]] shark do - do - do - do - dooooo .
[[ORG]] !
close [[CARDINAL]] , obviously shark decided humans not worth biting .
" you go in the water , sharks in the water . " -quint
baby shark na [[ORG]] nana .....
that 's not an adult shark .
i always love when people say sharks are n’t dangerous , yet shut down beaches when one is spotted .
that shark shook it 's head like he smelt something worse then fish !
when was the last time this kid washed his feet !
[[GPE]] teacher goes viral with tearful video about pressures of online teaching : ' i am at my breaking point ' [[PERSON]] . this topic is more important to comment on . what is wrong with you people , your website .
that 's not a great white , heck it 's not even a great shark . i have an aquarium with fish larger than that . and what kind of surfing are you doing with no tide ?
i 'm guessing he had to change his wet suit .
that shark is obviously a biden voter . what a coward .
gooey on the outside , crunchy on the inside
i would have cast the [[PERSON]] spell ( my f4 key ) on the shark twice , followed by a paralyze ( f7 ) , then finished it with a earthquake spell ( [[ORG]] ) . the only problem with earthquake spell is it only works [[PERCENT]] of the time . so if i failed , i would be in trouble because my mana would be really low . so i would keep hitting it with lightning spell ( f1 ) and drink a regeneration potion because i would probably be really tired . i do n't mess around , and i am not afraid of sharks . the only problem , as i see it , is it 's really hard to carry a spell book with me at the same time i am pretending to be a seal .
you are so right , shark - food wannabes can get into serious trouble .
this whole pandemic quarantine thing is getting to ya bro ... you need a vacation .
no . i am an avid shark guy
[[PERSON]] you got touched by an angel from watching the video
[[CARDINAL]] shark attacks in [[DATE]] , i guess this is [[PERSON]] fault too ?
amazing what technology can do [[DATE]] . [[PERSON]] and beach goes are safe because of it .
i have a drone and love it ... have flown it off shore and have seen many sharks .
awe , go surf off of [[LOC]] where the [[ORG]] sharks are n't as fast ..
that surfer must be a leftist . the stench drove the shark away .
maybe he will give up pro surfing and become a pro worker .
too close for comfort - i 'm still afraid to go back in the water . :-o
never get out of the boat ... my bad , wrong movie ...
white privilege
i 'm guessing he had to change his wet suit .
when you get in the water you 're on the menu .
yup ... i never have that problem at the swim - up - bar at the resorts ! ! !
amazing how fast a giant creature like that moves through the water . we all know its like slow motion for us moving through water . when they hit , its like a ton of bricks .
the shark seemed to realize he was n't a seal and broke off .
when you say in the headline , “ caught on video ” , you lead the reader to believe you have the video of it . but there was no video . do not like misleading headlines .
foot odor issue ?
on a board with your hands out i feel you must look like a fish to them .
that is sick scary .
smart shark figured the surfer was n't a seal .
i 'm writing to " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " and ask her if i am making a mountain out of a mole hill because my wife is encouraging me to take up surfing !
if that shark wanted to bite the surfer , he would have .... but the surfer was n’t on the menu .
the shark did the same thing [[PERSON]] does when she realizes that she 's accidentally in the salad bar line at a buffet , abort mission .
good thing the surfer was n't wearing his lucky ham .
# [[GPE]]
when you insert yourself into the food chain you may be eaten .
too small to be a great white .
time to take up a new sport , like longboarding . no sharks on land
every time a surf board comes off the assembly line ... it mocks [[PERSON]] .
sharks are ornery because they have all those teeth and no toothbrush .
looks like the surfer had just crop dusted the area and [[PERSON]] wanted nothing to do with it .
wow the price you have to pay for good surf ! ! ! !
someone 's got a good guardian angel ...
glad the great white did n't go " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " on him . phew ....
people do n't believe it ? but this is [[CARDINAL]] story out of not many that does have a happy ending . me and some friends of mine surfed in [[DATE]] after [[PERSON]] on [[GPE]] , like idiots . anyway , unexplainably my buddy felt a hard hit on his board just to have it break in [[CARDINAL]] . to this day we think it was shark . [[CARDINAL]] sandbars here . paddle out to the [[ORDINAL]] ? you can see them from the air . [[PERSON]] pushed them in between the [[ORDINAL]] and the [[ORDINAL]] . sold my board . i 'm good .
whatever , i see sharks all the time paddle boarding , surfing and spread fishing where i live . if you go to a restaurant , you see people . if you go in the forest , you see bears . this is n’t really all that uncommon . heck i saw approximately 8 ft tiger [[DATE]] kayaking .
i 've had sharks nudge my board . scary stuff . does n't un pucker for [[TIME]] . lol
prejudiced against sharks and fish profiling . [[PERSON]] was just wading in warm water . [[ORG]] have privilege
it looked relatively small considering how big they can get .
the shark checked him out to see if he was edible .... decide no way and left in a hurry ...
that 's it ! i will never go surfing with a drone hovering above me and ominous music playing in the background ever again !
# sharklivesmatter
board goes in the water .. you go on the board .... sharks in the water .... our shark ...... farewell and adue to you fair spanish ladies .....
we 're gon na need a bigger surfboard .
meatstick on a shingle .
eh , just checking the dude out . the shark would have easily hd a snack if it wanted .
that looks less like a great white and more like a fair / okay white shark . glad he did n’t get hurt non the less .
talk about danger close ! ! ! [[PERSON]] that island { [[GPE]] } like they own it ! ! ! always a risk in those waters ! ! ! that [[PERSON]] 's wife said wait a few days before going back in . not exactly sound logic since more will circle around by then ! ! !
i understand that great white shark size is an important factor in attacking humans . [[CARDINAL]] ft will probably leave a [[CARDINAL]] ft human alone . however one that is above [[CARDINAL]] ft is more probable to attack . maybe the surfboard might have increased the apparent size and kept it from an explaratory bite .
i think ..... those [[NORP]] waters are not that clean and pretty . could not see a thing ;
[[NORP]] up dude !
[[PERSON]] has a pet great white shark that he rides up and the coast on .
another guy disguised as shark food playing where sharks live .
that s not a great white but heck why be less dramatic
sharks have been traced back over [[DATE]] . they have [[ORDINAL]] dibs in the ocean .
he can count [[DATE]] [[DATE]] of his life .
that 's a big rappala ---said the shark .
let 's see , surfing in shark infested water . here 's your sign .....
you 're swimming around defenseless in his dining room . at least i can carry a gun if i 'm out where bears , mountain lions or other land - based predators might be .
never get out of the boat . chef in apocalypse now .
not unless you 're going to take it all the way .
seemed to sniff his feet and veered off !
i thought science keeps telling me that attacks are accidental . we 're not a food source . nothing to worry about .
he went in shore and changed his shorts
was there supposed to be video ?
so the shark swam up , checked him out and left . and ? ?
just goes to show you - when are out on the water and the thought of a shark crosses your mind - they are always there , even though we may not know it ! ! ! !
how would they know it was safe . its the ocean and that where sharks live . believe it or not , sometimes said sharks maybe deep down in the ocean .
did you know there 's a taste test to find out if there 's sharks ? if the water is ' salty ' there 's sharks .
your forgetting [[ORG]] sharks , probably the most dangerous shark of all . they have been known to travel up [[LOC]] as far as [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[QUANTITY]] .
not many surfers in the [[GPE]] at [[ORG]] though .
depends on the flood level of the river , and do n't forget [[ORG]] is where the ol' [[PERSON]] converges so there could be some great surfing .
[[PERSON]] would be safe , nobody likes her .
more likely it would n't bite out of professional courtesy .
if a shark ever did bite cankles it would die from formaldehyde poisoning ....
now , now , do n't be mean to the poor innocent shark !
[[ORG]] , looks like a guppy
definitely not a landshark
luckily it was a small one .
how long does it take to clean up the water after a shark gets that close ?
people go from top of the food chain to the bottom of it when they enter the ocean .
" not like going down to the pond and chasing bluegills and tommycods . this shark , swallow ya whole ... "
i 'm guessing that the shark thought that the surfer would taste like his surf board wax so he left him alone .
i actually read that great white sharks actually prefer to snack or lunch on [[ORG]] . no really ! i 'm just saying .
surfer= top water bait
" [[GPE]] officials reporting a surfer was bit by a shark .. " : even the reporters ca n't speak [[LANGUAGE]] . how about " was bitten " ?
oh hell no !
the shark was sniffing him and see if he smelled juicy .
like a grasshopper on a bass pond , fish food .
some of these statements by these so called experts that people being bitten by these sharks is a good sign , are sick ! a totally warped way of thinking !
couple of days should do it . all the sharks will be gone by then good thinking ! lol
surfers in [[GPE]] should expect to be swimming with sharks . they 're all over the place .
an image , from when i was a kid , fishing for snook at grandpas dock at [[TIME]] , under the snook light ;) just popped in there . the surfer is the shrimp and mr . [[PERSON]] jaws , [[NORP]] chomp right behind .
that was a close call ? such click bait ... the shark did n't even break the surface of the water , it clearly was not a close call ...
of course , now , we are all hearing the " jaws " theme song in the back of our minds . ;)
sharks do n't attack attorneys . professional courtesy .
small shark .... i had larger blues mess with me surfing so [[PERSON]] .
this is why you never go surfing , dipped in [[ORG]] sauce
why am i laughing so hard at such a dumb joke ! lol literally !
[[PERSON]] ... happy the [[NORP]] surfer 🏄 is both safe and sound .
was it a divorce attorney or a personal injury attorney ? ca n't quite tell from the picture . glad the surfer is ok ...
difference tween a dead snake in the road and a dead attorney .. there are skid marks before the snake .
what name does a shark give to a female [[PERSON]] ? [[ORG]]
loan shark
what do you call a lawyer at the bottom of the sea ? a good start .
know the difference between a lawyer and a catfish ? [[CARDINAL]] of them is a bottom dwelling scum sucker , and the other is just a catfish .
it 's not an attorney ... they're bottom feeders .
a divorce one posing as a shark
let 's see , surfing in shark infested water . here 's your sign .....
[[ORDINAL]] he bites off your leg , and then you both sue the beach for lack of warning ....
personal injury . he sniffed and there was not enough there to make it worth his while .
[[ORG]]
from what i can tell i think it was a loan shark .
it was [[GPE]] according to hiden
looked like [[PERSON]] from that pic
it might have been a life insurance salesman .
attacking from behind like a coward- it must be a [[NORP]]
[[ORG]] ..
it was prudent to get out of the water . as for a it being a dangerous encounter , in this case the shark either was n't hungry or figured out he was not worth the effort to attack . the shark checked him out then swam away .
yes , but way too close for . comfort .
he had [[PERSON]] foot , and painted nails . sharks are discriminate eaters !
while windsurfing off of central [[GPE]] west coast , i 've been approached several times my [[QUANTITY]] hammerhead sharks , and it did n't bother me at all .
maybe the next time .
baby , there ’s a shark in the water ! v v brown 🎶
oh my gosh that gives me chills
time to play the lottery .
[[PERSON]] knows it 's not the [[ORDINAL]] time . just one of the few that gets on film .
what would an ocean be without a creature lurking in the dark deep
a pool ?
safer !
like [[GPE]] , [[GPE]]
