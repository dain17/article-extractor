so long , so long , so long and thanks for all the fish !
what the hell was that [[ORG]] ?
what ever it was it sucked .
what a waste ! the captions completely obscured the video ... nice editing !
well , you destroyed the video of the dolphins with your captions . forget about the video . it 's useless .
this is the finest piece of editing i 've ever seen . the smooth flow , the barely noticeable cuts , the subtitle taking up [[PERCENT]] of the screen at the end with other subtitles only obstructing everything else ... absolutely stunning . i bet the editor had [[TIME]] of editing experience in the industry before showing his / her prowess in this video . ( danger : sarcasm present . i think an embryo has more experience and talent than the editor here does . )
yeah . yeah . the dolphin pod challenge is going viral .
click bait ! deceiving headline and video ! the captions covered most of the dolphins . i hate the way news media runs their stiff anymore . they either having extremely annoying , shouting news / weather casters with annoying voices , or , they cover [[CARDINAL]] the screen with captions / titles and what have you . it 's one of the reasons why i rid myself of tv . everybody shouts and yells anymore . nobody just talks to each other !
click bait
now hiring : production manager
my dancing ant video did n't go viral no matter how big the text was that i put in front of it !
why have text block us from seeing the dolphins ? poorly done .
where are [[TIME]] ? ? ? ? ? ?
too bad no one could see them with all the writing all over them .
that was the lamest video ever ! ! ! ! wow . what a waste of time ...... well done . next time actually show what you are talking about , ok ?
worst video editing i 've ever seen . took a good video and ruined it .
got it u can load text , where are the dolphins ?
i would have loved to enjoy the video but you just had to ruin it with plastering your words all over the screen . who do you have doing this job , a kid who does n't know better ?
ummm those are dolphns swimming not dancing ... and out of focus ... and blocked by text ... and those were porpoise
make a video that we can see pictures .... not boxes !
why post a link to a video that is nothing but some quotes and [[TIME]] of dolphins swimming . where is the dancing ? talk about a crap link .
he filmed them for 20 min . and this is what we get to see , [[ORG]] is really going down hill fast .
pretty cool . it would have been nicer if the text was not blocking the screen .
was there a video ? all i saw were words .
exactly ! ! come on [[ORG]] news !
look , stunning footage of text covering up a dolphin pod .
the dolphins just found out about [[PERSON]] losing the election .
dolphins do this all the time . it is n't news necessarily .... but it is pretty cool seeing what these animals do .
how could i see them with all the narration covering them ? ? ?
[[ORG]] video . no biggie , good the story . i never knew that a group of dolphins were called a pod . interesting stuff .
dolphins gettin ' their groove on . woo hoo !
unsupervised [[ORG]] interns are running this website
yup . great video . [[ORG]] . when are the webby awards ? because you earned it . what a great piece of crap .
if anyone cares to read the comments first do n't bother clicking on the video coz it 's just more [[ORG]] clickbait . there are no dancing dolphins or anything that approaches it
would have been an awesome story ( if the headline and the video matched up ? just thinking out loud here ? ) . otherwise ... really enjoyed it . great music . excellent font .
whoever put this video together --- how'bout next time letting us see the video instead of blocking it with comments ?
so thanks for a video of water and words and no awesome dolphin dance ...
that would have been a good video ... if they did n't ruin it by putting giant text all over the image .
[[ORG]] . video . editing . ever .
so um . footage of the dancing ? maybe include that part ?
dolphins are the most amazing animals . playful , inquisitive ! they have approached us on the boat and have actually positioned their bodies sideways so you can look them eye to eye . now i 'm sure they 're just doing that to see if we 'd toss the some fish , but they are almost canine like in their behavior .
[[CARDINAL]] dolphin was dancing , the rest were making comments and stuffing dollars in her garter . now none of them can be a [[ORG]] .
stunning video of block text . [[ORG]] . i 'm ecstatic i got to see that stunning video .
