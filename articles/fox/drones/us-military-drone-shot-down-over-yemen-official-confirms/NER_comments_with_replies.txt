hmmm drone shot down in [[GPE]] what a [[GPE]] drone doing into [[GPE]] airspace anyway stop bullying other nations .
maybe the tanker will have a rudder " malfunction " . it happened to the [[ORG]] .
a lot of keyboard warrior generals and geniuses .
time to get that tanker and pay yourself back with that oil ...
this article implies the shooting down of the drone is tied to trump pulling out of the nuclear deal . we pulled out of the nuclear deal because [[GPE]] never had the intention of following it . the centrifuges would have been built , the missiles will be constructed and the drones were going to be shot down anyway .
we are flying the drones at to high of an altitude .
$ [[MONEY]] mil down the drain . we need to build these things way cheaper . i ’m thinking so they cost less than an sa-6 missile .
the houthis are a highly - advanced technological society easily capable of making anti - aircraft missiles , right ?
[[CARDINAL]] more drones to go [[ORG]] ...
" on [[DATE]] , human rights watch said the [[NORP]] - led coalition carried out [[CARDINAL]] deadly attacks on [[NORP]] fishing boats in [[DATE]] , killing [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] fishermen , including [[CARDINAL]] children . " the [[NORP]] have been killing [[NORP]] fisherman for [[CARDINAL]] yrs . while we sell them weapons . what have the [[NORP]] done in [[DATE]] as heinous as that ?
the mq-9 cost us over 10 million each . it is armed .
so [[NORP]] , defending themselves from the [[NORP]] / [[GPE]] terror invasion , which has killed [[CARDINAL]] and put millions at risk from bombs , disease , starvation and thirst , are the aggressors ? the drone was attacking [[NORP]] ... and [[NORP]] shot down the drone ... in [[GPE]] ... and somehow , the [[GPE]] is the victim . wow . that 's some world class spinning right there . i guess the [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] have n't quite destroyed all of the hospitals and schools yet . have another beer , folks . murder is thirsty work .
its a world gone mad
would be nice to have more details .... what kind of missile and what are we doing to make sure it does n't happen again . drones are not inexpensive .
i hope we 're responding to these drone downings behind the scenes . [[GPE]] needs to be sent a signal . i do n't mind not being told about it as long as it 's being done .
in a way , any [[GPE]] soldier without a commission could be considered a " drone "
i would torpedo any [[NORP]] oil boat every time and claim it was n't us .
order another [[CARDINAL]] .... cha- ching ! !
notice how this story just drones on and on ...
perhaps a squad of special forces could " arrange " for that tanker to dock in a [[GPE]] friendly port , where it could be impounded . the [[ORG]] should not be encouraging the [[NORP]] by trading with them nor ignoring [[GPE]] sanctions against [[GPE]] .
not doing anything on the downing of a [[GPE]] drone by [[GPE]] is a precedent . now this . enough is enough .
yes , it was a lib flying the drone . they thought it was free .....
probably time to equip expensive drones with defensive capabilities .
have my comments been turned off ? testing testing , [[DATE]] . shock and awe campaign in progress .
no pilots lost . send in another one . might be an idea to equip them to deal with missile fire though .
[[ORG]] , but i would n't want to be sitting on land that belongs to someone that has gotten [[PERSON]] attention by shooting down anything that [[GPE]] owns .
i see a lot of comments about taking out [[GPE]] 's air defenses with anti - radar missiles & that sort of thing . that works fine with fixed - position anti - aircraft batteries with active search & acquisition radars . but what do you do if it 's some guy in a dashiki with a shoulder - fired anti - aircraft missile ? they 're very lethal , easily transportable & the [[ORG]] line - of - sight guidance systems emit no radar or anything else to let you know you 're being tracked . and they cost a fraction of the aircraft they bring down .
what ever happened to the “ return fire from the source ” commitment . the world should know if any of our assets are shot at - plan for a “ visit ” from several [[PRODUCT]] ’s ...
[[ORG]] : i like drones who do n't get shot .....
if somebody needs to beat up [[GPE]] let the [[NORP]] 's do it
poking the bear ......
drone for drone , they probably have less then us .
nice job houthis ! finally , some troops i can respect .
we have to step up and tell the eu to either join us or we will go it alone and all ships will be stopped and not released .
that 's why we use drones , the cost is in dollars , not lives
talib and [[PERSON]] added an earmark to a [[NORP]] spending bill that funded the [[ORG]] 's surface to air missile program .... just like [[PERSON]] funded [[GPE]] 's nuclear missile program .... traitors in our government
what is a houthi and how can these sand people shoot down a [[MONEY]] dollar plane ? we need to protect these valuable drones , but after obama allowed one to be captured by [[GPE]] , intact , it was all over ...
after [[DATE]] , [[LOC]] is still running around killing each other , fighting over territories and religion . they are simply unable to get their act together . they create nothing , nor to they contribute to the world in any other positive way . they are stuck in the stone age , therefore rely on other countries for any technology they possess .
time to start practicing on the [[ORG]] 's air defense systems to get ready for [[GPE]] 's . some directed counter fire with jamming support quickly bring their capability to its knees . might even bag some [[ORG]] members at the same time .
need to start using our ufos , not many of those get shot down :)
[[PERSON]] : " i know more about drones than anybody . " said in [[DATE]] .
time to make the grass grow .
their really pushin it
it may have only been hardware and not one of our aviators , but the punishment must be the same . the closest settlement to the launch site should be erased .
the old drones will eventually be lost . the new autonomous stealth drones , not so much .
i thought this was precisely why we used drones in high - threat airspace like this ; so that we did n't risk a pilot in case one gets shot down .
houthi extremists were elated -- they said " [[CARDINAL]] more drone " and they will have enough parts to build their own ...
someone help me recall the verse in the [[WORK_OF_ART]] that forsees the apocalypse to begin in [[LOC]] . it appears the stage is being set . should we engage ? of course it 's began so many times already . god bless [[GPE]] . [[DATE]] [[PERSON]]
[[PERSON]] as our drones have no business in [[GPE]] where [[NORP]] are murdering [[CARDINAL]] of people ..
do n't fly close to the countries ... you do n't get shot down ..... you try to spy on them .. expect to get shot down
i am really getting annoyed at our lax daisy government attitude regarding our assets . these drones cost [[MONEY]] a piece and no retaliation ?
sure seems odd , a band of rogue [[ORG]] rebels supported by [[GPE]] can fairly well take out whatever they want . a [[GPE]] drone , targeted civilians or airports in [[GPE]] at will . . .
well ... probably about time to turn [[GPE]] in a glass parking lot .
" just a lone wolf engaged in a little workplace violence . " ~ [[PERSON]]
[[PERSON]] 's friends at it again ...
a mere pittance when compared to " deficit don " and his golf expeditions .
so much freak - out over an unmanned drone getting shot down in some of the worst airspace in the world . imagine a real war against a peer - opponent where losses are in the [[CARDINAL]] each day .
and is the [[GPE]] going to do something about it ? nope ! because our commander - in - chief does n't want to have [[CARDINAL]] widowers over there !
as we are not at war with [[GPE]] , unfortunately there is n't much we can do about them shooting down a spy drone over their territory . if we want to officially " free the [[NORP]] 's " from the rebels , then that is different . best we could do is sell the drones to [[NORP]] , have our consultants operate the devices , and then if they go down , the [[NORP]] 's can wipe them out with our supplied weaponry .
let 's show some of the features of these drones !
calculated risk .
i have to laugh at how some people get so shocked when something of ours gets shot down , like our aircraft are protected by force fields or cloaking devices . if it flies & can be seen it can be brought down . nobody remembers when an f-117 was shot down over [[GPE]] ?
we know who did it because the armored camels they were riding blew their knees out after [[QUANTITY]] trying to escape .
to close to re election . if trump wins all hell will break loose .
we need some stealth drones .
how may is this now ? are we going to return fire ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the [[NORP]] missile was marked " paid for by [[PERSON]] obama " .
[[MONEY]] in federal subsidies for [[NORP]] oil
we should make drones look like [[PERSON]] [[PRODUCT]] , etc ... just smaller . how are these desert rats going to tell the difference ? and the best part is you keep them freaked out and wondering what we 're up to . lol
[[GPE]] is a nation of [[ORG]] .
send mq-9 reapers with a couple agm-88 harm missiles to take out the [[ORG]] radars … the missiles cost [[MONEY]] each versus [[MONEY]] for each drone … then , other drones can take out the [[ORG]] missiles remaining on the ground with gbu-12 [[PRODUCT]] laser - guided bombs , agm-114 [[PRODUCT]] air - to - ground missiles , or gbu-38 [[ORG]] ( [[ORG]] ) … also , drones can deploy the aim-9 sidewinder , and the aim-92 [[PRODUCT]] air - to - air missiles against enemy fighter planes .
seems to me that somebody needs a moab dropped on their head .
a goat with explosives attach to it was launched by [[ORG]] , [[CARDINAL]] in a [[CARDINAL]] shot
justnukethem
maybe the [[NORP]] reverse - engineered some of the [[NORP]] weapons [[PERSON]] gave to them in what is known [[EVENT]] affair .
who the hell is in charge of these drone missions ? this is the [[ORDINAL]] drone shot down in [[DATE]] . somebody running these operations does n't know what the hell they are doing .
why is the [[GPE]] flying drones over [[GPE]] ? this was n't publicized until now . we are probably assisting [[GPE]] bombing campaign of the country because they do n't want to accept the new government there . it 's a humanitarian crisis the [[GPE]] is aiding and abetting .
[[PERSON]] ( man - portable air - defense systems ) get more & more lethal all the time & cost a fraction of the aircraft they bring down . and the command line - of - sight models are particularly deadly as they emit no radar signal to be detected by the target ; you wo n't know it 's coming at you until " boom " .
there goes [[PRODUCT]] . as noted below , far better than a pilot being killed or captured .
[[ORG]] , we ca n't keep fighting [[GPE]] 's and [[GPE]] unjust wars , this is just getting more absurd by [[TIME]] and has got to stop .
another one bits the dust ... and the tax payers get a bill to replace it ! do n't these drones carry [[PRODUCT]] missiles . why are n't we shooting back ? [[GPE]] hijacks super tankers and our battle group stationed there does nothing .. who is in charge of this fiasco ! !
they can take ships shoot down drowns . they know we are politically correct .
now let 's add this up . a [[MONEY]] drone shot down by supporters of [[GPE]] . an [[NORP]] supertanker headed to [[GPE]] with [[MONEY]] worth of light crude oil . i think it 's a no - brainer . take the tanker out by submarine torpedo at [[TIME]] and deny everything .
so the [[GPE]] drone violated [[GPE]] airspace .
are they using missiles made in [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] ?
[[ORG]] , this is so simple . just send them a plane full of cash and have them sign a superficial agreement that makes you look good so you can get reelected . why do you always have to do things the hard way ?
many arm chair [[WORK_OF_ART]] on here , and some pick at the president when he said he know 's more than the general 's ? wow !
i honestly do n’t understand why we are even over in this part of the world anymore .....
just arm the drones with anti radar weapons and loose at any active radar detected . remember " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " work .
use drone parts for sale , " military secrets the most fleeting of all "
gibraltar was never a friend to any nation . when [[GPE]] invaded , they welcomed them with open arms . great , come on in , you are our kind of people .
drones must be cheap , no counter measures on them and they seem to be expendable - must cost us taxpayers what [[MONEY]] each ? : s
good . the [[GPE]] should stop supporting [[GPE]] siege on [[GPE]] .
gee , and [[GPE]] is such a friendly country .
thank god for drones . no more [[PERSON]] incidents . also , still thanking god [[PERSON]] is n’t president .
if you give a criminal money , he will use it to buy a gun . obama basically did the same with [[GPE]] .
looks like [[GPE]] is putting to military use the billions they got from the [[PERSON]] administration .
high risk airspace over civil wars where you 're not always [[PERCENT]] sure of who 's shooting at who is why we use drones in the [[ORDINAL]] place . they 're expendable . pilots are n't .
so , who 's the [[CARDINAL]] denier that deleted my factual post ?
well there goes [[MONEY]] that was ever taken out of my paychecks . wasted on a drone that was able to be shot down .
we have given [[GPE]] so much money over [[DATE]] to the tune of [[MONEY]] , and we allowed their spies the like of [[PERSON]] to steal all of our military secrets with impunity that our military is behind theirs now . does the missile test with them in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] ring any bells ?
let 's see , can i hit a non - maneuvering drone in straight , level , slow speed flight ? wow , that sure is a great feat is n't it ?
lucky shot .
[[GPE]] and [[GPE]] also fly the mq-9 .
a couple megatons will solve that problem very fast .
here 's something we probably wo n't hear [[DATE]] : any [[CARDINAL]] of the [[NORP]] presidential candidates stepping up to a microphone and saying what they would do in response . nor will any " news " reporter put them on the spot and ask them .
do you want to laugh ?
time to put missiles on the drones and fire back !
when did we declare war on [[GPE]] and why ?
there absolutely should be a detonation device on all drones . it 's bad when barbarians obtain blueprints for how to build this incredible technology . we should be able to blow it up rather than let these things fall into enemy hands . same with [[PRODUCT]] bombers , etc . now they have it . what good is high tech advancements if they get their hands on it ?
no biggie . drones are expendable . human pilots are not .
[[ORG]] ... that stinks !
i hate to say it but [[GPE]] is treating trump like a ? ! [[MONEY]] ! same way [[GPE]] treated obama bomb their leaders ’ homes . bomb them into nonexistence
man - portable shoulder - fired missile systems are getting better all the time & cost much less than the aircraft they bring down .
drones lives matter .
simple ...... just take the tanker as payment for the [[CARDINAL]] drones .
" [[NORP]] - backed [[ORG]] group " thanks obama for the cash !
[[GPE]] makes them every day ... and charges the [[GPE]] [[MONEY]] each . that 's roughly .33 .cents per [[GPE]] citizen . if you exclude the homeless than it 's much more .
we do n't know if it was [[GPE]] forces that shot down the drone . but if we can examine the wreckage , we may be able to find out what type of weapon was used , and that may lead us to the culprit . at that point , retaliation might be appropriate .
what are we doing there !
if it was n't for [[PERSON]] israel we would n't be in [[LOC]] , that 's the sad reality . potus said it himself .
and stop that oil tanker while your at it , destroying every [[ORG]] site over there !
clowns of today we need [[GPE]] and they need us . they provide us with a lot of needed information . if we ever turn our back on [[GPE]] the [[GPE]] would no longer be a nation . god will destroy us . if [[GPE]] is guilty of shutting down this drone we should sink they 're little small boats and destroy a military base within [[GPE]] .
time to let the tungsten rods off the rail !
they are missing the mini - drones which have a radar signature too small for the surface to air missiles to lock on .
these fools keep stirring the pot . we will wake up [[TIME]] and the [[ORG]] rebels and [[NORP]] will be missing a lot of military assets they have been using against us . [[PERSON]] , [[GPE]] and our president [[PERSON]] .
for those war hawks out there ... be careful about grabbing any tiger by the tail . until [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] , harms us directly we need to expect that tensions will grow and our surveillance equipment will suffer losses . all part of the equation when trying to keep the world from throwing [[ORG]] at each other .
if we are producing more oil , and exporting our surplus , why are we still messing around in [[LOC]] ?
since they seem to like [[GPE]] hardware failing on them we should arrange for a bit more to fall
[[GPE]] .. another fine country that libs probably want immigrants from .
trump thinks twitter is a missile defense program . “ haha . just shot down [[PERSON]] , [[PERSON]] is next ”
with an [[NORP]] supplied [[ORG]] purchased from [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] no doubt .
if [[GPE]] flew a drone over [[GPE]] we would shoot it down too .
shooting down our drones does nothing , of course , to correct the sorry conditions in our [[NORP]] - run cities such as [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , or [[GPE]] .
once your adversary gets the right weapons & the range he 'll bring down your aircraft . [[PERSON]] found that out .
remember when [[ORG]] pardoned that [[ORG]] submariner who took pictures of the nuclear reactor on our subs and was gon na sell em to the [[NORP]] ?
absolutely nothing good has ever come out of [[LOC]] . this garbage has been going on for far too long . we need to put an end to it for good .
[[PRODUCT]] flying over [[CARDINAL]] times could shove the problem .
the pilot that was remotely flying it saw " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " on his screens .
nothing will happen and the whole world knows it .
you do n't think [[MONEY]] obama gave [[GPE]] is paying for any of these anti - aircraft [[PRODUCT]] do you ?
the only thing these people understand is brute force . you do n’t negotiate with terrorists or animals . you send a message they wo n’t forget
[[CARDINAL]] thing i never liked about drones is that they are too vulnerable to attack . slow and big . no defense capabilities .
meanwhile obama stares solemnly at an empty pallet in his back yard .
i heard [[GPE]] shot dówn one of our drones too .
it went down on purpose carrying false plans and data to spread confusion .. tactics used in the mountains of [[GPE]] . the enemy recovers the craft along with a data storage that is oddly not encrypted and easy to get into . false plans aswell as fake proof of current troop movements . forces the enemy to prepare for an assault from [[CARDINAL]] direction and then get massacred quickly from another . that or the drone has a " marked package drop off of materials . once found the goods has a gps that tracks where the " goods " is being taken to so real new plans can start bombing underground bases or freeing high priority targets being held ransom .
why are we spending hardworking [[NORP]] taxpayer money spying for and supporting the [[NORP]] with their brutal attacks on civilians .
they need counter measures on those drones .. like a laser or ?
trump pulls us out of the nuclear deal with [[GPE]] , the only thing from keeping them from developing a nuke . [[GPE]] then immediately pursues developing a nuke . what a surprise .
people , [[GPE]] is our ally . the nation of [[GPE]] did not shoot down the drone , it was [[NORP]] forces inside of [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] has once again bullied [[WORK_OF_ART]] . even they know how to beat a bully at his own craft .
quit attacking [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] and its allies are the # [[MONEY]] killers of [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] . after [[QUANTITY]] asked us if they could help us against [[ORG]] . [[NORP]] held candlelight vigils to mourn our dead .
it is time to strike [[GPE]] swiftly and decisively . these people have had their chance to overthrow this regime for [[DATE]] . send planes and cripple them immediately . it ’s gotten ridiculous . you are going to have to fight them sooner or later anyway . remember , [[GPE]] warned of [[GPE]] and look what happened . how many men killed by [[NORP]] backed forces ? how much money spent making sure we could defend ourselves against them ?
solve the problem take [[GPE]] off the map .
shoot down a drone … wipe out a city … ok ok [[CARDINAL]] mud huts …
wait [[TIME]] ... you're saying that our aircraft are n't magically invulnerable & can be shot down ?
shock and awe .
congratulations to the [[ORG]] rebels on their [[ORDINAL]] achievement . may they all be killed by female pilots so allah will never embrace them in paradise
take the tanker of oil as payment for the drone . eurowimps can cry all they want
that is why we send drones into those regions .
[[GPE]] is just looking for trouble , but i do nt want another war and other so called allies should help not look the other way .
for every drone they shoot down , shoot [[CARDINAL]] tomahawk missles into the city .
maybe trump can buy [[GPE]] ? since the [[GPE]] deal fell thru ....
why are we fighting for [[GPE]] and for [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] ?
so twitter is not an effective missile defense tool ?
strap a defensive weapons on them over there . they are too expensive to keep letting them get shot down
take the tanker on the high seas ...
time to light up the sky !
why did n’t trump send out a tweet to intercept that rocket before it hit the drone ?
ssdd we 're using drones for a reason
trump:”no ! not r2d2 ! ! ” mulvaney:”sir we said drones not droids ”
time to show [[GPE]] that they are not as tough as they think they are !
why do we support [[NORP]] , strict radical islam over [[NORP]] ? [[MONEY]]
that drone cost [[MONEY]] ..... or .... about the cost of [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] golf trip to [[GPE]] ..
well , that 's the [[ORDINAL]] in [[DATE]] . is it time to send some assault aircraft in , and send a wake up call to the [[NORP]] ? if destruction is what they want , give it to them .
trump should fly around [[GPE]] in [[PRODUCT]] to give the [[NORP]] an alternative target to our drones ... they cost [[MONEY]] ...
the houthis are backed by ... [[GPE]] . that 's [[CARDINAL]] acts of war against the [[GPE]] i 'd say it 's time for a little action .
the entire world see the weakness in [[ORG]] !
why is the [[GPE]] military in [[GPE]] ?
so what ? what would w e do if another country sent a drone over [[GPE]] land ?
trump and the [[ORG]] squandering our national assets ..... pathetic ..
there goes another [[MONEY]] . why are n't these drones stealthy .
ah [[GPE]] , yet another one of those obama " success " stories .
[[PERSON]] may not even know where [[GPE]] is .
we seem to have a problem with our drones - they are apparently easy to shoot down .
at this point with [[ORG]] its easier to remember which countries we are not a war with then the ones we are .
time to eliminate their are defense .
are we going to wait until they shoot down a manned aircraft ? take out the missile site .
well the [[ORDINAL]] question that comes to mind is ..... why are we flying drones over other countries . i am sure we would not like that if people did that to us .
yup , it ’s about time for some shock and awe . we showed restraint for the sake of [[NORP]] life in [[GPE]] . and now the wrong people have been emboldened .
they had better not shoot down another one , or [[ORG]] will send them a very nasty tweet !
it is funny to me that folks on here condemn trump for not doing anything in this region yet when something like this happens their all like what were we doing there to to begin with ? grow up dems face reality not everyone in this world are our friends and we need to protect ourselves like it or not
[[GPE]] uses their drones to bomb innocent [[NORP]] children .
none of the [[NORP]] presidential hopefuls have said what they would do in response .
[[NORP]] trolls breathe a sigh of relief as it takes some of the attention away from the sorry state of our [[NORP]] - run cities .
well this definitely shows the inadequacies of drones . they can be jammed with rudimentary means , and can be shot down by shabbily equipped militaries and militias . at least we do n’t lose people when it happens .
trump should not have been so nice to [[GPE]] after the [[ORDINAL]] shoot down ..... now we have double work to do .
the [[NORP]] hanging out in this thread are unable to say what a " president [[PERSON]] " would do in response . all they can do is insult and mock president [[PERSON]] .
hey , just a thought . would our military be wise to build in an incendiary device to all drones ? that way if one is shot down over hostile territory we could destroy it before the technology falls into unfriendly hands .
[[ORG]] republican [[ORG]] 2020 65 [[NORP]] seats in [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
find who did this and send the receipt taped to a missile back at them .
i say we decimate every air missile battery in [[GPE]] for starters . and we can do that . and if there is any [[NORP]] troops around it , oh well to bad for them !
wild idea here ...... how about the [[ORG]] stops wasting the [[NORP]] taxpayers money being the policeman of the world and simply defend our own borders ? .
bound to happen , once the bad guys get the tools and the range . ask [[PERSON]] .
job security ! people will get paid good money to rebuild the drone . thank you [[GPE]] ! we are hoping that someday soon we can return the favor ! ! !
time to add stealth technology to the drones .
go back and light 'em up !
well , what would we do if someone was spying on us over our land ? we would shoot it down . this is just part of the game .
if they were flying drones over our airspace , would we shoot them down ?
and at that launch site that fired at the drone should be made into a desert wasteland [[QUANTITY]] in each direction
i still struggle to find any real benefit , for anyone , in our continued involvement in these conflicts . seldom is the government we oppose really any worse than the one we support .
expendable . no human life lost is always a good thing .
well , they can pinpoint the origin of that sam , send a moab to that location and call it square .
why are we involved in this ?
the [[GPE]] drone program is no longer functional when a [[ORDINAL]] rate nation like [[GPE]] can shoot down its [[ORG]] . the lack of stealth in our drones is inexcusable at this point .
we are sending our guided equipment to the wrong direction . [[CARDINAL]] guided missile to the [[ORG]] and the situation will calm substantially if not completely .
so when we determine iran did it , what happens . we let them float off another illegal tanker and given them a hearty pat on the back ? that 's been the policy so far . we need to learn . these people understand death and mayhem . give it to them and they will instantly back off .
the [[ORG]] sure enjoy posting drivel ! it must get boring down in [[GPE]] 's basement !
[[GPE]] " military " drone . ok what other kinds of [[GPE]] drones are over [[GPE]] ? any [[ORG]] drones delivering packages ?
drones save pilot 's lives ... now let 's get to the bottom of this ....
so , who do we send the bill to ?
drones should be outfitted with an automatic emp device so if it gets hit , the device is triggered , and shuts down everything in [[QUANTITY]] radius ....
this is where we need to ask ... why are our drones in [[GPE]] ? [[ORG]] has not authorized this intervention ...
ok . sieze an oil tanker for payment . you 're welcome .
i do n't know about you but if there was a [[NORP]] drone flying over our country i would assume it would get shot down too . why do we have to be the worlds police force ? it 's bad enough people are throwing buckets of water on our own police with no consequences . we should stop flying drones over other countries unless we are at war . remember , curiosity killed the cat .
i wonder who [[GPE]] is cheering for ?
oops . oh well , that 's why drones are used instead of manned aircraft .
well , there goes another $ [[MONEY]] down the drain .
[[GPE]] tanker sailing away because some nations mistakenly believed their tankers and crews would be released . do you ever assume someone will do the right thing without negotiating ?
do n't worry guys . [[ORG]] said he ripped up the [[NORP]] deal because he could negotiate a way better one . it 's coming , any day now . just keep waiting !
alright that does it ! ! time for real action against [[GPE]] !
by a surface - to - air missile operated by the [[NORP]] - backed [[ORG]] group war with [[GPE]] is coming close ... very close ...
[[GPE]] now shot down [[CARDINAL]] drones and [[GPE]] - backed [[ORG]] is shooting rockets at [[GPE]] on a [[DATE]] basis from [[GPE]] . that is a clear declaration of war , [[ORG]] needs to declare war on [[GPE]] and end their regime . [[GPE]] , after all is said and done ended up being a lot better off even though it was tough , they now are a largely democratic government and [[GPE]] ally . sure , when obama backed off the pressure , [[ORG]] took over rather quickly , but both [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] restored order and [[ORG]] is now just another cave - dwelling terrorist cell . the [[GPE]] military can and should reform [[LOC]] and turn them allies against [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] , we just do n't have the political willpower to do it .
great .... another waste of [[MONEY]] for people who hate us , in a country we do n't belong for a cause that does n't exist . good job [[GPE]] .
turn [[GPE]] into a parking lot with a wingless shaped drone .
was it aiding war crimes by [[GPE]]
well , we 'll just send another .
trump is trying to find out if this drone had a pilot or not .
if this had happened on obama ’s watch he would say , do n’t cross that red line in the sky again
could have built [[QUANTITY]] of the wall for the cost of this toy .
why does every article written regarding [[GPE]] , or any of their [[ORG]] , always reference [[ORG]] 's decision to exit " the worst deal ever " ? ? ? ?
better a drone than a manned aircraft .
i wonder if we 'd take down a [[NORP]] drone flying over [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] ?
oh darn .
ah good ole [[GPE]] , the country of famine . why because the people in power would rather take world aid , starve the people , build the military time to stop aid to a country who does not take care of their people .
no one will ever take us seriously if we do n't retaliate this time !
are we at war with [[GPE]] ? why is anybody surprised that they responded to a violation of their airspace ?
any [[ORDINAL]] world gang feels they can shoot at the [[GPE]] military now . time to set an example with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , or [[GPE]] .
at least [[PERSON]] was n't involved .
i guess that does beg the question why a [[GPE]] drone was flying without authorization in [[GPE]] airspace ?
there will be retaliation for this !
trump will release a statement that it was a drone without a pilot .
too bad it was an unarmed drone at least it could have fired back when attacked .
really ? with what ? [[PERSON]] supplied by [[GPE]] ? paid for with the money obama gave them ?
and somehow the alarm clock for the [[ORG]] has gone off .
people need to see we are not a country to mess with . reach out and make them pay . otherwise we lose face and look weak .
why are we in [[GPE]] anyway ? that is a war zone where the [[NORP]] are bombing civilians . did [[ORG]] got us involved there to kow tow to [[ORG]] ?
lost another one ?
this is the [[ORDINAL]] time a [[GPE]] drone has been shot down in that part of the world in [[DATE]] . meanwhile , [[ORG]] us focused on buying [[GPE]] . smh
bone spurs is just giving away more of our military technology to [[GPE]] ’s enemies . . . nothing new to see here
time for trump to send a message to [[GPE]] . and let [[GPE]] see what 's coming
i hope these are all poison pills .
retaliate with superior force . take out [[CARDINAL]] grid squares where the shot came from .
they ’ll regret that when we start dropping bombs on their cities .
well if we were over their airspace then what do you expect . take the loss and move on .. countries have a right to defend their soverign territory , especially airspace .
predators do not fly very high and are fairly slow . also , they do the best work at lower altitudes being equipped with [[PRODUCT]] missiles .
