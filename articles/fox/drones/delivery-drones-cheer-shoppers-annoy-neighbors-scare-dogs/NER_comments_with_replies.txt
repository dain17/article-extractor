how well does a drone fly with [[PERSON]] lodged in its propellers ?
the larger ones will cut right through the silly string . the propellers can do serious damage or remove fingers . the smaller one 's do n't handle this type obstruction well , but it 'll take something more that silly string to bring a delivery drone down .
just throw a newspaper at it as it 's in a hover to land , problem solved .
learn to use a slingshot
i wonder if they can drop me some dope off at my front door .
strictly from a technological standpoint , without a doubt this can be done .
well , at least these drones would be good practice shooting for skeet shooters ..... just waltz out into your yard and cut loose with yer [[CARDINAL]] gauge ...............
but so much more challenging with [[CARDINAL]] and a scope
the drone pilot will want you to pay the fine and ordered restitution in cash .
if they ca n't see you they ca n't id you , a good worked [[CARDINAL]] could pop it at [[QUANTITY]] easily . but this story is about [[GPE]] and since the [[NORP]] have had their guns taken away they ca n't even defend themselves from a little overpriced toy .
[[ORG]] the noise bothers me [[ORG]]
if people were to shoot a few of these down then things would change .
wo n't happen in the [[GPE]] either , well , it might , but the shooter will find themselves charged with destruction of property . homeowners do not own the airspace above their home and a lot of states have laws on the books addressing drone flight over property . for instance , in [[ORG]] , a drone may transit a property as long as it does not linger for he purpose of surveilance .
then shoot it from a duck blind .
not gunna happen in [[GPE]] . we hate guns and despise the criminals and other riff - raff who own them .
so does it hurt when your government took your right to defend yourself away ? ? ?
so will you also have to import some men when your women want to get pregnant ? i guess you can always call on the [[GPE]] , we saved you in [[EVENT]] , i guess we can do it again .
use a boomerang , or would that be cultural appropriation ?
‚Äú that damned old wheel will be the death of us ‚Äù says barny to fred .
time for some electromagnetic interference ?
does the drone knock on your front door or ring the doorbell ? does it drop your package from [[QUANTITY]] ? do drones get lost ? will they pick up a return ?
what we need is suppressors for shotguns .
the same was said about the automobile . i ‚Äôd like to think there ‚Äôs a way to integrate this correctly , but until that way is found it ‚Äôs likely to be annoying at best . time will tell .
[[CARDINAL]] more reason that i 'm glad i live on [[QUANTITY]] out in the country . could you imagine living in some crowded subdivision with those dam / n / ed things flying around all the time ?
very quaint . til ' someone gets an eye taken out by a drone blade . then it 's lawsuit city .
if someone is comparing the sound of a drone to the sound of a chain saw " gone ballistic " , they are exaggerating a little . no , they are not quiet , but they are n't that loud either . once they get above [[QUANTITY]] , they are difficult to hear at all and are about the same as a small plane flying overhead at [[QUANTITY]] . also , unless local sound ordinances are violated , homeowners will have difficulty fighting this . plus , the actual deliveries would last about 2 minutes out of your day . how much annoyance can that really be . before you try to damage [[CARDINAL]] or shoot one down , check your local laws and then check with the [[ORG]] . you may find you are going to be the one in trouble .
these things are a menace and should be banned .
obviously , [[NORP]] need their guns back so they can shoot down these drones ....
only in virtual gun - free [[GPE]] , of course ; in the [[GPE]] , those drones would acquire a fatal case of lead poisoning .
so if they are flying over your property , can you shoot them down ?
sadly no but its a shame you ca n't . however if they come in my yard and start recording its fair game . i value my privacy .
no good is going to come of this .
invest in some buckshot üòÅ üòÅ üòÅ
ca n't yet do this in [[GPE]] . [[ORG]] has not granted , or most likely will they ( at least i hope they do not ) , changes to laws necessary to all this .
btw- i fly drones and other rc .
shotgun ... thieves .
do drones fly inverted in [[GPE]] ?
the blades spin clockwise .
at some point , lawmakers will have to look at this issue and define the legal parameters for creating micro - airworthiness routes . the drones do not go away and their use will be even more widespread . in the past rules were created to organize the displacement for cars , boats , airplanes , etc . now it 's time to do the same for the drones .
if it scares dogs into not barking , i 'm all for it .
skeet drone !
if it enters your property does nt that make it your property ? what about the land owners rights ? i do nt know its intention .... i m gon na shoot it down .
i would much rather listen to drones than a bunch of liberal whiners .
" get off my sky ! "
i call that arieal trespass and would shoot it down .
it 's going to make life easier for porch pirates once they install anti - aircraft weapons on their pirate ships .
sling shot is a new toy ! interesting anybody !
these become commonplace here , and i 'll have to cobble together some anti drone defenses for my house .
any drone flying over my property better be able to fly leaded , it 's posted so the drone was warned .
if you 've ever seen the movie wall - e .... that 's where we 're all headed . big fat blobs using our tablets to order things because it 's gotten too difficult to make a friggen cup of hot chocolate .
take a look at any fast food drive - in line - peek in the suvs and you 'll see we 're almost there !
get a gps jammer .
i wonder if it 's legal to down a drone that 's flying over your property ? take one of those guns that shoots a large net to bring it down and then smash it to smithereens .
drones are fancy versions of remote controlled helicopters that we have had for [[DATE]] .
drones are a lot more popular than the remote controlled helicopters , hence there 's a whole lot more of them . that large and growing number of drones , coupled with inexperienced " pilots " , are becoming a nuisance .
there need to be laws made regarding public arial thoroughfares that drones are restricted to . just as the [[ORG]] truck ca n't drive through my lawn to get to my neighbor 's house , so should drones be restricted to flyways .
there are already " flyzones " dictated by the [[ORG]] and height restrictions . plus , you are n't allowed to fly out of line of sight with a drone .
so [[ORG]] will have a person chasing each delivery drone ? it would seem easier for the chaser to be the deliverer .
so the coffee delivery drone is being followed by the drone operator so that it remains in sight ? not sure you thought that one all the way through ...
we could shoot a sidewinder missile at it . wonder if that would do the job ?
you know what is going to happen . on the return flight the drone will be carrying a bomb .
depending on where you live ..... you own the [[ORG]] space above your land [[QUANTITY]] , anything under that is trespassing ..
it 's determined by the area you live . you are entitled to own enough airspace to reasonably enjoy your land . i 'm sure it 'll be in [[ORG]] someday ...
please cite where that is stated . i 'd be interested .
i see a drone war coming . how long before someone puts a weapon on their drone and it takes down another drone ? game on !
i 've seen video where a drone shoots a net to take down drones over no fly zones . most drones flown by hobbyists could n't handle the recoil of a real gun anyways .
do n't forget a drone has a camera and gps on board . so leave your property and wear a mask .
and hope a drone operator , like me , is n't armed and willing to retaliate for it , which i am :-)
the modern version of [[LOC]] ... nice .
shame .... can't fire a real weapon in the city limits unless there is an actual threat to life . however , the beanbag gun will accomplish the same end .
the reincarnation of barrage balloons may soon become a reality . helium , balloons , fishing line , down they come . cheap , easy , 24/7/365 .
cool idea , a fly trap , and legal on your own property .
the public 's understanding of what drones are and do is woefully ignorant . ca n't tell you how many times someone thought i was spying on them because they could see and hear my drone a [[QUANTITY]] up . i 'd show them the pics and video i 'm taking and that normally puts their fears to rest . most drones that high up ca n't zoom in like that . unless it 's hovering outside your window , it 's likely the drone operator is not spying people .
what 's your address then tough guy . ca n't fly it over your property if i do n't know where you are . come on keyboard warrior , cough it up [[PERSON]] .
yes , a commercial drone delivery i can see that being a problem . but hobbiests like me get irritated when someone tries to destroy my property for no other reason then they are irritated because they can hear or see it . i 'm just taking landscape photos and they have no right to destroy my property . from talking to people who are irritated , i find a lot think it 's because i can see things i ca n't with it . most are n't bothered by the noise when it 's [[QUANTITY]] up .
wow , the fact that you do n't know how to get that done does not mean other people wo n't , especially the ones with lots of money , like drug lords , for example .
you talking spying ? unless you are up to no good , there 's really very little reason anyone would try and spy with a drone . as the article says , they are loud which is a dead give away , especially at low altitudes which is where you can actually see enough to spy .
what about spying just for the fun of looking at neighbors doing their thing ? you never know what you can catch on camera . believe me , image zooming will not be a problem .
i suppose there are some that do that but again , the noise gives it away . you can see more with a nice pair of binoculars and the person would be totally clueless it 's happening . i suppose a few would abuse it , but most do n't and try hard to follow the ever increasing regulations that the [[ORG]] puts on their use . most of the time i use it on vacation or when i see a nice landscape shot i can get . again , someone with a regular camera and telephoto lens can do the same thing , just a different angle and the residents around would be clueless . at least with a drone , you know it 's there and you can choose not to do anything you do n't want someone to see . with a telephoto lens , you do n't know that .
the article did n't mention the " spying " aspect of drones . it 's the noise the drones make that are spooking the pets , as well as cutting way down on quality of life for those in the drone 's flight path .
spying or not , the neighbors will think you ‚Äôre a creep .
you know what , neighbors already pee me off !
that 's their problem , not mine . i promise you , they 'll think me a creep anyways if they shoot down my $ [[MONEY]] + drone . i 'll draw blood for that .
feel free to fly it over my property . i 'll destroy it and then you when you come looking for blood .
i will and you wo n't do a thing about it tough guy . lets test it . give me your address and i 'll come over and fly it :-)
so they shoot down your toy flying over their backyard and you will " draw blood ? " lol sounds like you are the one looking at a felony . have some respect for people 's privacy and you wo n't risk losing your investment .
have some respect for other people 's property and you wo n't lose your worthless head over it . i work hard to earn that money . if the courts do n't rectify it to my satisfaction , then i will and i promise it 'll cost the person shooting down the drone a lot more than what i paid for my drone .
my , but you 're a childish sort , are n't you ? you fly your little toy , spying over people 's houses and expect them not to be concerned ? guess what ? if your toy gets shot down , the same gun will defend that person when they see you prancing across the yard wigging out . grow up and learn some respect .
attach your cell phone to it .
there is no law against shooting a mechanical bird out of the sky .
state the law that prohibits a homeowner from clearing an unwanted nuisance on their property ....
that 's actually true -- if you ignore all the laws which prohibit it .
lol ... try doing that to a plane and see what happens . heck , you only have to point a laser at a commercial flight you 'll go to jail .
pull ! ! ! trap shooting ? anyone ?
just make it legal to shoot them down with a slingshot , and it 's all ok .
lol i like to get a drone to deliver a pizza to my house and then a playboy magazine mwahahahaha !
no beer ?
in the future , you will buy your drone based on the caliber of it 's gun ( [[CARDINAL]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[CARDINAL]] etc . )
or maybe you ‚Äôll buy your gun based on the size of the drones flying through your neighborhood .
although an airspace incursion may not be considered trespassing , the uninvited appearance of a drone operator , even to search for a missing drone is , and is illegal as such .
be a billionaire , invent a drone dope similar to fly dope .
a completely new way of doing a person in .
ever see a potato gun ? just slice and dice the potato and you have the [[ORDINAL]] home made drone killer .
need a liberal drone pick up on [[PERSON]] ave please ! ! ! delivery to the middle of the bermuda triangle .
not sure if they 're programmed yet to pick up the trash .
lol
and , of course , the camera footage is a peeping tom 's biggest dream . fly [[CARDINAL]] over my property without my permission and you are trespassing ! enough of these things get shot down , and this lunacy will stop .
landing at wrong address ? in the [[GPE]] you can not shot them out of the sky , but if one lands in my yard i will beat it to death .
common sense tells you that this type of delivery system will never become productive .
well , i never thought i 'd see [[DATE]] that paying for bottled drinking water would catch on , either . let 's just [[ORG]] this does n't work out .
shotgun sales just went up ...
technology will intervene and porch pirates will be able to redirect drones to their own homes . it 'll be considered " green " since they wo n't have to drive around looking for packages to steal .
i am [[CARDINAL]] yrs old . i had made a career in the computer industry ( development , management , sales ) over [[CARDINAL]] yrs . i never dreamed society would be so changed in such a short period of time . i can only imagine the future .
wa wa waaa ... quityourbellyachen ...
bird shot . done .
" what do you want to be when you grow up ? " , asks [[PERSON]] . " i want to be a drone pilot and deliver coffee . " , says the boy . ugh .
is it legal to shoot them down when they 're over your yard ? i can see the ones carrying prescription drugs being the most popular targets .
jam the frequency and watch the crash .
most have a return to home function that allows them to return and land once signal is lost .
i like it .
i ca n't think of any way to annoy people more then this . the potential for accidents , intrusion , noise and so much more is all coming to fruition .
great ! free moving targets !
fishing line in trees can stymie some of them
okay kids , now that you 've got your shiny new [[GPE]] guns for [[DATE]] , let 's work on your aim ...
do you think a duck blind would look outta place in [[GPE]] ? just sayin '
a shotgun can solve the problem quickly .
i wonder what the law would say ? makes me think of " [[WORK_OF_ART]] , " with [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] characters sitting on the front porch shooting at traveling salesmen .
would have to catch you first and then provide evidence . in the meantime , you have a free gift if still intact .
which they will . to much effort and jail time risk for garbage
we are right behind you .
delivery drone manufacturers better come up with noise and emission standards to prevent a backlash .
you would think that there is someone somewhere who can redesign the rotors ( props ) on drones to re - pitch them or increase the chord so the motors can turn a bit slower and reduce the noise without reducing lift
lol , such a petty way to think
he sounds reasonable to me . business ' do not have the right to commit noise pollution . it is regulated like every other thing in this life .
‚Äú it is a suburb surrounded by [[PERSON]] " ? ? ? whew ! !
not all new ideas are good ideas .
these are garbage . they should be outlawed ....
you need to play catch - up with the future . it 's not your fault . blame those that raised you .
i will have to check , but i will send up barrage balloons as high as legally possible ....
another trend normal folks have to endure until the entitlement kids outgrow their toys .
trend ? this is the future , pal . wake up already .
they should make them fly over roads . flying over peoples yards is uncool
having to fly over roads kinda defeats the whole " [[WORK_OF_ART]] to point b " benefit of air travel , not to mention making collision avoidance virtually impossible when you create a small traffic corridor and funnel all traffic through it
tell that to the helicopters that fly over my house [[CARDINAL]] times a day .
oh no ... drones make noise ? oh the horror ! oh the inhumanity ! ! ! i guess we 'll have to ban police sirens now too .
