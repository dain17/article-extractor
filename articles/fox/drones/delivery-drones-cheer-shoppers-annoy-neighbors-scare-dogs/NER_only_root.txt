how well does a drone fly with [[PERSON]] lodged in its propellers ?
learn to use a slingshot
i wonder if they can drop me some dope off at my front door .
well , at least these drones would be good practice shooting for skeet shooters ..... just waltz out into your yard and cut loose with yer [[CARDINAL]] gauge ...............
[[ORG]] the noise bothers me [[ORG]]
if people were to shoot a few of these down then things would change .
‚Äú that damned old wheel will be the death of us ‚Äù says barny to fred .
time for some electromagnetic interference ?
does the drone knock on your front door or ring the doorbell ? does it drop your package from [[QUANTITY]] ? do drones get lost ? will they pick up a return ?
what we need is suppressors for shotguns .
the same was said about the automobile . i ‚Äôd like to think there ‚Äôs a way to integrate this correctly , but until that way is found it ‚Äôs likely to be annoying at best . time will tell .
[[CARDINAL]] more reason that i 'm glad i live on [[QUANTITY]] out in the country . could you imagine living in some crowded subdivision with those dam / n / ed things flying around all the time ?
very quaint . til ' someone gets an eye taken out by a drone blade . then it 's lawsuit city .
if someone is comparing the sound of a drone to the sound of a chain saw " gone ballistic " , they are exaggerating a little . no , they are not quiet , but they are n't that loud either . once they get above [[QUANTITY]] , they are difficult to hear at all and are about the same as a small plane flying overhead at [[QUANTITY]] . also , unless local sound ordinances are violated , homeowners will have difficulty fighting this . plus , the actual deliveries would last about 2 minutes out of your day . how much annoyance can that really be . before you try to damage [[CARDINAL]] or shoot one down , check your local laws and then check with the [[ORG]] . you may find you are going to be the one in trouble .
these things are a menace and should be banned .
obviously , [[NORP]] need their guns back so they can shoot down these drones ....
only in virtual gun - free [[GPE]] , of course ; in the [[GPE]] , those drones would acquire a fatal case of lead poisoning .
so if they are flying over your property , can you shoot them down ?
no good is going to come of this .
invest in some buckshot üòÅ üòÅ üòÅ
ca n't yet do this in [[GPE]] . [[ORG]] has not granted , or most likely will they ( at least i hope they do not ) , changes to laws necessary to all this .
shotgun ... thieves .
do drones fly inverted in [[GPE]] ?
at some point , lawmakers will have to look at this issue and define the legal parameters for creating micro - airworthiness routes . the drones do not go away and their use will be even more widespread . in the past rules were created to organize the displacement for cars , boats , airplanes , etc . now it 's time to do the same for the drones .
if it scares dogs into not barking , i 'm all for it .
skeet drone !
if it enters your property does nt that make it your property ? what about the land owners rights ? i do nt know its intention .... i m gon na shoot it down .
i would much rather listen to drones than a bunch of liberal whiners .
" get off my sky ! "
i call that arieal trespass and would shoot it down .
it 's going to make life easier for porch pirates once they install anti - aircraft weapons on their pirate ships .
sling shot is a new toy ! interesting anybody !
these become commonplace here , and i 'll have to cobble together some anti drone defenses for my house .
any drone flying over my property better be able to fly leaded , it 's posted so the drone was warned .
if you 've ever seen the movie wall - e .... that 's where we 're all headed . big fat blobs using our tablets to order things because it 's gotten too difficult to make a friggen cup of hot chocolate .
get a gps jammer .
i wonder if it 's legal to down a drone that 's flying over your property ? take one of those guns that shoots a large net to bring it down and then smash it to smithereens .
drones are fancy versions of remote controlled helicopters that we have had for [[DATE]] .
there need to be laws made regarding public arial thoroughfares that drones are restricted to . just as the [[ORG]] truck ca n't drive through my lawn to get to my neighbor 's house , so should drones be restricted to flyways .
we could shoot a sidewinder missile at it . wonder if that would do the job ?
you know what is going to happen . on the return flight the drone will be carrying a bomb .
depending on where you live ..... you own the [[ORG]] space above your land [[QUANTITY]] , anything under that is trespassing ..
i see a drone war coming . how long before someone puts a weapon on their drone and it takes down another drone ? game on !
do n't forget a drone has a camera and gps on board . so leave your property and wear a mask .
shame .... can't fire a real weapon in the city limits unless there is an actual threat to life . however , the beanbag gun will accomplish the same end .
the reincarnation of barrage balloons may soon become a reality . helium , balloons , fishing line , down they come . cheap , easy , 24/7/365 .
the public 's understanding of what drones are and do is woefully ignorant . ca n't tell you how many times someone thought i was spying on them because they could see and hear my drone a [[QUANTITY]] up . i 'd show them the pics and video i 'm taking and that normally puts their fears to rest . most drones that high up ca n't zoom in like that . unless it 's hovering outside your window , it 's likely the drone operator is not spying people .
there is no law against shooting a mechanical bird out of the sky .
pull ! ! ! trap shooting ? anyone ?
just make it legal to shoot them down with a slingshot , and it 's all ok .
lol i like to get a drone to deliver a pizza to my house and then a playboy magazine mwahahahaha !
in the future , you will buy your drone based on the caliber of it 's gun ( [[CARDINAL]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] , [[CARDINAL]] etc . )
although an airspace incursion may not be considered trespassing , the uninvited appearance of a drone operator , even to search for a missing drone is , and is illegal as such .
be a billionaire , invent a drone dope similar to fly dope .
a completely new way of doing a person in .
ever see a potato gun ? just slice and dice the potato and you have the [[ORDINAL]] home made drone killer .
need a liberal drone pick up on [[PERSON]] ave please ! ! ! delivery to the middle of the bermuda triangle .
and , of course , the camera footage is a peeping tom 's biggest dream . fly [[CARDINAL]] over my property without my permission and you are trespassing ! enough of these things get shot down , and this lunacy will stop .
landing at wrong address ? in the [[GPE]] you can not shot them out of the sky , but if one lands in my yard i will beat it to death .
common sense tells you that this type of delivery system will never become productive .
shotgun sales just went up ...
technology will intervene and porch pirates will be able to redirect drones to their own homes . it 'll be considered " green " since they wo n't have to drive around looking for packages to steal .
i am [[CARDINAL]] yrs old . i had made a career in the computer industry ( development , management , sales ) over [[CARDINAL]] yrs . i never dreamed society would be so changed in such a short period of time . i can only imagine the future .
wa wa waaa ... quityourbellyachen ...
bird shot . done .
" what do you want to be when you grow up ? " , asks [[PERSON]] . " i want to be a drone pilot and deliver coffee . " , says the boy . ugh .
is it legal to shoot them down when they 're over your yard ? i can see the ones carrying prescription drugs being the most popular targets .
jam the frequency and watch the crash .
i ca n't think of any way to annoy people more then this . the potential for accidents , intrusion , noise and so much more is all coming to fruition .
great ! free moving targets !
fishing line in trees can stymie some of them
okay kids , now that you 've got your shiny new [[GPE]] guns for [[DATE]] , let 's work on your aim ...
do you think a duck blind would look outta place in [[GPE]] ? just sayin '
a shotgun can solve the problem quickly .
delivery drone manufacturers better come up with noise and emission standards to prevent a backlash .
‚Äú it is a suburb surrounded by [[PERSON]] " ? ? ? whew ! !
not all new ideas are good ideas .
these are garbage . they should be outlawed ....
another trend normal folks have to endure until the entitlement kids outgrow their toys .
they should make them fly over roads . flying over peoples yards is uncool
oh no ... drones make noise ? oh the horror ! oh the inhumanity ! ! ! i guess we 'll have to ban police sirens now too .
