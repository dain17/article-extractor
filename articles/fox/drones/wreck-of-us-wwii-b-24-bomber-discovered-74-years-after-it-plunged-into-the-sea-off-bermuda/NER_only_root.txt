article is garbage . that wreck has been known by the dive community for [[DATE]] . i dove on this wreck as part of a commercial charter in [[DATE]] . i do believe the wreck may have been declared a war grave and diving is no longer allowed . [[ORG]] , the [[PRODUCT]] was empty when it crashed . it may have had an internal ferry fuel tank in the bomb bay . no munitions not even defensive machine guns
what does the wasp or the [[ORG]] have to do with the [[PRODUCT]] wreck ?
did you know we were at war with [[PERSON]] during [[EVENT]] ? ?
written on the side was " [[PERSON]] was here - 1943 "
my grandfather flew a [[ORG]] over [[GPE]] . he was [[DATE]] in charge of [[CARDINAL]] guys . scary . i wish i had gotten to talk to him as an adult about his experiences .
do n't mess with it . rip
my dad flew [[PRODUCT]] in ww2 . he said it was a hard workout with no hydraulics to assist with the flight surfaces ... like a loooooong trip to the gym .
film it . post it . restrict it . leave it alone .
read - it - yourself video . says the same as the article . what 's the point ? why not tell us how deep the wreckage was found ? i guess you did n't ask any questions ( but a real reporter would ... he would go after the story and get the details ) . sham " journalism " at its worst !
let it lay where it is . it is [[EVENT]] . rest in peace .
the wreck should remain as is . it 's a stark testimonial of the sacrifice of many brave [[NORP]] during [[CARDINAL]] of the darkest times in our history .
numbers please ! maybe a good fishing hole
why is a public university funding this ? is n't there a better use of tuition ? or maybe , tuition can be lowered .
author seems a bit confused , initially said was " heavily - laden " implying what ? that it had a full load of fuel , ammo and ordinance ? but in the next paragraph it says that it was making a " routine ferry flight to [[GPE]] " typically you do n't ferry bombers loaded with [[MONEY]] of high explosives ...
when i read these stories , it reminds me of the tremendous sacrifice of the greatest generation , my father and uncles included . thank you for your service to our nation , and for your sacrifice .
so the ufo 's did n't take that one into the mother ship .
now , if they could ever find flight 19
it is a grave site . leave it alone . keep tourists away from it . they will desecrate the site .
it sure would be nice if your so called " video " captions would n't cover up the pictures which by the way are repeated in the article . why have this so called video at all ?
another [[PERSON]] triangle victim .
[[PRODUCT]] was the most produced bomber of ww2 . [[PRODUCT]] stole all the glory but [[PRODUCT]] was the workhorse that got it done . we gave many to [[GPE]] and many were converted to [[ORG]] aircraft , hunting down [[NORP]] u - boats in [[LOC]] and bay of [[GPE]] . there is a restored one ( a rare a model ) at the local airport here in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] that sells rides during events . i see it flying over my house a lot .
[[PERSON]] invented airplanes .
[[PERSON]] invented all types of drones .
god bless the [[PERSON]] 's that built her and the men who flew her .
when they said " bermuda and bomber " i immediately thought of the flight of tbf avengers that was lost in the triangle . i m surprised nobody is looking harder in triangle .
those were some of the best boat 's ever builded
think this technology would help [[NORP]] find evidence for [[ORG]] 's collusion ?
they are all heros from the greatest generation ! never forget !
