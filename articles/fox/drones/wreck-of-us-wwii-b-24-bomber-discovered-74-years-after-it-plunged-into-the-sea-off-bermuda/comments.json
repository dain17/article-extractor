Do you really think no one on an island where sport fishing and dive charters are industrial mainstays. In heavily trafficked waters, commercial boat captains know every  shallow snag, every wreck . Think the dive is in 50 to 70 feet. But it has been a very long time. The wreck appears not to be featured. May be a war grave and diving is usually forbidden in such wrecks.",
