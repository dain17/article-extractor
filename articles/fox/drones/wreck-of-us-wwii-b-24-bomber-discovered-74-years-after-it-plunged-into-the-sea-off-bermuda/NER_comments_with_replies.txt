article is garbage . that wreck has been known by the dive community for [[DATE]] . i dove on this wreck as part of a commercial charter in [[DATE]] . i do believe the wreck may have been declared a war grave and diving is no longer allowed . [[ORG]] , the [[PRODUCT]] was empty when it crashed . it may have had an internal ferry fuel tank in the bomb bay . no munitions not even defensive machine guns
sorta like the " discovery of the new world " which the folks living there knew it all the time .
you sure this is the only b-24 that went down in that area ? just asking .
no but this one is in shallow water near the mouth of the bay . in [[FAC]] . do you really think no one on an island where sport fishing and dive charters are industrial mainstays . in heavily trafficked waters , commercial boat captains know every shallow snag , every wreck . think the dive is in [[QUANTITY]] . but it has been a very long time . the wreck appears not to be featured . may be a war grave and diving is usually forbidden in such wrecks .
what does the wasp or the [[ORG]] have to do with the [[PRODUCT]] wreck ?
the last [[CARDINAL]] of [[ORG]] " science " articles usually consist of a list of summaries of vaguely related news items .
it drives up the word count , they get paid by the word .
like trolls ?
what does reading comprehension have to do with your family ? nothing .
they are just compiling stories of recently found wrecks . is there a problem ?
yeah , since when were the [[GPE]] at war with [[PERSON]] during [[EVENT]] ? ?
grow up , [[ORG]] . please remove dixie from you handle . you insult the name .
nothing ; )
did you know we were at war with [[PERSON]] during [[EVENT]] ? ?
yes .... and [[GPE]] .
did you know that is one of the most nonsensical things i 've read in a long time ?
did you know there were [[NORP]] u - boats patrolling and sinking ships all along [[LOC]] during ww2 ?
yes , i knew it . i had to keep replacing shear pins in my kickers because of their snorkels and periscopes . can i sue ?
their were u - boats patrolling the gulf of [[GPE]] around [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] . sunk a large freighter ( [[GPE]] ) [[QUANTITY]] from [[LOC]]
[[LOC]] in [[LOC]] ? not !
google it , have you ever been to [[GPE]] island , the one near [[GPE]] , fl ? in [[LOC]] . i did n't think so . running your little whistle .
written on the side was " [[PERSON]] was here - 1943 "
keep it up [[ORG]] . we need to mention [[PERSON]] on every single article regardless of subject . this makes us look smart . # winning
[[PERSON]] was there when it crashed
[[PERSON]] filled the ocean up with a water hose and he invented the water hose ....
he did . but did you know he invented the hose after he filled the ocean with it ? ? ? true story . my grandpa told me so .
[[PERSON]] invented everything . even himself ...
and water .
my grandfather flew a [[ORG]] over [[GPE]] . he was [[DATE]] in charge of [[CARDINAL]] guys . scary . i wish i had gotten to talk to him as an adult about his experiences .
yes we took it for granted back then . my grandmother worked on [[PRODUCT]] 's back in [[GPE]] during [[EVENT]] . she took turns with her friend to help assemble the twin machine guns in the turrets . the factories were going [[TIME]] per day and they worked [[TIME]] per day each . the big outing of [[DATE]] was getting off to go to church on [[TIME]] to see my great grandfather preach at the old [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] .
my dad enlisted in [[DATE]] , shortly after his [[ORDINAL]] birthday , and spent [[DATE]] in [[LOC]] . before he died , we sat at the table and he gave me a [[NORP]] officer 's pistol , holster , and magazine , along with the signed paperwork from [[ORG]] approving it as a " [[NORP]] war relic " . i asked him where he got it , and all he would say was " [[GPE]] " . other than that he never spoke of his time there .
do n't mess with it . rip
my dad flew [[PRODUCT]] in ww2 . he said it was a hard workout with no hydraulics to assist with the flight surfaces ... like a loooooong trip to the gym .
my grandfather flew a [[PRODUCT]] with the [[ORDINAL]] af in [[GPE]] . my father used to brag about how strong [[PERSON]] was . i think you hit on the reason .
i have researched , but not confirmed that it was the largest aircraft to not have any mechanical assistance ( hydraulic / electric / whatever ) for the flight controls ... i 'd appreciate any confirmation / refutation . rip 1lt " dad "
there is a [[PRODUCT]] liberator that is still flying . it makes trips around the [[GPE]] every once in a while . i got a chance to fly / ride in it ( $ [[MONEY]] per person ) . biggest thing i noticed was the personnel were a [[ORG]] smaller back then .
i saw it at the air show in yuma [[DATE]] . there was an old zero , [[PERSON]] and a few others . not many left . as a kid in the west , [[ORG]] used old [[PRODUCT]] 's as borade bombers for forest fires back then . wish had paid more attention back then . pretty grand to see them lumbering low over town on their way to a fire .
film it . post it . restrict it . leave it alone .
read - it - yourself video . says the same as the article . what 's the point ? why not tell us how deep the wreckage was found ? i guess you did n't ask any questions ( but a real reporter would ... he would go after the story and get the details ) . sham " journalism " at its worst !
what would knowing the depth do for you ? make you sleep better ? as stated it crashed in a harbor . ca n't be that deep .
journalism is dead
let it lay where it is . it is [[EVENT]] . rest in peace .
what .... the war with [[PERSON]] ? ?
those who do not know or study history are doomed to repeat it . now go to your room and play with your woody .
yeah they kind of missed the sarcastic joke . we were and still are at war with the [[PERSON]] .
the death of a military member is never a joke !
hey [[PERSON]] come lately . your [[DATE]] behind and not sure of how my own comment came to be . me and my fellow military members joke about the deaths of our own friends . so preach somewhere else . rakkasans ! ! ! !
blame [[PERSON]] for the late . it just showed on my string . as for you and your military buddies joking about death ? that 's your thing . not mine . as for me , [[DATE]] [[ORG]] , served in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . and i believe that [[NORP]] where [[ORG]] . right ?
got the name in [[GPE]] but served unit served in every major operation since ww2
ok , got it . i remembered because i was in [[GPE]] and at that time ( 61,62 ) you had to wear class a khakis in [[DATE]] . some airborne guys in the unit would wear jump boots , wings , and glider patch on their overseas cap . the [[NORP]] would always call them [[NORP]] .
the wreck should remain as is . it 's a stark testimonial of the sacrifice of many brave [[NORP]] during [[CARDINAL]] of the darkest times in our history .
numbers please ! maybe a good fishing hole
a little respect is due to the [[CARDINAL]] airmen who did not survive .
[[CARDINAL]] airmen did not survive the crash . [[CARDINAL]] remain missing . their remains may be in the [[PRODUCT]] .
[[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] . that does not change the amount of respect that should be shown . as for the person that insinuated that they were on a " vacation " flight to [[PERSON]] , i submit that these bombers where regularly used on u - boat detection patrols . they would bomb any [[ORG]] spotted .
probably are
survive what , a vacation trip with [[PRODUCT]] or a wwii bombing mission of bermuda ? ?
why is a public university funding this ? is n't there a better use of tuition ? or maybe , tuition can be lowered .
found him ! [[PERSON]] is the guy who completely missed the point ! funny , most of the comments are from children and grand children of our warriors who flew these planes , and are very respectful and nostalgic .
actually you 're sixtylost .
ethnic culture in the movie industry would be a better alternative subject of study .
why do you care ? you dropped out after [[ORDINAL]] grade .
and their school mates are all paying for it .
voluntarily .
uh huh .
what , you think they were coerced into paying their tuition ? they had no choice ?
no , they were'nt " coerced " , they paid " voluntarily " .
no doubt students involved are learning more from this expedition than they will ever learn out of any book .
they were investigating [[EVENT]] [[PERSON]] this b-24 was on .
author seems a bit confused , initially said was " heavily - laden " implying what ? that it had a full load of fuel , ammo and ordinance ? but in the next paragraph it says that it was making a " routine ferry flight to [[GPE]] " typically you do n't ferry bombers loaded with [[MONEY]] of high explosives ...
how about heavily laden with fuel ? it takes a lot of fuel to cross the [[LOC]] !
when i read these stories , it reminds me of the tremendous sacrifice of the greatest generation , my father and uncles included . thank you for your service to our nation , and for your sacrifice .
so the ufo 's did n't take that one into the mother ship .
now , if they could ever find flight 19
or amelia earhart 's plane
or [[PERSON]] 's emails ...
or your real father .
it is a grave site . leave it alone . keep tourists away from it . they will desecrate the site .
it sure would be nice if your so called " video " captions would n't cover up the pictures which by the way are repeated in the article . why have this so called video at all ?
another [[PERSON]] triangle victim .
[[PRODUCT]] was the most produced bomber of ww2 . [[PRODUCT]] stole all the glory but [[PRODUCT]] was the workhorse that got it done . we gave many to [[GPE]] and many were converted to [[ORG]] aircraft , hunting down [[NORP]] u - boats in [[LOC]] and bay of [[GPE]] . there is a restored one ( a rare a model ) at the local airport here in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] that sells rides during events . i see it flying over my house a lot .
the [[WORK_OF_ART]] could carry a heavier bomb load faster than a [[ORG]] . that 's why [[ORG]] built so many . in a belly landing with the gear up , the [[PERSON]] would usually fracture behind the wing . and , the [[PERSON]] was a better looking airplane and would absorb incredible battle damage and still return to base . however , both did their jobs .
harder to fly , hydraulics were horrid , caught fire much easier as a result , harder to maintain and could not take the battle damage that the [[PRODUCT]] could . in spite of all of that , [[PRODUCT]] was good ; [[PRODUCT]] was great ..
hopefully not with a full bomb load .... took a ride on [[PRODUCT]] " out of [[ORG]] , [[DATE]] back .. was credited with downing [[CARDINAL]] me-109 's and damaged a [[ORDINAL]] .
[[PERSON]] invented airplanes .
[[PERSON]] invented all types of drones .
did n't he invent inventing ?
ha ha ! ! ! [[PERSON]] is a drone .
god bless the [[PERSON]] 's that built her and the men who flew her .
when they said " bermuda and bomber " i immediately thought of the flight of tbf avengers that was lost in the triangle . i m surprised nobody is looking harder in triangle .
would you ? i know i would n't go there unless i had to . lol
as a pilot for [[ORG]] , my grandfather flew over the bermuda triangle [[CARDINAL]] of times . there are multiple flights and shipping lanes that cross those waters daily with no incident .
... and that 's why there are as many wrecks as there are - because there 's lots of traffic there !
those were some of the best boat 's ever builded
literate much ? builded > > > lol , my son could do better than that in the [[ORDINAL]] grade
but [[CARDINAL]] is a little old for the [[ORDINAL]] grade -bah - dum - tiss ... i'll see myself out ...
think this technology would help [[NORP]] find evidence for [[ORG]] 's collusion ?
they are going to need witchcraft .
maybe dowsing rods ...
they already have tons of bitc .... [[PERSON]] ....
they are all heros from the greatest generation ! never forget !
tell rahm that this is when america was ever great ! the numb skull !
this [[ORG]] daughter / sister and mom thanks them for their service .
