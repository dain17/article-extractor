nothing a fully primed [[PERSON]] bank , and a spread of [[GPE]] torpedoes ca n't handle .
drones in space ! this is not your father 's r2d2 .
think about the electrical transmission grid .
i am fro [[GPE]] . this is exactly like the [[NORP]] drone . the whole idea of a massive drone attack confusing enemy ’s radars and jamming their electronics goes back to the 80s when [[GPE]] neutralized the [[NORP]] radars in [[GPE]] and then shot down some 80 [[NORP]] jets in [[DATE]] .
there is no defense . you can run , but you ca n't hide .
drone use against high value fixed targets such as oil refineries is completely different from their use in a battle field environment . defense against fixed target attacks is a problem increase of orders of magnitude . good luck [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] attack is an example showing that drones work .
[[PERSON]] !
see what gold does [[DATE]] .
star wars has arrived . soon to be on the market : faraday cages for your devices , large and small .
the world anxiety index just went up several notches .
small drones that crawl and can swarm on the battlefield will be incredibly effective for police actions .
do n’t worry . [[PERSON]] will ban and confiscate the drones .
i wonder when police will start using drones on bad guys ?
nuclear power plants are next .
yes , and they will have stingers in their tails too !
yikes , so we need a swarm of drones to fight an the enemies swarm of drones , so that soldiers are not attacked by an army of autonomous drones .
[[CARDINAL]] style bombing is much easier to implement then . on the ground level , murders can be carried out in stealth where the murderers are not at the scene at all and catching them would be next to impossible . drone terrorism ?
so pull the troops out of [[LOC]] then . let the drones take care of [[ORG]] and the rest .
its looks like we are going full star wars . i hate to think what is going on in space right now .
i see your drone ..... and i raise you an mq-5 hunter
but roadside bombs not so much
[[NORP]] news for [[ORG]] ...
i have drone - killing technology . it is made of lead that travels above [[GPE]] .
the idea of small , explosive drones utilizing protean instability in their targeting behavior would keep me up at [[TIME]] . what to do , how to defend ?
