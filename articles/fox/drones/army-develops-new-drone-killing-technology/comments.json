Probably 30 years behind now, with computer power increasing. We did all the work on the night vision with IBM computers that held (GASP!) 260 GB of data, were 20 feet long, 6 feet tall and used the same amount of power as the average household. Imagine what they can do with the available computing power and AI capabilities of 2019? My laptop now has 4 times the amount of storage as the old IBMs.",
