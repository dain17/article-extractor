i 'm a drone user and i use them for photography on my vacations in order to get different angled shots that i would not otherwise be able to get . i live within [[QUANTITY]] of an airport and i 've never had any trouble with the [[ORG]] , airport or anything else . i think there is a huge misunderstanding of what drones are , what they can do and how they are used . the biggest question i get from people is they want to know how much my drone can " see " when i 'm " spying " on them ... lol . i show them and let them watch and as a result i alleviate a lot of the fears and misconceptions they had about drones . i think this article is another piece designed to be anti - drone .
looks like the [[ORG]] will have to reduce the speed under 2000 ft to [[CARDINAL]] in case a drone hits the windscreen .
that is quite the hole . how about through a windshield , or a fuel tank in the wing ?
what about the birds . they are the ones causing all the damage . never heard of a small drone taking down a plane . sure it 's possible under the right circumstances . anyhow , perhaps it 's time plane manufactures build aircrafts to withstand bird strikes and small drone strikes . i assume that 's possible to a degree ...
we could build them like tanks , kind of like [[LOC]] . but then you lose cargo / passenger carrying capability and lose fuel efficiency . i think that drone manufactures should be required to install an automatic self destruct feature that can be activated by a manned aircraft 's transponder if it gets within [[QUANTITY]] .
they are already built as strong as possible .
you did not read the article !
you 're right . my bad ...
drone and propellers - bad news . if you are lucky you just lose your propulsion . if you are n't lucky part of the prop could break off , get unbalanced , and shake the engine off . jet fans ?
with the primarily plastic construction of the typical drone it would at worst cause a small nick , much like a stone strike during takeoff or landing . while a nick can cause an eventual problem it is almost never an immediate issue .
it only take one . who wants to volunteer be the [[ORDINAL]] to fly in a plane and hit a drone to find out if your theory of no damage works ?
now do the ' test ' with a [[PRODUCT]] [[CARDINAL]] - rotor drone . make sure it has all the optional stuff on it . including a fully charged [[ORG]] battery set . lipo batteries are great power sources , but have a habit of catching on fire when damaged . aircraft are built to withstand some damage . burning batteries inside a wing or cockpit though , are something else all together .
not to mention that you know like , all of the aircraft 's fuel is stored in the wing
sounds so unlikely as to be almost impossible but i remember reading about a [[PRODUCT]] ( a small , [[CARDINAL]] seat trainer for those of you who are earthworms ) taking a bird through the windshield near [[LANGUAGE]] . the student and her instructor were barely able to control and land the plane .
[[PRODUCT]] is doing good to do [[QUANTITY]]
how is this different than putting instructions on how to make a bomb on the internet ? i think terrorists can come up with enough kooky ideas on their own without feeding them more " how to " lessons .
terrorists use the dark web , you would n't believe how many " how to " advice is on there for the darkest of human practices .
i 'm sure the terrorists are grateful for this video .
absolutely stupid . hitting a plane that ’s traveling at [[QUANTITY]] with a drone ( [[ORG]] ) that has the capability of [[QUANTITY]] is nearly impossible . another attempt to scare the public and limit drone use .
and [[QUANTITY]] is slow for a airliner , cruising speed is more than twice that speed .
and drones have a difficult time maintaining lift above [[QUANTITY]] . so if you knew what you were talking about you 'd know that generally , below [[QUANTITY]] [[ORG]] is [[CARDINAL]] kias . and below class b it 's [[CARDINAL]] kias .
not a real good pilot if he is at cruise at the altitudes the drones generally operating at . you 'd see this kind of thing on approach /takeoff or being negligent filming aerial firefighting
if you knew how lightweight and thin the aluminum is that makes up a wing on a small plane , this would n't surprise anyone at all .
so let ’s move inboard [[QUANTITY]] then ... how about through the windshield . on the other hand ... planes at working altitude would presumably be out of drone capability when the human operating the drone is following the rules ... presumably .
omg did you see the damage that plane did to a [[MONEY]] drone , very similar to mine . those planes better stay outta my airspace . it could be catastrophic for my drone ! !
similar damage as a bird strike . do n’t be that guy .
sensationalist bs . i guess we have to go out and kill all the birds now , too . how about all the deer and coyotes that run across the runway at 5am just after [[LAW]] ?
i suspect it wo n't be long before one of these bigger drones sold to the general public will be carrying [[QUANTITY]] of [[ORG]] explosives through the door of a [[ORG]] room or some other enemy of this nation !
if you sat down and imagined the possabilities of what can be done , it is pretty terrifying .
i shoot down drones when they enter the air space above my property , they have no right being within my private property so much for the money you wasted haha . on another note i love watching slow mo videos !
shooting down drones ( [[ORG]] ) is against the law . you do not own the airspace above your property . it ’s a public domain , regulated by the [[ORG]] .
police in my area have not told me i am doing anything illegal , i own [[QUANTITY]] of land and if anyone wants to film on my land they can ask for permission , if not their drone will be shot down . i have posted signs stating such .
i would hate to be you when fsdo shows up at your door with the [[ORG]] in tow .
right ... maybe your the only exception . and [[PERSON]] is your sheriff , and the [[ORG]] are peeking at your ugly wife .
eh maybe its because i help my community out and donate to the police , not to sure .... no reason to be jealous and resort to whatever you are trying to imply there . you know you do n't need to reply to comments . come on down to [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] i live somewhat near there , ask the local police about reports of drones being shot down on private property somewhere near the mountains .. don't forget to bring your drone , you can post the video on some video sharing site or something .
a [[NORP]] drone swallowed up by a [[NORP]] ! " oh yeah " vote republican ! !
i can just see the terrorists wringing their paws in delight .
a [[PERSON]] will not do [[QUANTITY]] unless in a dive ... its [[QUANTITY]] plane . a few turbo versions might get close to [[CARDINAL]] .. speaking from memory .
i fly a mooney that will do [[CARDINAL]] . that 's [[QUANTITY]] . so in a slow decent , [[QUANTITY]] is easy . and this is not turbo charged . fix your memory or fly some newer stuff .
the most likely time for a collision is during the approach , when the plane will be low and in a descent . the approach is also the worst time to have an [[ORG]] , not much time to recover .
cruise speed ( flat and level ) for a [[PERSON]] is [[CARDINAL]] knots ..... which is [[QUANTITY]] add that to a drone that is moving at [[CARDINAL]] - 30 mph towards the plane .... and what do you get ?
now that they showed this video isis will get all kinds of new ideas
i think the chance of a drone hitting a wing edge is unlikely due to the air being pushed over and under the wing and the drone not having enough mass to overcome those forces . however a hit on other plane surfaces is quite possible .
super small risk that a plane flying at speed would be hit or would hit a drone like shown in " study " . wing is [[QUANTITY]] thick , while drone is [[QUANTITY]] top to bottom . in [[GPE]] , test was done with light plane wing , not commercial aircraft wing . most people are responsible with their drones , [[ORG]] just needs to enforce actively instead of relying on local police . where is the denial to enforce these rules , cops wo n't do immigration enforcement , so why is n't msm covering this .
msm likes to resort to fear mongering and lies instead , because they know that most of the population are drones to the system .
birds do the same thing ... ban all birds .
there 's nothing " devastating " about the drone strike . it 's no worse than if it got hit by a goose .
i still would n't want a goose hitting the plane either .
they did a test using a simulated bird and it cause more severe damage but they did n't post that one .
that 's very scary stuff , that drone may be the size of a bird , but imagen a flock of birds ( drones ) peppering the plane , it 's easy to do .
so it ’s obvious that this is to scare the public into agreeing to block individuals owning and operating drones so large companies like amazon and walmart to rule the skies with their drones over your home . also you wo n’t fly a drone that high unless you ’re a kid . which in that case you should t have one .
drone delivery programs are likely to be a bad move in well populated areas anyway . limited capacity , earthbound obstructions , crowded airspace , and wind gusts . but they 're good for what they 're good for . not having suitable applications and being familiar with aviation ( and perhaps most of the technology you can mount on one ) , no , i do n't have one .
if you 're flying an early [[PERSON]] at [[QUANTITY]] , you ve got bigger problems !
how come no one is talking about the damage the plane inflicted on the drone ? !
because drones are evil and we have no love left for them . evil drone . say it . ... see it sounds right .
it is not the devices that are to blame , it is the humans operating the devices . the same is true for cell phones . it is that lack of common sense on the part of the humans that are the danger .
well what would that do to the handling qualities ? there is already a law you ca n’t fly [[QUANTITY]] within [[QUANTITY]] of an airport . but there is a law not to use cocaine , how is that working .
um ... not sure . how 's it working for you ?
a [[PERSON]] ? , not a cheapo [[DATE]] [[PRODUCT]] .
who needs fighters . fill the sky with drones and watch the [[NORP]] and chinese fighters disappear . of course the reverse would work to . but a lot cheaper .
i 'm not sure i 'd call this article fair and balanced . yes , if you shoot a drone at a wing in a wind tunnel it will damage it . but the vast majority of drones are used for positive purposes . farmers use them to survey their fields , and they help them keep the use of chemicals to a minimum . that 's good for the environment , and it 's cost effective for the farmers . they perform various and sundry types of inspection jobs . they 're used in entertainment and sports for different camera angles . heck , drones were just used [[DATE]] to survey storm damage after the hurricane . and the list goes on and on . you have to look at both sides of the argument . that would be fair and balanced .
those are just the good drones that would never hurt anybody - well unless they turned on you . they are worried about the evil drones .
kind of reminds you of another inanimate object that gets a lot of bad press , does n't it . drones are n't going away , and as long as they exist , the possibility they 'll be misused also exists . so deal with the people who misuse them . but unfortunately personal responsibility seems to have gone out of style .
no , it does n't . bad drones are evil and are trying to take over the world . [[PERSON]] knew . he tried to tell us so they silenced him ...
wow . after watching this video i think they should definitely outlaw drones in wind tunnels . :-)
the vid does n't show what a [[QUANTITY]] wind would do to the hole once it was created .
or what happens when you have aeronautical load on the damaged wing , like the kind you would put on it trying to do an emergency decent and conducting the approach to the nearest airport ( if you were lucky ) .
looks a lot like how the planes flew into [[LAW]] . they completely disappeared inside them .
exactly like that ! well except they were n't tiny little drones and the towers were obviously not plane wings . oh and the airliners were full of jet fuel . oh and the buildings were stationary and much larger than a plane wing moving at 200+mph so not impossible to hit with a tiny little drone . oh and the buildings also were not flying in commercial airspace i do believe . so yeah exactly the same .
i did n't say exactly . it just had a very similar look and feel .
this is no worse than the bad guys in the [[DATE]] 's training [[NORP]] and pigeons to attack planes ...
goose trainers ? well personally 0 . i was in the pigeon division and i tell you what the goose division had it easy . spotting a guy carrying [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] and an aluminum foil covered umbrella is nothing . we caught all those guys in [[DATE]] . but the pigeons ... i have to admit , they are probably still out there . yup , every once in a while i hear them . they say " coocoo coocoo " .
we dealt with it then , we can do it again !
i want to know where i can get a drone that flies without rotors
your local hobby store ? as in " rc airplane " ? you can even buy jet engine powered rc airplanes , if you 've got enough money . a " drone " is just a [[PERSON]] aircraft .
this is totally unrealistic . the impact speed far exceeds the combined top speeds of the aircraft and drone and was aimed specifically at a weak point . also that level of damage would not take down the plane .
do n’t confuse them with reality .
do n't be dramatic . that will buff right out .
i do n't see any way around this problem . we have laws that should prevent this , but they do n't do any good if people do n't follow them .
how are the working on heroin after they took it off store shelves .
laws have never stopped crime from happening . it only punishes after the crime has happened .
some kids will drop rocks and concrete blocks off highway overpasses onto cars for fun . ya think maybe they might fly their drones near airport runways for fun ? i guarantee it . solution ? there is none .
its not the drone you need to worry about . its the quarter lb . of c4 that they will attach to it
nope . it ’s the drone i worry about . i ’ve dodged several already and had to delay several landings due to atc warnings of them being spotted near final . have yet to come anywhere close to any c4 .
as the video shows , kinetic energy will do the job . much of our [[LAW]] system relies on kinetic energy to destroy incoming icbms . look up raytheon and exoatmospheric kill vehicle .
i was never a [[PRODUCT]] fan anyway .
my guess is that none of the people making snarky comments here are pilots .
no , but i 'm a pilot and i occasionally stay at a holiday [[ORG]] .
oooo , must be a mainline guy . regionals do n't get fancy [[ORG]] . ;-)
a lot of paranoid people !
a lot of incompetent drone owners .
the genie is out of the bottle and this one ai n't going back in !
way to go baiting all the crazies with a new idea ... bad article .
answer : jets need lasers installed on their wings . alex : you are correct for $ [[MONEY]]
chances of flying a drone to the proper altitude and in the correct flight path to intercept a jet at [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] , [[DATE]] .
this test was not about drones hitting jets in class a airspace . it was about drones hitting ga planes . and the chances of that are pretty high in relative terms to hitting something while flying . i personally have dodged several drones and nearly every pilot i know has a similar story . a [[ORG]] doing [[CARDINAL]] way , a drone doing [[CARDINAL]] the other way ... time to declare an emergency and hope you can get on the ground before you have complete structural wing failure .
zero ? then how have [[CARDINAL]] drones impacted aircraft already ?
proof ?
let 's make cars that fly and then it will get really fun !
fake news ! !
is this really something we want to be showing the terrorists ?
you can probably bet that by the time we read stuff like this , the bad guys have known about it for [[DATE]] and probably longer .
they 're way ahead of this !
it 's headlining " devastating damage " but in real life , the damage has not been devastating at all . that being said , any damage to an aircraft is a huge concern . and at this point , drones have become more than just an annoyance .
if your rear end was sitting in the little ga plane when it was damaged from hitting a drone , you 'd be pretty devastated .
true . and my wallet / insurance would be more devasted - er .
i can imagine the big smile the [[ORG]] would get when thinking of the bill he 'd charge to repair it .
i do n't like drones ... it just seems like something creepy guys buy and play with . and thus far the guys i have met with them that get them out at lake parties etc .. have n't changed my opinion .
it should be illegal for drones to fly in the same corridors as airplanes .
max legal altitude for a drone is [[CARDINAL]] ft . ( [[ORG]] part [[CARDINAL]] )
there are only corridors in certain places and altitudes . [[ORG]] flight outside those areas can fly [[PERCENT]] i believe .
my neighbor flew his drone over my house and yard [[DATE]] while i was sun bathing . i have n't seen the drone since . i wonder why ?
.. because you 're [[CARDINAL]] lbs and he went blind ?
this is too easy , ( just kidding ) , nice shot .
your husband shot it down ? you lassoed it and it 's in your shed ?
lol to naysayers . [[CARDINAL]] : imagine a drone propositioned and the scution of a large jet engine . [[CARDINAL]] : imagine a swarm of drones . [[ORG]] said .
" tis but a scratch ! "
what are the odds that in a [[QUANTITY]] airspace a tiny drone can hit a fast moving target ? this study is fluff and misleading . university liberal nonsense .
considering i had to dodge 3 around an airport in [[PERSON]] in [[DATE]] - pretty damn good odds
google " drone swarm at olympics " . what are the odds [[CARDINAL]] out of [[CARDINAL]] drones can hit a fast moving target ?
so what is the point of the test ?
airplane wins ... drone loses ...
the drone threat is way overblown . once upon a time when a pilot saw an unidentified object in the sky as he passed it was called an unidentified object ... now every child 's balloon becomes a " drone " in the eyes of the pilot . i keep hearing about how dangerous it is to planes . so how many times has a small photography drone been struck by a plane .... [[CARDINAL]] times that 's how many .
