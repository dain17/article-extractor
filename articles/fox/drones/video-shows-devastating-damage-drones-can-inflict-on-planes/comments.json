That's good for the environment, and it's cost effective for the farmers.  They perform various and sundry types of inspection jobs.  They're used in entertainment and sports for different camera angles.  Heck, drones were just used last week to survey storm damage after the hurricane.  And the list goes on and on.

I live within 5 miles of an airport and I've never had any trouble with the FAA, airport or anything else.  I think there is a huge misunderstanding of what drones are, what they can do and how they are used.   The biggest question I get from people is they want to know how much my drone can \"see\" when I'm \"spying\" on them...LOL.    I show them and let them watch and as a result I alleviate a lot of the fears and misconceptions they had about drones.   \nI think this article is another piece designed to be anti-drone.",
