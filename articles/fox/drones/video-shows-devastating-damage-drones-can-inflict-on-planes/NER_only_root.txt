i 'm a drone user and i use them for photography on my vacations in order to get different angled shots that i would not otherwise be able to get . i live within [[QUANTITY]] of an airport and i 've never had any trouble with the [[ORG]] , airport or anything else . i think there is a huge misunderstanding of what drones are , what they can do and how they are used . the biggest question i get from people is they want to know how much my drone can " see " when i 'm " spying " on them ... lol . i show them and let them watch and as a result i alleviate a lot of the fears and misconceptions they had about drones . i think this article is another piece designed to be anti - drone .
looks like the [[ORG]] will have to reduce the speed under 2000 ft to [[CARDINAL]] in case a drone hits the windscreen .
that is quite the hole . how about through a windshield , or a fuel tank in the wing ?
what about the birds . they are the ones causing all the damage . never heard of a small drone taking down a plane . sure it 's possible under the right circumstances . anyhow , perhaps it 's time plane manufactures build aircrafts to withstand bird strikes and small drone strikes . i assume that 's possible to a degree ...
drone and propellers - bad news . if you are lucky you just lose your propulsion . if you are n't lucky part of the prop could break off , get unbalanced , and shake the engine off . jet fans ?
it only take one . who wants to volunteer be the [[ORDINAL]] to fly in a plane and hit a drone to find out if your theory of no damage works ?
now do the ' test ' with a [[PRODUCT]] [[CARDINAL]] - rotor drone . make sure it has all the optional stuff on it . including a fully charged [[ORG]] battery set . lipo batteries are great power sources , but have a habit of catching on fire when damaged . aircraft are built to withstand some damage . burning batteries inside a wing or cockpit though , are something else all together .
sounds so unlikely as to be almost impossible but i remember reading about a [[PRODUCT]] ( a small , [[CARDINAL]] seat trainer for those of you who are earthworms ) taking a bird through the windshield near [[LANGUAGE]] . the student and her instructor were barely able to control and land the plane .
how is this different than putting instructions on how to make a bomb on the internet ? i think terrorists can come up with enough kooky ideas on their own without feeding them more " how to " lessons .
i 'm sure the terrorists are grateful for this video .
absolutely stupid . hitting a plane that ’s traveling at [[QUANTITY]] with a drone ( [[ORG]] ) that has the capability of [[QUANTITY]] is nearly impossible . another attempt to scare the public and limit drone use .
if you knew how lightweight and thin the aluminum is that makes up a wing on a small plane , this would n't surprise anyone at all .
omg did you see the damage that plane did to a [[MONEY]] drone , very similar to mine . those planes better stay outta my airspace . it could be catastrophic for my drone ! !
similar damage as a bird strike . do n’t be that guy .
sensationalist bs . i guess we have to go out and kill all the birds now , too . how about all the deer and coyotes that run across the runway at 5am just after [[LAW]] ?
i suspect it wo n't be long before one of these bigger drones sold to the general public will be carrying [[QUANTITY]] of [[ORG]] explosives through the door of a [[ORG]] room or some other enemy of this nation !
i shoot down drones when they enter the air space above my property , they have no right being within my private property so much for the money you wasted haha . on another note i love watching slow mo videos !
a [[NORP]] drone swallowed up by a [[NORP]] ! " oh yeah " vote republican ! !
i can just see the terrorists wringing their paws in delight .
a [[PERSON]] will not do [[QUANTITY]] unless in a dive ... its [[QUANTITY]] plane . a few turbo versions might get close to [[CARDINAL]] .. speaking from memory .
now that they showed this video isis will get all kinds of new ideas
i think the chance of a drone hitting a wing edge is unlikely due to the air being pushed over and under the wing and the drone not having enough mass to overcome those forces . however a hit on other plane surfaces is quite possible .
super small risk that a plane flying at speed would be hit or would hit a drone like shown in " study " . wing is [[QUANTITY]] thick , while drone is [[QUANTITY]] top to bottom . in [[GPE]] , test was done with light plane wing , not commercial aircraft wing . most people are responsible with their drones , [[ORG]] just needs to enforce actively instead of relying on local police . where is the denial to enforce these rules , cops wo n't do immigration enforcement , so why is n't msm covering this .
birds do the same thing ... ban all birds .
there 's nothing " devastating " about the drone strike . it 's no worse than if it got hit by a goose .
that 's very scary stuff , that drone may be the size of a bird , but imagen a flock of birds ( drones ) peppering the plane , it 's easy to do .
so it ’s obvious that this is to scare the public into agreeing to block individuals owning and operating drones so large companies like amazon and walmart to rule the skies with their drones over your home . also you wo n’t fly a drone that high unless you ’re a kid . which in that case you should t have one .
if you 're flying an early [[PERSON]] at [[QUANTITY]] , you ve got bigger problems !
how come no one is talking about the damage the plane inflicted on the drone ? !
it is not the devices that are to blame , it is the humans operating the devices . the same is true for cell phones . it is that lack of common sense on the part of the humans that are the danger .
well what would that do to the handling qualities ? there is already a law you ca n’t fly [[QUANTITY]] within [[QUANTITY]] of an airport . but there is a law not to use cocaine , how is that working .
a [[PERSON]] ? , not a cheapo [[DATE]] [[PRODUCT]] .
who needs fighters . fill the sky with drones and watch the [[NORP]] and chinese fighters disappear . of course the reverse would work to . but a lot cheaper .
i 'm not sure i 'd call this article fair and balanced . yes , if you shoot a drone at a wing in a wind tunnel it will damage it . but the vast majority of drones are used for positive purposes . farmers use them to survey their fields , and they help them keep the use of chemicals to a minimum . that 's good for the environment , and it 's cost effective for the farmers . they perform various and sundry types of inspection jobs . they 're used in entertainment and sports for different camera angles . heck , drones were just used [[DATE]] to survey storm damage after the hurricane . and the list goes on and on . you have to look at both sides of the argument . that would be fair and balanced .
wow . after watching this video i think they should definitely outlaw drones in wind tunnels . :-)
the vid does n't show what a [[QUANTITY]] wind would do to the hole once it was created .
looks a lot like how the planes flew into [[LAW]] . they completely disappeared inside them .
this is no worse than the bad guys in the [[DATE]] 's training [[NORP]] and pigeons to attack planes ...
i want to know where i can get a drone that flies without rotors
this is totally unrealistic . the impact speed far exceeds the combined top speeds of the aircraft and drone and was aimed specifically at a weak point . also that level of damage would not take down the plane .
do n't be dramatic . that will buff right out .
i do n't see any way around this problem . we have laws that should prevent this , but they do n't do any good if people do n't follow them .
some kids will drop rocks and concrete blocks off highway overpasses onto cars for fun . ya think maybe they might fly their drones near airport runways for fun ? i guarantee it . solution ? there is none .
its not the drone you need to worry about . its the quarter lb . of c4 that they will attach to it
i was never a [[PRODUCT]] fan anyway .
my guess is that none of the people making snarky comments here are pilots .
a lot of paranoid people !
the genie is out of the bottle and this one ai n't going back in !
way to go baiting all the crazies with a new idea ... bad article .
answer : jets need lasers installed on their wings . alex : you are correct for $ [[MONEY]]
chances of flying a drone to the proper altitude and in the correct flight path to intercept a jet at [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] , [[DATE]] .
let 's make cars that fly and then it will get really fun !
fake news ! !
is this really something we want to be showing the terrorists ?
it 's headlining " devastating damage " but in real life , the damage has not been devastating at all . that being said , any damage to an aircraft is a huge concern . and at this point , drones have become more than just an annoyance .
i do n't like drones ... it just seems like something creepy guys buy and play with . and thus far the guys i have met with them that get them out at lake parties etc .. have n't changed my opinion .
it should be illegal for drones to fly in the same corridors as airplanes .
my neighbor flew his drone over my house and yard [[DATE]] while i was sun bathing . i have n't seen the drone since . i wonder why ?
lol to naysayers . [[CARDINAL]] : imagine a drone propositioned and the scution of a large jet engine . [[CARDINAL]] : imagine a swarm of drones . [[ORG]] said .
" tis but a scratch ! "
what are the odds that in a [[QUANTITY]] airspace a tiny drone can hit a fast moving target ? this study is fluff and misleading . university liberal nonsense .
so what is the point of the test ?
the drone threat is way overblown . once upon a time when a pilot saw an unidentified object in the sky as he passed it was called an unidentified object ... now every child 's balloon becomes a " drone " in the eyes of the pilot . i keep hearing about how dangerous it is to planes . so how many times has a small photography drone been struck by a plane .... [[CARDINAL]] times that 's how many .
