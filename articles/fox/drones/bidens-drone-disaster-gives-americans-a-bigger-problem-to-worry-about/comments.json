I say leave it to China to deal with them and simply create such a deadly national defense and a willingness to use it against nations that nobody would dare attack us. If a terrorist attack-on our nation is launched from a nation then that nation should pay the price. Maybe then these countries will start policing themselves of radicals.\n\nAnd our law agencies need to hunt down and incarcerate Antifa, Proud Boys, BLM and other organizations formed and designed only to create violence, chaos and unwanted change in our country.

It's the same reason they were not in fact legitimately elected to the offices they hold today.

The government could take away the family assets after putting the parent in prison.  \n\nIt seems to have been designed to lock away as many people of color for as long as possible. Even Washington Post noticed that, before they became a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party.\n\nWell, that would make sense. Dirty Joe worked with people like Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, James O. Eastland, Herman Talmadge to try to stop school desegregation and later on his crime bill. These guys were some of dirty Joe's segregationist friends who helped him with his Biden Crime Bill.\n\nSo why don't you good Democrats focus on what Joe Biden actually did accomplish: He designed the mass incarceration system. \n\nWhat you like to call \"systemic racism\".\n\nThen you all ran out to vote for white supremacist Joe Biden: Can you explain that?",

Among these are the requirement that military forces wear distinctive uniforms, carry arms openly, operate under a chain of command, and wear distinctive insignia of rank.  Militaries are also required to use the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve tactical objectives, avoid collateral damage to civilians and property, treat prisoners humanely, etc. \n\nIn \"asymmetric\" warfare, guerilla forces follow none of these rules.  This puts state-run military forces at a severe disadvantage.  Under the rules of many decades ago, an armed guerilla captured on the field of battle could be summarily shot.  Economic resources that support guerilla forces (farms, livestock, foodstocks) could be destroyed.  These tactics often (but not always) worked to win military victories over guerilla forces, but are now war crimes.\n\nThis presents a real dilemma for the US.  Our high-tech military has severe difficulty fighting an enemy that does not abide by the Geneva conventions, while world opinion demands that we do.  \n\nMy advice: don't get involved in asymmetric wars where our morality and laws put us at a great disadvantage.  Such wars are always wars of choice, not existential wars.  E.g., our decision to invade Afghanistan was a choice, not an imperative for national survival.",

Not only did we lose our best/closest base to China, we've also made it a lot easier for Russia and China to expand their influence, precisely because the world sees us differently now.
