ok , i 'm a bit frustrated by superficial reporting from every [[ORG]] source on these downed drone stories . where 's the wreckage ? ! in this case the drone is said to have been a mere 1000 yds from our ship , so photo evidence should be a virtual arms length away . where 's the photo ? in the case of our own downed drone , we say that it was shot down in international waters but we ' have not found anything ' in the way of wreckage yet the [[NORP]] navy has displayed [[CARDINAL]] of pieces of the wreckage . could it be because the drone was downed in [[NORP]] territory as they said , making access to the wreckage off limits ? sloppy follow up reporting . homer reporting , too i suspect .
the [[NORP]] government has internet access . would it not be prudent to keep them guessing as to the exact method used to dispatch their drone ? it is very possible they did n't even use a jammer , but want [[GPE]] to think they did . a picture could relay too much information .
when i served the last person i was explaining my actions too was you !
or the [[ORG]] simply did n't care to waste the time and resources to scoop up trash out of the sea . there is presumably very little intelligence value to be gathered from analyzing the debris of such a rudimentary drone . probably not worth the risk to life and limb to go after it . also the [[NORP]] and sailors are not cameramen , nor can they just whip out their cellphone and capture any footage they like . they may or may not have had a [[CARDINAL]] with them on the float , and even so , it does n't guarantee that they are invited to record every single thing that happens . i imagine that when a drone is being operated around a ship , presenting a threat , you 'd want to keep all non - essential personnel off the deck . just because they do n't have a video does n't mean it did n't happen . shooting down a cheap drone is not a precursor to some vast conspiracy .
honestly , nothing personal intended in my reaction to what you say , but , what you are saying is lame reasoning . there is a heated differing in accounts of conflict by these [[CARDINAL]] sides , and only the [[NORP]] have provided video and material evidence of their accounting . when credibility is at stake , you provide evidence to back up your claim . again , why do n't our media show just an ounce of curiosity and ask for evidence ? [[PERSON]] . that 's how we made our way into an invasion of [[GPE]] , and [[GPE]] , for that matter ...
most people , including the international community , have come to learn over [[DATE]] to trust the credibility of the [[GPE]] over [[GPE]] . the purpose of [[GPE]] 's activities were clearly to make us look bad . you ca n't do so without filming , so they took the time to film . the purpose of our activities were to defend the airspace immediately around a ship operating freely in international waters . filming the event was probably the last thing on their mind while they responded to the threat . no vast conspiracy there ... [[GPE]] also said it " helped " a [[ORG]] ship that was having " trouble " , and then " detained " another ok ship supposedly involved in some sort of incident . that is far more suspicious than the [[GPE]] saying we downed a drone . [[GPE]] is actively testing our limits in the straight of hormuz . why would it be so far fetched to believe that they were buzzing our ships in international waters with cheap unmanned drones , and we did nt care to film our response ?
" most people , including the international community , have come to learn over [[DATE]] to trust the credibility of the [[GPE]] over [[GPE]] . " that is debatable . [[DATE]] ought to make that more clear if there are more of these incidents with no evidence offered by the [[GPE]] . you really must really be too young to remember the [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] national experiences , even broken treaties with [[NORP]] , etc . we have a long history of lying and backing out of agreements , sorry to report . is being so " patriotic " that you believe we can do no wrong and are always the ' good guys ' in a conflict a virtue ? really ?
last time i checked , the military does n‚Äôt owe you any kind of proof . hey are there to do a job , not pander to some kind of doubter .
i am a veteran of the wars in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . a former officer in the [[ORG]] . i agreed with the war in [[GPE]] . i did not support the war in [[GPE]] . regardless i deployed to both . i am well aware that [[GPE]] is not perfect , but we are still great . and far better than the likes of [[GPE]] ! ! feel free to do some research and compare the history of [[GPE]] 's misdealings ( both with the international community and it 's own citizens ) versus the [[GPE]] . if you still think [[GPE]] is more credible , you are hopeless . go ahead and move there if you have so much respect for them over the [[GPE]] . i 've spent a lot of time " living " in that region and i can assure you , you will not like what you find .
maybe i 'm missing something , but if the [[NORP]] drone was disabled in [[ORG]] , would n't that mean it sunk somewhere in the [[LOC]] ? i do n't doubt [[GPE]] could take pictures of a busted - up drone , and say it was the one in question .
do n't confuse some western powers supposedly " trusting [[GPE]] " , with their wishful , even fearful thinking .
are you sure these are the correct pics ? it looks more like the light and sound equipment from a [[PERSON]] concert ?
good concert , in [[DATE]]
i like your name and sadly , i had to miss that concert ( but i did see [[PERSON]] in [[DATE]] ) .
lol ! another great one ! [[PERSON]] for [[ORG]]
too cool ! !
i heard it comes with a crayon dispenser so the marines operating it do n't have to break to get chow .
burnt sienna tastes the best
my favorite was chartreuse .
[[ORG]] are soo [[ORDINAL]] century . [[GPE]] has developed a [[ORG]] that has a range of [[QUANTITY]] ) that fires [[CARDINAL]] rapid pulses down the path of incoming [[ORG]] , and their launch platforms . the effect is that electronics and electricity ceases to exist instantly , in the [[PERSON]] and the launch platform , be it a manpad , [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , or [[ORG]] . the [[ORDINAL]] [[CARDINAL]] just disable [[EVENT]] forever , but do no harm to the crews , however the loss of propulsion and all electronics , in a helicopter or aircraft result in crashes , which will highly likely result in death of the crew . though not deployed yet , it will be a standard missile defense system on all [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] [[PRODUCT]] and [[PRODUCT]] armored vehicles per jane 's defense . the " armata " advertisements call it a " directed energy weapon " but it is actually an " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
anti - emp hardening is almost as ancient as [[ORG]] 's . [[ORG]] spoofing is equally as old as [[ORG]] . the [[NORP]] system will probably work for [[TIME]] then it too will be " gone " . this stuff is what " dumb " weapons are for . remember , if you are in sight , even electronically , you are in range .
very cool !
that explains why it took so long before taking down the drone . the ship carries [[CARDINAL]] troops and supplies for ground war and they had to bring this unit from the hold and set it up .
so we knocked down a [[MONEY]] [[NORP]] drone with a [[MONEY]] jamming system mounted on a $ [[MONEY]] warship ( plus cost of man hours , fuel , etc . ) in retaliation to [[GPE]] shooting down our $ [[MONEY]] m drone ? so much for financial accountability .
had nothing to do with retaliation . it was because their drone got too close to our ship .
do you enjoy your freedom donkeybutt ? ?
please tell me exactly how our troops occupying foreign countries in any way adds to my freedom . to the contrary , i am forced to pay way more taxes for way less benefit to keep troops and equipment deployed . freedom .
just as financially sound as [[GPE]] spending [[MONEY]] per year for educating illegal aliens ( costs which do not include , health , housing , welfare , judicial / incarceration , lost wages to [[NORP]] labor force , loss of taxes to government for under - the - table cash , loss of economic stimulus as these cash wages are sent home , et al ... ) ? need i go on ?
apart from the fact that education - for immigrants , legal or illegal , as well as citizens - is an investment with a return which ends up being a net gain . immigration - both legal and illegal - also provides an increase in economic activity ( granted there are some winners and losers but that is the way things go ) . you may want to get your economic facts straight .
please tell me where my facts are incorrect . by the way , i am for legal immigration . so is every conservative i know .
i suppose they could have let the drone in to drop some virulent biological onto the ship full of sailors . that would probably satisfy your concern .
would not need to be there at all had the occupant kept his ego in check and not pulled out of the standing multi - national agreement . so much winning .
if terrorists could get this jamming system , they could take down commercial airlines near airports . any new state of the art weapon made by the military usually ends up with a civilian version also .
why ? have they run out of missiles ?
and i ‚Äôm sure you would have complained about the cost of the missile if they had used one .
this is a lot cheaper
why spend $ firing a missile when you can just flick the switch ?
maybe even recover the drone with minimal damage .
hey , [[GPE]] , presidents [[PERSON]] and obama were anomalies , [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] are reality
excellent . now install them on [[GPE]] commercial vehicles as well . üòè
for ever measure there 's a counter - measure . always thought the radio tether to a drone was a fragile link of control . nothing will beat hands - on .
it 's funny [[NORP]] probably watch videos of [[EVENT]] to gauge contemporary [[NORP]] capabilities .
if they do their looking at history . our military [[DATE]] is much different . [[GPE]] might as well be studying [[EVENT]] ! !
way to go boys ....
[[MONEY]] gun shots down $ [[MONEY]] drone .
do you not think it would have a similar effect on a much larger target , say a helicopter ?
nope , did not think that for a [[ORDINAL]] .
the drone is remotely controlled the helicopter is not ! ! !
how much was the drone again ? source ?
we should have vaporized the [[NORP]] jet that flew even closer to [[CARDINAL]] our assets .
the system is installed on [[ORG]] all - terrain vehicles and typically used on the ground , but recently the [[ORG]] has been putting it to the test on ships . uh , we need to get them installed on [[ORG]] too !
seems the [[NORP]] were smart enough to use a low dollar drone to analyze our [[MONEY]] signals . [[ORG]] not bright enough to figure this out .
good thing you ‚Äôre around to keep them on the straight and narrow . what a relief !
and just how did they analyze it [[PERSON]] ?
how do you know how cheaper the [[NORP]] drone was and them knowing about this capability does not matter as it is not secret and they ca n't defend against it .
i think that 's awesome , het [[GPE]] jam it !
are military always has the coolist toys . thank you president [[PERSON]] for being proud of our troops .
again , you are missing the point ; if the system can bring down a drone do you not think it would have the same impact on a helicopter , plane or guided missle ?
if it was controlled from a distant position maybe so .
drones are controlled with external transmissions , which can be easily detected and are virtually impossible to harden against outside interference . you can encrypt the signal , but you can not protect it . planes , etc . have no such vulnerabilities
drones are remotely piloted - planes and helicopters are n't
[[MONEY]] military industrial system defeated by a [[ORDINAL]] world country . remember [[GPE]] ? ?
judging by some of your other comments you do not seem very [[NORP]]
this happens we when use half measures and play by the rules our enemies do not
yeah , we won on the battle field , lost in the halls of [[ORG]] . thank the [[NORP]] .
so now we 're even . they splashed one of ours . we splashed one of theirs . now can everyone just go home ?
nope , our [[ORG]] 's job is to enforce freedom of navigation in international waters so that our merchant ships and those of our allies can ply those waters in support of international trade .
i dunno . have the measurements been taken ?
[[GPE]] ' the sting , [[GPE]] ? get some 3d laad bn !
i wonder if [[GPE]] is manufacturing knock - offs yet ...
bought the chips from [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] was n't happy with their knock off predators . buyers remorse .
i 'm sure the [[NORP]] are supplying them with the blueprints .
[[PERSON]] ... great job ! !
not sure it works very well . i saw video of an [[NORP]] drone videoing the ship for [[TIME]] .
we sleep very well at [[TIME]] since president [[PERSON]] is at the helm . thank [[PERSON]] .
i would love to be a fly on the wall to the conversations that are happening in the back channels . i suspect that there is a major conflict going on inside of the [[NORP]] leadership . they fully know that they are a hair trigger away from having their entire coastal defenses and [[ORG]] completely destroyed . the only reason something has n't happened yet is because our [[PERSON]] is getting intel that this is a show and not real .
taking down their coastal defenses would be a great test of the agm-88 missile . we already proved we can take down their drones easily and cheaply , time to show them what happens if they go too far .
you ai n't seen nothing , yet .
[[DATE]] the left was saying we did nt down an [[NORP]] drone , because the [[NORP]] said so .
now let 's deploy the anti - liberal system in [[GPE]]
well done !
to put in very simple terms , if it did n't work or take down a [[NORP]] drone , " then [[GPE]] would n't be talking about it " ! !
just imagine the tech they do n't let you see .
ca n't wait for the flying insect killers
or real killer tomatoes .
so now [[GPE]] will have have to send another terminator back in time to stop this technology from being built .
i want one . in my back yard . now . it 'll look good next to the [[PRODUCT]] .
yep . the military keeps the best stuff hidden until its needed . who knows what more incredible gizmo 's are waiting the day they are needed .
very cool .
will it take down [[PERSON]] or direct them off course ?
anything remote controlled is at risk .
" i want a warhead of my own "
you know the guys were super excited to use it for real after training for [[DATE]] .
nobody wants to go into combat but it is always good to have a positive weapons check beforehand .
betcha it would make one awesome bug zapper . bzzzt .
with all the frequencies that thing produces it 's like turning a giant commercial grade microwave oven inside out . it will probably cook any carbon based items if they get too close during operation .
it suits them to show off this technology now ..... however , they wo n't make a peep about the sound based deterrent weapons they have [[QUANTITY]] from the [[GPE]] / [[GPE]] border that could be used to stop illegal immigration . the new pc [[NORP]] only care about the me and not so much the [[GPE]] .
i think this is great , we need to be open and transparent on all our weapons systems . our enemies have the right to know what we have . they do n‚Äôt need to hack our computers to get the information they just need to watch [[ORG]]
" a defense official told [[ORG]] . " any other complaints ? just kidding ; we know you have an unending list of complaints .
[[ORG]] has guarded their new corvette more than this
oh yeah , with the info provided here , anybody could build one of these with stuff they got from [[ORG]] going out of business sale .
reminder to all enemies of [[GPE]] : in [[DATE]] no one knew anything of the atomic bomb until it was dropped on [[GPE]] . in [[DATE]] no one knew anything of the stealth bomber until ' shock and awe ' was unleashed on [[GPE]] . the [[GPE]] has a long history of quietly developing ' impossible ' weapons and when the moment is right using them on an unbelieving enemy . [[GPE]] will always be what [[PERSON]] promised in [[DATE]] : [[ORG]] . [[GPE]] is courting it 's own destruction .
even a [[NORP]] radio signal is deadley
let ‚Äôs start with this . we went to the moon [[DATE]] .
i was hoping the moongasm was over for awhile .
right ? so we went to the moon ... big deal . maybe it was a big deal [[DATE]] , but now my phone is more technologically advanced than the computer systems used when we went to the moon . yawn ..
so the next time they send someone to the moon you 'll volunteer because [[PERSON]] it 's no big deal try suiting up yourself and see if you can control your bowels on takeoff .
i wish you 'd go back where you came from !
next , we need a satellite system that will jam the frequencies of a launched missile and send it back where it was launched from .
it is very possible we already do , stay tuned ...
cost effective even . high dollar drone downed for pennies .
[[GPE]] did the same thing .
they used a surface to air missile , i ca n't speak of their cost to buy and deliver . the most used [[ORG]] surface to air is a modified air to air missile the aim 9 our cost educated guess in excess of a $ [[MONEY]] .
how much do you guess this jammer cost ?
[[CARDINAL]] , reuseable too .
that never happened ...... [[GPE]] used a surface to air missile .... not a jammer . pay attention
soon drones will be equipped with anti anti - drone capabilities .
and then anti drone units will get [[PRODUCT]] drone technology . is that right ? [[ORG]]
that is impossible as [[GPE]] and the [[NORP]] commrads , [[ORG]] , say it never happened
" what 's the frequency [[PERSON]] ? "
the military can excel when the president has the best interests of [[GPE]] as a priority . [[PRODUCT]] were simply a disaster .
[[ORG]] ! !
[[GPE]] , an emp for radio frequencies . this technology will work until ai pilots the drones without man flying them .
excellent
