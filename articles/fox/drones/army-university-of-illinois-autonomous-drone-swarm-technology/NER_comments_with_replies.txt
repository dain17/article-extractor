this is great . i worry that we 're prolly behind [[GPE]] in this aspect , but glad to see we are working on it . question ? - why should they hover while recharging ? that just uses juice . why not land and charger " remote " like phones do ?
solar .
hey [[PERSON]] . i think you need to reread the article . the drones will charge off of a vehicle . if they relied upon solar they either would n't need to land , or would have to land for [[TIME]] to charge .
i know . you know . my post was meant to be humor and a dig at [[PERSON]] 's green deal . [[PERSON]] will mandate all [[GPE]] weapons must be wind or solar powered . tee hee hee .
ahah ! sorry . long long day [[DATE]] . it went right over my head ... be well . be safe !
everybody knows the importance of [[GPE]] in [[DATE]] . if we are talking about artificial intelligence , there is only one name comes in my mind , [[ORG]] pallapothu . he is specialized in artificial intelligence .
drone warfare will be interesting and very damaging to humans . i 'm sure it will happen . the bad stuff always gets used once it has been developed . stones , sharp stones , knives , swords , muskets , rifles , tanks , airplanes , chemical bombs , nuclear bombs , icbms , drones , drones with bombs , drones with nuclear bombs , drones with lasers , drones with rail guns , satellites for surveillance , drone satellites with bombs and drone satellites with nuclear bombs , drone satellites with " lasers " . just wait long enough and humans will use all of this stuff against other humans . we have no choice but to develop this stuff because , if our side does n't , the other sides will .
wwiii is going to be drones the size of microbes that flock together and ca n't be stopped even by masks . oh , wait . . .
artificial intelligence meets weaponized drone swarms . what could possibly go wrong ?
[[GPE]] . it ‚Äôs not just another 80 ‚Äôs sci - fi movie .
do n't the military watch the movies where the good guys always take out the mothership to stop all the drones in their tracks . i know the bad guys watches the same movies .
they sure do waste money on stupid projects , how about remote ground hogs that dig and blow up with someone comes near them .
so , we are building [[FAC]] and will now need [[LOC]] . ü§ñ üëæ üõ∞ Ô∏è üöÄ
[[ORG]] would fix this would n‚Äôt it ?
i was wondering if this would work as a method of fighting locust swarms ?
[[GPE]] .... the implications of succeeding in this would be a game changer in many other industries .
just because we can does n‚Äôt mean we should .
please explain that rationale to [[GPE]] / [[GPE]] / [[GPE]]
how about refueling drones that bring a fresh battery directly to the swarm ?
..... or why not they just land in a safe zone , unfold their mini solar wings , recharge and then go back to the battle field ?
cool . i like it .
if they recharge by proximity , then this is easy . need a giant flying battery pack .
[[GPE]] already stole that technology . they are fitting them with chemical agents and biological weapons . they did not sign the treaty ban after [[ORG]] . matter of fact they have killed [[CARDINAL]] on the sly .
you really need professional mental health treatment .
so you are a [[NORP]] agent ?
you guys ever watch any of these [[WORK_OF_ART]] movies ?
[[ORG]] ? i expect to see anti - military activists protesting at the campus in [[CARDINAL]] ... 2 ... 1 ...
if we actually get these drone swarms , the army , the navy , the air force and the marines are dead as a dodo bird . none of the present force structure would withstand an attack by such a swarm . as to the wireless recharge claim , that is a radio , a very powerful radio if one is charging a lot of drones which makes it a good target for a cruise missile attack . why are they going for battery power , a fuel cell would allow much longer dwell times and flight times than any battery around ?
noise and heat signature will make the drones easier to target ...
a bunch of drunk [[GPE]] boys would knock them off in [[CARDINAL]] mins .
[[ORG]] truth
after they perfect this , [[GPE]] can do a remake of " [[WORK_OF_ART]] . "
it 's coming down to our bots against their bots !
watch the flick " [[PERSON]] has fallen" ... scary scenario
oh god here come the protests and defund requests towards the university for helping the [[ORG]] kill [[NORP]] , minorities and [[ORG]] . i can see it all now on [[ORG]] : the riots , the looting , the chants , the fires and insanity .
universities are useless ... lol , who needs science and higher education , [[PERSON]] the [[ORG]] can do better ..
and [[PERSON]] the builder .
drone swarms already exist . they have bombed [[NORP]] oilfields in [[DATE]] . a hydrogen fuel cell has over 100 times the flight time of an equivalent battery . replacing fuel charges would be quick and would not require a ground station readily blown to bits by any microwave guided drone . if the [[ORG]] is funding this , then we are truly in trouble .
hi [[PERSON]] . this is interesting . do you have an source articles which could back up this conclusion ? are there drones operating on h [[DATE]] ? ? ?
[[PERSON]] fuel cells exist , but they are most definitely a work in progress . also , under current restraints , while [[PRODUCT]] of times flight life does sound nice , current systems are only quadrupling flight life with best results .
