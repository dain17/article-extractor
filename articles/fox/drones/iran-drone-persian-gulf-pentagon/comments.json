Millions of Israel are targeted daily by the Iranian proxy terrorists who get paid heftily for killing as many Jews as possible based on the Iranian ideology of death and destruction. Netanyahu is supporting direct vote between him and Gantz which will probably making him the next PM. The attempt of the liberal media led Arutz 12 together with police leakers with financing and support of the American Democrats and the NY Times to take out PM Netanyahu with continuous false accusations in similar to the false-witnessing, ‘whistleblowers’ ‘Dossier’ that are used by the Democrats and the Clintons to take out President Trump without elections. Nevertheless, Israel cannot establish a government during more than half a year because of false accusations of Netanyahu. Minister Ohana is right to stand up to the coup attempt by the Israeli investigating police department, using forced false witnessing against Netanyahu loyal advisor Nir Hefetz and his family. Liberals, fascists and socialists in Israel adopted the communist rule of the KGB that everything is allowed to get to political power that brings them tons of money.",

Besides, as much as i hate to admit it, they are right to be angry at us. We toppled their democracy that they had fought for for over 100 years and imposed a brutal king on them. Then went ahead and gave Saddam Hussein the green light to invade and use chemical weapons on them. Shot down their civilian airliner from their own territorial waters, and are now demanding that they give up their only means of defense (missiles) and nuclear enrichment (which they have the right to under the NPT (this is different than the nuke deal btw)) and we are specifically targeting the most vulnerable of them by economic sanctions that have cut off  supply of life saving meds and food.",
