we could probably call drone design " neo - steampunk " . contemporary look , but with an unquestionable steampunk thought process behind them . they 're really nothing new at all . until we come up with a design that is actually new and functional , there will continue to be numerous problems .
[[ORG]] will start advancing payload capabilities of drones to get stuff over the border .
the drone revolution has barely started . they will be a transformative technology . like or or not , they will be everywhere soon .
i 'm going to start saving now to buy the [[ORDINAL]] commercially available [[CARDINAL]] - seater that comes on the market .
what ms. [[PERSON]] needs to identify is the costs savings from [[GPE]] . if i understand the long term consequences , the wealthy will fly above the poor on roads that are lacking funding for proper maintenance . we collect many billions in gas tax revenues [[DATE]] but our roads and bridges still suffer the effects of wear and tear due to age . a drone will fly effortlessly above the pot holes and get the travelers to their destination easily . no roads or bridged needed . granted they may use conventional gasoline engines to power the props , but i suspect their ability to fly a straight line from point a to point b means they 'll be more economical to run . meanwhile " drivers " still connected to the ground will zig - zag their way through traffic to get to their destinations .
