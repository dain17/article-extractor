        "context": "What Ms. Chao needs to identify is the costs savings from Drone Usage. If I understand the long term consequences, the wealthy will fly above the poor on roads that are lacking funding for proper maintenance. We collect many billions in Gas tax revenues annually but our roads and bridges still suffer the effects of wear and tear due to age. A Drone will fly effortlessly above the pot holes and get the travelers to their destination easily. No roads or bridged needed. Granted they may use conventional gasoline engines to power the props, but I suspect their ability to fly a straight line from point A to point B means they'll be more economical to run. Meanwhile \"drivers\" still connected to the ground will zig-zag their way through traffic to get to their destinations.",

They're really nothing new at all.\n\nUntil we come up with a design that is actually new and functional, there will continue to be numerous problems.",
