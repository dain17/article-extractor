They know they are on the side of wrong and evil. Once the bombs started falling and their leaders scrambled, they begged us to take them hostage. They are poorly led, unpaid, underfed and unmotivated. They  have viertually zero capability to strike at distance with any accuracy.  How did that \" years long war\" work out? Days, thats how.
