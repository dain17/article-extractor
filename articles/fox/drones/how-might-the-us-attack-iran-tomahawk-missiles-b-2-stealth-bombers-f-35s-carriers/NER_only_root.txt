if you had seen what i seen in [[GPE]] , and a lot of men will back me up on this , you would said get the popcorn and beer this is going to be fun .
we can soften them up with airpower but a full scale invasion would be an absolute disaster for the [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] is twice the size of [[GPE]] and while [[GPE]] is flat , [[GPE]] is mountainous . it 's a paradise for guerrilla warfare .
it may make for interesting reading but i think unless [[GPE]] attacks targets in the [[GPE]] , we are not going to be sending ground troops into [[GPE]] . we do n't need another [[GPE]] . if we need to destroy them , we can do it by air . and do n't get into an " nation building " this time .
" let me count the ways . for the ends of being and ideal [[ORG]] . most quiet need , by sun and candle - light "
hey ... i know a couple of guys who could easily take care of this whole situation ... street names are " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " and [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . no worries ...
spin the wheel of armament choices and let 'em rip ! pres t 2020 ! ! ! !
how might we attack ? let me count the ways .................
i love it when the military has a venue to be a proving ground for its weapons . [[GPE]] is a great place to test our weapons against the enemy .
just do it
hey fox , quit running war sims for [[GPE]] . let them figure it out on their own reconnaissance ..
bomb their land with pig carcasses ...
hit their oil delvery systems along the coast hard . they need the money . gets em right in the bread basket . few collateral casualties . they can use obamas gift money to rebuild . then hit it again . no money for nukes .
same big talk used for [[GPE]] .. [[DATE]] . low tech enemies give us problems .
does n't anyone recall president [[PERSON]] 's attack on [[ORG]] 's palace ? unfortunately , he was sleeping in a tent out in the palace yard and escaped death . however , the [[NORP]] dictator realized we were trying to kill him , so he suddenly got very cooperative . would n't it catch [[GPE]] 's attention if the [[ORG]] 's residence suddenly became a pile of rubble ? it would probably help freedom loving [[NORP]] take back their country !
now would the time to catch the [[NORP]] with their pants down . they are already shell shocked for shooting down an airliner . they will probably balk at shooting at another plane until the laser from its targeting unit hits them in the eyes .
under those stinky beards [[NORP]] leaders have a very powerful weapon : a long tongue .
to put it in perspective here ............ just imagine a [[PRODUCT]] vs [[NORP]] zero ..... see how easy that was or imagine a m1abrams tank versus a [[ORG]] !
yes . and more .
coronavirus would be a consideration , maybe . ( [[ORG]] )
take out their oil refineries , power stations . put them into the dark so they can not communicate and power their nuke plants without firing up back up systems . take out their nuke sites and anti - ship missile sites . crater runways on their airports . done .
if we want to destroy their entire country we should just install [[PRODUCT]] and his cabinet as their new government .
we have the ability to do those things , but i would tell [[GPE]] , stop or the next response is to take out a refinery . then stop , or we take your [[ORDINAL]] , then stop , or we take out your [[ORDINAL]] and last . so [[GPE]] stop , exporting terrorism and be a good neighbor ..
great and detailed analytical work , but i am ready and willing to give up my " right to know " . possibly tipping up [[GPE]] is a risky undertaking . loose lips sink ships .
why are they publishing this ? shut up !
take out the heavy weapons and arm the [[NORP]] citizens with small arms and the rest will take care of itself .

same big talk used for [[GPE]] .. [[DATE]] . low tech enemies give us problems .
just do it
[[NORP]] forces have no match to [[GPE]] , period . what hold [[ORG]] 's hands is [[GPE]] can not afford another lengthy bloody war . there is no [[GPE]] proxies having sizable grass root support in [[GPE]] to take over . [[GPE]] can not handle a large scale guerrilla warfare with periodic missiles fire toward [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] bases .
cute how [[ORG]] focuses on conventional military forces where [[GPE]] has an overwhelming advantage , while ignoring the irregular forces that are [[GPE]] 's strength .
did nâ€™t know we had this many military experts on the comment section . i feel bad for your enemies on [[ORG]] live .
they would be going over [[DATE]] if it was me .
great job mr. president !
sinc america does n't need foreign oil anymore , the main objective in [[LOC]] is to protect the democracy of [[GPE]] . that does n't bode well for [[GPE]]
[[ORDINAL]] send in the stealth bombers and by by nuclear facilities , then send in the navy and air force to lay waste to the left overs , then in go the marines to mop up the mess , then the army to keep the peace whilst we rebuild a country .
besides , now would be a great time to get some practice in with all of our new weapons and technology ...
impeachment was n't the free pass [[ORG]] convinced [[GPE]] it was .
it 's good to run through our options , but we do n't need to be bombing anyone right now . we need to pull back . we had [[CARDINAL]] combat deaths in [[PERSON]] and it was a necessary and successful war . [[PERSON]] one was severely criticized by the press and the [[NORP]] for not taking out [[PERSON]] when he had the chance , though . it turns out [[PERSON]] one was pretty wise .
a stand off war would put [[GPE]] out of it . , and no real need to put lives in harms way unless absolutely necessary . drones and cruises missiles should be able to bring a quick resolution . heck just think about turning off the lights and water alone would make [[GPE]] think twice .
in [[DATE]] i had a religious experience at [[FAC]] , [[LOC]] . i saw an [[ORG]] drop it 's full load of [[QUANTITY]] bombs on an [[ORG]] unit we were engaging . you wo n't believe the sound , smell or how the earth shook [[DATE]] . i did n't see much , i had crawled as far up inside my steel pot as i could get .
question , [[GPE]] has sub 's ? right ? can they hit our naval battle group , can they hurt [[LOC]] , etc . i do not think it would be as easy as this story says it would be . yes , we would win , but i think it would be harder than we think . i for one would like to see us knock them out in ways that will not put boots on the ground , but lets get it over width before they have a [[ORG]] .
the country of [[GPE]] is exactly how [[NORP]] want to run [[GPE]] . they all apologized to the world 's largest sponsor of terror . these crazies in our own govt need to be booted out
lol .. maybe aoc could force pelosi to draw up impeachment articles against [[GPE]] 's ruler ..... hmmm , nevermind , the articles would die before reaching the [[ORG]]
just load up a c-130 with pigs and dump em out the back .....
we have ways and means to strike [[GPE]] anytime we want . [[GPE]] knows now that the president is done warning them .
peace thru force ... it work all the time
if [[GPE]] persists to sponsor terrorism ... take out oil fields , nuclear sites , power stations and blockade their ports . refuse air access standoff and wait till they are begging to play " let 's make a deal " .
i think it 's over for now . hope so .
[[ORDINAL]] , it is a good thing , very good thing tensions are hopefully reducing . if there is another [[NORP]] attack or provocation , the response should start with weapons to blind and destroy defensive systems , anti - air missiles , radar , make follow on strikes less dangerous . next steps would be specific for how ' limited ' a response is taken , but in all scenarios use smart weapons to limit collateral damage , all attacks should be limited to legitimate military sites with a focus on minimal human casualties while maximizing impact on their ability to respond effectively and to reduce their military readiness . punish the [[ORG]] , there are multiple sites under their control that are purely military in nature and they would be a good first strike , in order to keep the response limited . the nature of the strikes would vary if the goal was to deny base function where primary attacks are against facilities and materials . at [[NORP]] naval bases , damage their most effective weapons , any subs at anchor and with tensions rising any that are deployed likely have a [[GPE]] class hunter - killer sub shadow . if the response is larger all subs would be sunk . for [[ORG]] , if the goal is to limit personnel casualties , use cluster munitions to deny ability for aircraft to take off . for the military in general , attack stockpiles of fuel and munitions . a major escalation would be to directly attack their nuclear research and production facilities .
all of the above and include the kitchen sink .
i was around during [[GPE]] . military officials said exactly the same thing . they used body count to quantify victory . we need to preserve democracy from [[NORP]] expansion , they said . generals thought through a destruction of the [[LOC]] through a bombing campaign would end the war . the [[GPE]] killed [[CARDINAL]] plus ! ! at the beginning of the bombings , [[NORP]] general [[PERSON]] said long after the [[NORP]] are gone we will still be here . as long as the [[GPE]] is unwilling to totally annihilate [[GPE]] , killing [[CARDINAL]] , they will still be there . plus ez 38 say they will [[DATE]] with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and others . [[PERSON]] will still be there . this will initiate the beginning of the end . god 's ending of human history .
threaten to make [[GPE]] listen to [[ORG]] durning their so called sessions . that is more than ample punishment for any living creature .
trump wins again . [[NORP]] were perhaps hoping he would opt to strike back . but since there were no casualties and minimal damage done during these missile strikes , [[GPE]] will now just crawl back into their turtle shells and retreat for awhile after lying to their people telling them there were casualties . they do not want to see our newest weaponry come at them .
airdrop nude pics of [[DATE]]
i 'm sorry , was [[ORG]] a cultural location , or do only [[FAC]] qualify ? bury mecca under [[QUANTITY]] of soot .
high tech toys for our high tech soldiers . don't mess with the [[GPE]] . [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
however we do it , do it good .
i read all of it , trying to see what a stealth [[PRODUCT]] was . flying so high the naked eye can not see you from the ground , is not really stealth to any other aircraft , or radar system .
send pelosi over to negotiate , they will beg for deal just to get her out of the country
[[PERSON]] would only temper her opinion if [[PRODUCT]] missiles are used in the response .
can we select " e : all the above " ?
are n't tomahawk missiles considered cultural appropriation ?
are nuclear facilities considered cultural sites ?
[[ORG]] needs to cut off all supply lines between [[GPE]] and it â€™s proxies immediately . without [[NORP]] financial and logistics supports , these proxies will die , and that will make the region and the world a much safer places .
[[GPE]] will use every weapon system at its disposal in afflicting the appropriate strike against any actions by [[GPE]] or its proxies taken against our security or national interest as well those of are allies ... peace through strength is the only thing understood by [[LOC]] enemies ...
could you imagine if they [[ORG]] have nukes ? they 'd sneak them out of the country and spread them around the region for moments just like this , or if they think their regime was coming to an end . we definitely can not let them have nukes .
no need for ground troops on this one .
what if , then what ? could , should , maybe , what then ? .... i 'm thinking on submitting a story ...
you think the [[ORG]] wants a tomahawk through his bedroom window ? of course he 's squeezing the cheese .
who cares , as long as whatever is used does the job .
if you want to win a war ith [[GPE]] , [[ORDINAL]] bomb out their refinery then take out their key electrical generators . the " war " would be over in [[DATE]] .
love all the cons on here rattling off missile types and " turn [[GPE]] into a glass parking lot " , [[ORG]] 's folds and now it 's " why the [[NORP]] so mad we ai n't going to war " . you lot are the only ones who want a war . because , like a [[DATE]] , you just love playing war . war breaks out , it 's bone spurs from top to bottom .
i surely would not broadcast what i was going to do to them .
and , make sure to slather every bomb with bacon before delivery
no need for a ground war . just use cruise missiles , and stealth aircraft to destroy their oil infrastructure , and command and control facilities and then leave . let the [[NORP]] people do the rest .
we should start sinking their subs . they 'd never know what happened . just wo n't return to port or report in
news flash to the goebbels media ! trump does n't want to or has n't even tried to attack [[GPE]] ! the warmongers on the [[NORP]] left are throwing fits [[DATE]] because [[ORG]] did n't attack !
as in the past ( like with [[GPE]] ) , we found out our old stuff worked better than their new stuff . countries in that region do n't seem to have a very good maintenance upkeep program for their planes or ships , that 's why they do n't have many ( if any ) . [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] included . so needless to say they would n't stand a chance against our newest weaponry . it 's nothing a few old precision dropped [[ORG]] 's ca nt fix .
maybe potus * can lob a few insults at 'em . he 's pretty talented in that arena
[[GPE]] is not going to push this far enough for us to really attack . they control their people by fear , they could not back down , so they run their mouth and fire a few missiles to act tough . they know [[ORG]] will be their worse nightmare if they over due it .
the [[NORP]] regime is scared out of its mind .
if we were attacking [[GPE]] it would be for only [[CARDINAL]] reason and that is to take out their nuclear capacity . our [[ORG]] and dept . defense have been working on this for [[DATE]] . do we know that they can do this ? no . can they do this ? yes . [[GPE]] wants to know , [[GPE]] wants to know , [[GPE]] wants to know because this capability adversely affects each of them . none of the devices you have mentioned are even part of the device that will be used .
use [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] 's carrying [[CARDINAL]] smart bombs for the hostages taken in [[DATE]] . the haji 's love symbolism .
love the [[GPE]] flag on the glare shield of the lead [[CARDINAL]]
all of the above if the time comes . right now , everyone is in standdown mode over the current crisis .
it seems to me , these tomahawk missiles would be an easy take - out by the s-300 's etc . where am i wrong ? also , it also seems to be , we would be taking some losses , especially at the initial state , especially the air force . also , i noticed [[DATE]] that [[GPE]] made its statement which said , if this does not deescalate , it would lead to nuclear war . that of course is a dead giveaway that [[GPE]] would indeed , guaranteed come to [[GPE]] 's rescue now matter what we say or think and they would use nukes . as far as i 'm concerned , [[GPE]] is a far worse terror than [[GPE]] will ever be .
the [[GPE]] knew where that other bum was and took him out . i for one hope we have a constant tail on the ayatollah and drop some lead on that guy asap .
given this , [[CARDINAL]] much - discussed phrase to keep in mind is ... " no war plan survives [[ORDINAL]] contact with the enemy . " or , as [[PERSON]] put it , " everyone has a plan , until they get punched in the face . "
[[NORP]] are upset that president [[PERSON]] did n't order an all out nuclear strike on [[GPE]] .
what did you do when finally a [[GPE]] president stood up for his people . i ran
strongest economy , best president and most powerful military in the world . it 's good to be an [[NORP]] .
trouble is , we already have been invaded by [[CARDINAL]] of [[GPE]] 's primary proxy groups , the [[NORP]] party . we need to eliminate that threat [[ORDINAL]] .
wow , a whole article devoted to information everyone already knows .
there just wo n't be another boots on the ground war in [[LOC]] . we have she 'd too much blood over these tribes . it 's time to start destroying economies
only under the most extreme circumstances would we use soldiers on the ground in some kind of invasion force . i do n't even know what those circumstances would be . if we attack [[GPE]] it will be taking out what ever [[ORG]] they even have . and with cruise missiles hitting known military sites . and electromagnetic attacks destroying their communication command and control . should [[GPE]] try to fly fighter planes , they will just make a few new aces of [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] pilots . as for submarines , they wo n't get out of port before getting torpedos up their rear . that 's how we will fight [[GPE]] . not with some kind of d day invasion . we wo n't need to do much more . they 'll get the message . or maybe even better the [[NORP]] people will get the message and finally revolt against the oppressive regime and take back what the [[PERSON]] took from them in [[DATE]] .
basically , we can wipe them off the face of the [[LOC]] without so much as a hiccup but , their administration is too stupid to know it . i feel bad for the good people of [[GPE]] because there are lots of them .
most all of it . whatever it takes . ;-) you do n't handicap yourself in a fight . [[ORG]]
i was hoping there was options to what we would expect . what excuse would we need to take out the nuclear sites in [[GPE]] ? well we had it [[DATE]] . i believe and expect [[ORG]] to make sure [[GPE]] will not get a nuclear weapon built . [[DATE]] i 'm gon na watch the [[LOC]] , [[NORP]] fall all over themselves with [[ORG]] attacks .
trump is a problem solver . [[GPE]] is the biggest problem in [[LOC]] . do the math and bottom line is [[GPE]] loses big time .
funny they did nt mention [[PERSON]] or [[GPE]] . quick , easy and more importantly final
correct answer : all of the above .
the mullahs did n't want to end up in a smoking [[PERSON]] heap like their head terrorist
obama dropped cash from the sky ..... ... we could try that . it might be cheaper .
[[CARDINAL]] of the [[ORDINAL]] things to go will be [[GPE]] 's refineries . that will cripple their economy and limit their ability to wage war . no fuel makes many of their assets worthless .
use cruise missiles to make the a glowing cross , across [[GPE]] and have a satellite photo taken . would completely drive them insane
this just in . news bulletin : [[GPE]] has been placed on a suicide watch . our military is keeping a close eye on the [[ORG]] to make sure they do n't do anything to potentially harm or destroy themselves .
do not underestimate radicals ... that includes the [[NORP]] .
drop [[PERSON]] from a [[PRODUCT]] . more devastating than a moab !
you know what you call a truly " woke " [[NORP]] ? [[NORP]] ...
it â€™s over . next article .
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " all of the above plus more that civilians do nt even know about .
it would be in [[GPE]] 's best interests if another nation did the next strike . [[GPE]] lost a lot of folk on flight [[DATE]] , which will prove to be accidental [[NORP]] aa activity caused by their hostile behavior for [[DATE]] .
for those of you that like to keep up with our military might and deterrence . as i write this post to you we are building the successes to [[LAW]] . many of my old colleagues are supplying the advanced high tech electronics in building this star wars like boomer . no foe of ours will ever equal our technology to build such a peace keeper . that no foes in the world .
hilarious article . it is like a defense industry lobbyist 's [[DATE]] list .
it really does break my heart to see so many people and the media taking the side of absolute terrorists simply because they hate [[ORG]] . sure they try to disguise it by using terms like " assassination " and " religious scholars " . no one hates the [[NORP]] people . we know they are forced to live under this religious fanatical govt . the harsh reality is that government truly wishes death upon all [[NORP]] , and yes even those who naively think apologizing for [[NORP]] will protect them . no , they want you dead too .
what are the odds it was one of these [[ORG]] that shot down the [[NORP]] plane ?
a war with [[GPE]] will destroy the [[NORP]] regime and the [[NORP]] military . all the [[ORG]] need do is look at [[GPE]] and think how different president [[PERSON]] is to [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] regarding his generals and war fighting .
if we have anything to fear from [[GPE]] then [[GPE]] is in real trouble , if [[ORG]] tells the military to neutralize [[GPE]] and use all means necessary they could do the job in [[DATE]] , end of story , end of [[GPE]] as a prick in our sides . [[ORG]]
[[GPE]] would n't last long . they fought [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] with both of them having elite forces as they said , and neither side won . meanwhile the [[GPE]] tears through [[NORP]] forces like a wet paper bag ....... so does anyone really think [[GPE]] would fare better than [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] do n't think so . ðŸ˜Ž
before everyone gets excited , remember . [[GPE]] has the best stand off weapons . missiles that can hit a [[CARDINAL]] ft . target from [[QUANTITY]] away . we do n't even have to work up a sweat and can be very selective on targets .
trump is not a nation building [[GPE]] guy . if [[GPE]] gets destroyed , it 's their problem
you folks have no clue of what the [[GPE]] capability 's have in stored for any of our foes . wrap your head around this [[NORP]] citizens . just [[CARDINAL]] boomer sub that have the tried and true [[PRODUCT]] nuke missiles . each have the capability those missiles can carry up to 3 to [[CARDINAL]] independent murv's. take that times [[CARDINAL]] missile bays on the boat . it can take out an entire continent within [[TIME]] . fact
they forgot to list [[ORG]] , and drones
trump 2020 ! !
the [[GPE]] will release a bus load of liberal socialist climate change protesters in [[GPE]] . that will send the [[NORP]] regime into hiding lickety split .
ya sure lets spend all the money on rebuilding [[GPE]] . as if the money spent in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] was not enough .
everyone here knows that [[GPE]] is the one who asked us to take out that general anyway , right ?
i say we employ the most dangerous weapon we have - [[GPE]] . send all the virtue - signaling celebrities over there to lecture [[GPE]] about wokeness . within [[DATE]] [[GPE]] will call trump and say " ok you 've made your point ; no nukes , [[GPE]] can exist , whatever you want . but you have to take them back ! "
trash talking little [[NORP]] bully does n't want more of this . that 's why that shot at nothing .
[[GPE]] appears to have gotten lucky . if any of our military would have been killed , [[GPE]] would have lost its [[ORG]] , air [[ORG]] , army , air defenses , oil production , and electricity
icbm 's tipped with thermonuclear warheads . for a start .
let them sweat .. unless they harm another [[NORP]] .
" nonetheless , it is by no means clear , despite [[NORP]] claims , that these advanced air defenses can actually threaten the most advanced [[GPE]] stealth attack assets . " however ' tipping our hand ' to the [[NORP]] who are most certainly present in [[GPE]] as ' advisers ' revealing just what we can , and can not do gives them some pretty valuable intelligence on our capabilities , does n't it ? is this worth it ?
" submarine or ship - launched [[PRODUCT]] missiles " since a submarine is technically a ship ( though not a surface vessel ) is n't is redundant saying " submarine or ship - launched " ?
the most dangerous lethal weapon to unleash on [[GPE]] . box up [[ORG]] and fake american followers in our country , and ship them to iran . that will do it ! lol ! lol ! lol !
i wonder what the world 's largest defense budget can buy you ? [[ORG]] : it is the largest and most capable navy in the world and it has been estimated that in terms of tonnage of its active battle fleet alone , it is larger than the next 13 navies combined , which includes [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] allies or partner nations . it has [[CARDINAL]] deployable combat vessels and [[CARDINAL]] operational aircraft as of [[DATE]] , making it the [[ORDINAL]] - largest air force in the world , after [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] .
" how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " --yes
the problem with any war is that as soon as a country uses its best secret weapons they 're no longer secret ... from anybody .
all of the above !
just start ' chuting in herds of hogs ; the squealing alone would have the [[NORP]] dropping guns and running for cover .
[[GPE]] could pulverize the entire country of [[GPE]] in a [[DATE]] or [[CARDINAL]] . that is why they do not want a war .
drop aoc and squad into [[GPE]] , or would that be against [[FAC]] and a war crime ?
the measured response by president [[PERSON]] shows that he is not trying to start a war . but i guarantee you , [[GPE]] is not going to listen . they have had many chances to come to the table . they want war . that 's all they know .
trump launched a few strikes that killed [[CARDINAL]] high level terrorist generals , a few mid level terrorist commanders and [[CARDINAL]] terrorist troops . [[GPE]] " retaliated " and [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] were trampled in a funeral parade and a civilian airliner crashed killing [[CARDINAL]] people . trump just needs to step back and let [[GPE]] destroy itself like the [[DATE]] [[NORP]] candidates are doing .
how ? tomahawk missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc ...
when i was active during the [[ORDINAL]] [[EVENT]] , i remember the media tried to tell everyone how dangerous [[GPE]] 's military was . how their soldiers were battle hardened and would fight tenaciously fight to the death with religious fanaticism . they said the war " would [[DATE]] " . what they seemed to lack was a basic understanding that [[GPE]] , as well as [[NORP]] soldiers only fight because to not was certain death . they know they are on the side of wrong and evil . once the bombs started falling and their leaders scrambled , they begged us to take them hostage . they are poorly led , unpaid , underfed and unmotivated . they have viertually [[CARDINAL]] capability to strike at distance with any accuracy . how did that " [[WORK_OF_ART]] war " work out ? days , that s how . their soldiers were being decimated by ghosts and that s even worse than hand to hand combat . go ahead [[GPE]] . it will be much the same for you .....
i 'm sure we still have some moabs laying around - we only used one in [[GPE]] and it made quite an impact ( both literal and metaphorical ) . [[PERSON]] a couple as close as possible to [[GPE]] without killing civilians .
another low - cost highly effective weapon - release more goats during funeral processions . they ca n't help themselves .
[[ORG]] on [[GPE]] . solve multiple problems at once .
just as you would nâ€™t call the woods before hunting and tell the animals what weapons and grain of bullets you plan on using there â€™s no way this is a definitive list of weaponry !
if done right , i would hope we could have [[GPE]] pretty well closed out within [[DATE]] or 2 , followed by mop up and hopefully proper occupational missions .
the [[GPE]] has enough tech , that not [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] would need to step foot in [[GPE]] .
we should attack with bacon bombs
since the [[GPE]] just blinked , i wonder how long it will take for [[GPE]] to act up again . i 'm predicting not long at all ! !
why even post this article ? the president made it clear that [[GPE]] is standing down and so is the [[ORG]] trying to drum up drama where there is none . you 're like a bunch of highschoolers spreading rumors .
they will use all of the above if necessary .. the days of placating those crazies are over .
can you say lopsided .... [[GPE]] destroyed in [[TIME]] .
i hope [[GPE]] continues to stand down but i doubt it ...... [[GPE]] received their final warning [[DATE]] .
it would be nothing short of downright absurd to put troops on the ground and risk more [[NORP]] lives when we can surgically dismantle the entire nation of [[GPE]] via aerial assault .
how about the fact [[GPE]] is watching the show ..
[[PRODUCT]] missiles to take out all sams and crater the military runways . then follow up with b2 's to take out their [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , and oil refineries .
[[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] 's that just flew by [[GPE]] might have something to do with it . thud .
[[GPE]] are simple and put no friendly forces at risk . just a suggestion ...
i think we could use a curtiss - wright jenny and a box of hand grenades and they would surrender .
... or all the above !
we 're using [[PERSON]] 's boring machine to dig a tunnel under their uranium refining facilities .
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? i prefer " all of the above "
if we were to wage war with [[GPE]] , we would need to fight until an unconditioned surrender , ala [[GPE]] . that would require we reconstruct their society much as [[PERSON]] did on [[GPE]] . it did work in [[GPE]] but it is not an easy task . what we do n't want is another [[GPE]] . we do not want to wipe out their government and destabilize their military and then leave . that is a recipe for ww3
a nuclear [[ORG]] over [[GPE]] would demonstrate nicely how vulnerable they are .
how about raw bacon bombs , [[QUANTITY]] drums of bacon grease .
q - how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? a - it wo n't .
why waste time speculating on what the [[GPE]] could do ? there are many options , but listing them is a non story .
president [[PERSON]] channels president [[PERSON]] 's foreign policy : " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
anyway we dam well please !
give [[GPE]] the green light .
the simple threat of these means is all it will take . no attack needed
i 'm going with [[ORG]] since he just moved a large fleet of them [[TIME]] into the region .
this obsession with destryoing others using violence , will [[CARDINAL]] day destroy the self
the ' [[WORK_OF_ART]] bomb , last used on [[LOC]] , dropped on [[GPE]] .
the best deterrent [[GPE]] has in responding to [[NORP]] terrorism is the willingness to use the weapons we have , with impunity , until it becomes obvious that [[ORG]] meant what he said .
enlist the [[NORP]] to help ... oh wait , [[PERSON]] abandoned them .
sea , air , land ?
how about you just shut up , good thing these folks were not around during [[EVENT]] .
all of the above ?
how about this ... you so - called journalist report the news after the fact and forgo the speculation on what we " might " do . there are planners in [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] responsible for military action and reaction . they will let you and the enemy know what they are going to do at the appropriate time .
the [[ORDINAL]] thing we should do to contain [[GPE]] is to get rid of their allies in the [[ORG]] .
i think it might look great from our view and terrible from [[GPE]] 's view .
why do n't you just figure out for them what we are going to do ? [[PERSON]] , did you mail this piece to [[GPE]] ? are you trying to look smart ?
is n't this a desirable time to test drive [[CARDINAL]] of our hyper - sonic blasts - from - the - past toys ? creating a large blackened stain on the ground would be a nice deterrent for all ... and even cause [[GPE]] to back off [[DATE]] to re - enter catch - up mode ...
we can inflict the most pain and suffering on the [[NORP]] people by letting them live with their current government .
une-2011 : president [[PERSON]] has authorized [[CARDINAL]] drone strikes in [[GPE]] since he took office in [[DATE]] - columbian journalism review ( and others ) .
the [[PERSON]] is so mad he wants his untraceable cash back from the [[NORP]] .
is it me , or does anyone else see a need to limit our options in a public forum seems like a bad idea ? let â€™s surprise them , everybody loves a surprise !
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? yes , and [[GPE]] knows it .
if the [[GPE]] attacks [[GPE]] directly , it will destroy all communications and radar in [[TIME]] , just like in the war with [[GPE]] . after that , it will be easy .
[[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] would take care of them .
why would we in our right mind send in ground troops ? ? we could destroy the country from the air ! !
is it just me or would it be a good idea to keep all this secret ! ! ! ! ! !
i hear the rail gun needs more testing ... same goes for the hyper - sonic cruise missile .
[[GPE]] is like a big dumb football jock who brags about the size of their private parts .
the [[PERSON]] know that precise [[NORP]] attacks would degrade their military past the point of being able to defend the country and leave them vulnerable to internal revolution . they 're going to continue to bark like a small scared dog , do nothing and hope to survive .
" how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " yes to all of the above .
i could see the generals planning a strike awaiting the presidents go ahead . drone take out air defense , followed by tomahawks for the air bases , bombers to flatten military bases , and finish off out of reach nuclear facilities with stealth jets before he can finish his ice cream .
we would not send aircraft over [[GPE]] as they field a very strong sam network . our aircraft would be chewed up . i would expect both sea and air launched cruise missiles , ( totaling [[CARDINAL]] ) targeting power and communication systems .
[[CARDINAL]] tac nuke right into [[NORP]] lap
