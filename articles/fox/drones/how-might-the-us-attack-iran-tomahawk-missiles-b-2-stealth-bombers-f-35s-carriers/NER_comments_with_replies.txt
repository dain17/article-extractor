if you had seen what i seen in [[GPE]] , and a lot of men will back me up on this , you would said get the popcorn and beer this is going to be fun .
we can soften them up with airpower but a full scale invasion would be an absolute disaster for the [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] is twice the size of [[GPE]] and while [[GPE]] is flat , [[GPE]] is mountainous . it 's a paradise for guerrilla warfare .
true .... if we want to win , operations olympic and coronet wo n't do the job . [[PERSON]] have to name some [[PRODUCT]] 's " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " and " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " .
it may make for interesting reading but i think unless [[GPE]] attacks targets in the [[GPE]] , we are not going to be sending ground troops into [[GPE]] . we do n't need another [[GPE]] . if we need to destroy them , we can do it by air . and do n't get into an " nation building " this time .
agree , but i do not think it would ever come to ground troops as we are not their neighbor and who would they attack in our stead ?
i agree , i do n’t think [[ORG]] wants anything to do with another war
he 's let the [[NORP]] run wild for [[DATE]] ......
" let me count the ways . for the ends of being and ideal [[ORG]] . most quiet need , by sun and candle - light "
hey ... i know a couple of guys who could easily take care of this whole situation ... street names are " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " and [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . no worries ...
spin the wheel of armament choices and let 'em rip ! pres t 2020 ! ! ! !
a high rating game show !
how might we attack ? let me count the ways .................
i love it when the military has a venue to be a proving ground for its weapons . [[GPE]] is a great place to test our weapons against the enemy .
just do it
hey fox , quit running war sims for [[GPE]] . let them figure it out on their own reconnaissance ..
bomb their land with pig carcasses ...
hit their oil delvery systems along the coast hard . they need the money . gets em right in the bread basket . few collateral casualties . they can use obamas gift money to rebuild . then hit it again . no money for nukes .
same big talk used for [[GPE]] .. [[DATE]] . low tech enemies give us problems .
does n't anyone recall president [[PERSON]] 's attack on [[ORG]] 's palace ? unfortunately , he was sleeping in a tent out in the palace yard and escaped death . however , the [[NORP]] dictator realized we were trying to kill him , so he suddenly got very cooperative . would n't it catch [[GPE]] 's attention if the [[ORG]] 's residence suddenly became a pile of rubble ? it would probably help freedom loving [[NORP]] take back their country !
now would the time to catch the [[NORP]] with their pants down . they are already shell shocked for shooting down an airliner . they will probably balk at shooting at another plane until the laser from its targeting unit hits them in the eyes .
under those stinky beards [[NORP]] leaders have a very powerful weapon : a long tongue .
[[GPE]] , is this a personal experience comment ?
to put it in perspective here ............ just imagine a [[PRODUCT]] vs [[NORP]] zero ..... see how easy that was or imagine a m1abrams tank versus a [[ORG]] !
yes . and more .
coronavirus would be a consideration , maybe . ( [[ORG]] )
take out their oil refineries , power stations . put them into the dark so they can not communicate and power their nuke plants without firing up back up systems . take out their nuke sites and anti - ship missile sites . crater runways on their airports . done .
if we want to destroy their entire country we should just install [[PRODUCT]] and his cabinet as their new government .
in [[TIME]] , [[PERSON]] will endeavor to impeach him . in [[DATE]] , [[GPE]] will have [[DATE]] best economy on the planet .
[[ORG]] why you would say something stupid like that , unless you are a [[NORP]] troll . everybody in america knows ( although many still will not admit it ) that [[ORG]] has had the opposite effect on our country . we currently have the greatest economy and greatest military ever !
we have the ability to do those things , but i would tell [[GPE]] , stop or the next response is to take out a refinery . then stop , or we take your [[ORDINAL]] , then stop , or we take out your [[ORDINAL]] and last . so [[GPE]] stop , exporting terrorism and be a good neighbor ..
great and detailed analytical work , but i am ready and willing to give up my " right to know " . possibly tipping up [[GPE]] is a risky undertaking . loose lips sink ships .
i assume you 're talking about [[NORP]] ?
why are they publishing this ? shut up !
take out the heavy weapons and arm the [[NORP]] citizens with small arms and the rest will take care of itself .

just do it
[[NORP]] forces have no match to [[GPE]] , period . what hold [[ORG]] 's hands is [[GPE]] can not afford another lengthy bloody war . there is no [[GPE]] proxies having sizable grass root support in [[GPE]] to take over . [[GPE]] can not handle a large scale guerrilla warfare with periodic missiles fire toward [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] bases .
cute how [[ORG]] focuses on conventional military forces where [[GPE]] has an overwhelming advantage , while ignoring the irregular forces that are [[GPE]] 's strength .
you do know where [[GPE]] is , do n't you ? if they go after [[GPE]] , they are very capable to defend themselves and have [[ORG]] as a last resort . also , air power is not conventional and that is all we need ..
irregular forces ? you mean goat herders with [[ORG]] 's ? no worries , we have [[NORP]] .
yes the terrorists and other irregular forces could be used for terror and bloodshed , but would not impact a major military campaign . many will bring up the example of the [[ORG]] ... they were never more than a nuisance and useful for scaring the [[NORP]] populace than effective military action . the [[ORG]] fought the major battles with a near equipment equality that [[GPE]] does not have .
that is what they said about [[GPE]] . we will never put boots on the ground in [[GPE]] , we will just degrade their military and nuke sites
please share why the us military should fear [[NORP]] irregular forces .
irregular forces , aka rabble
[[ORG]] .
did n’t know we had this many military experts on the comment section . i feel bad for your enemies on [[ORG]] live .
i hear the best part is being able to restart the game when you die .
they would be going over [[DATE]] if it was me .
go sign up then
great job mr. president !
sinc america does n't need foreign oil anymore , the main objective in [[LOC]] is to protect the democracy of [[GPE]] . that does n't bode well for [[GPE]]
i was surprised to hear that [[PERSON]] tried to distance himself from this .
it was a very wise decision for [[GPE]] to stay quiet , otherwise the [[NORP]] would use his aggression to fuel more hate for the [[NORP]] leading to more attacks on them . he in fact by staying quiet , denied them of any fuel to that fire !
it would be a political win for netanyahu if he would have stuck with [[ORG]]
why ? he did n't do it .
i was n't , he needs to stay out of our way . period .
i was too
[[ORDINAL]] send in the stealth bombers and by by nuclear facilities , then send in the navy and air force to lay waste to the left overs , then in go the marines to mop up the mess , then the army to keep the peace whilst we rebuild a country .
update . the coronavirus from [[GPE]] will now do are dirty work for us .
never , never rebuild a country . work towards strong relations with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and all of [[LOC]] .
no need for boots on the ground . and their will not be .
with [[CARDINAL]] of [[GPE]] casualties and [[DATE]] of occupation and no sign of peace , once we tired of the bloodshed and left , the regime would rebuild , more committed than ever to [[WORK_OF_ART]] . saw to many nightly news broadcasts showing [[GPE]] dead from [[GPE]] . know too many military widows and orphans from more recent military actions . avoid boots on the ground . if a military response is needed , have it be measured and as surgical and precise as possible to enable all to step back and be able to shut down attacks and get back to negotiations . tighten economic embargoes , cut off more of their hard currency income , use diplomatic pressure . increase counter - propaganda to instill unrest in their populace . always have the door open to talks and be willing to serious negotiations . a real war would have consequences that no one could fully comprehend and it is not worth large scale death and destruction in either their country or ours .
bring them to the table of [[ORDINAL]] and [[ORDINAL]] simultaniously(sic ) . moab the nuclear facilities and destroy the refineries . no fuel will bring down the house of cards !
the general died , surgical strike if you will , was spot on . if you actually read your comments we have under several presidents including the current president have tried multiple attempts at peace including sanctions , giving [[CARDINAL]] of money , etc . we are dealing with a terrorist style regime in [[GPE]] . there is no need for boots on the ground , we have the best tech and have demonstrated how to use it .
no need for boots in [[GPE]] . their own people are dying for freedom
besides , now would be a great time to get some practice in with all of our new weapons and technology ...
impeachment was n't the free pass [[ORG]] convinced [[GPE]] it was .
it 's good to run through our options , but we do n't need to be bombing anyone right now . we need to pull back . we had [[CARDINAL]] combat deaths in [[PERSON]] and it was a necessary and successful war . [[PERSON]] one was severely criticized by the press and the [[NORP]] for not taking out [[PERSON]] when he had the chance , though . it turns out [[PERSON]] one was pretty wise .
i say let president [[PERSON]] do his job . he will do what is right when the time is right and that is that . i have not ever [[ORDINAL]] guessed a president in situations like this and i was there in theater at the beginning of [[PERSON]] .
exactly . the president is following the lead of the [[ORG]] in war possibilities
in [[DATE]] in reply to a [[NORP]] complaint that we did not go to [[GPE]] , i said " we would become an army of occupation and they would learn to hate us . " in that part of the world removing dictators and allowing religious zealots to take power has harmed peace , the unintended consequence .
and your expertise and sources of information on the subject is what , exactly , compared to the information resources , strategy sources and understanding of our tactical response of the president of [[GPE]] ? you ’re either just another armchair keyboard warrior or your an on duty national security official operating outside of the chain of command and violating the law by undermining the role of the [[ORG]] .
i am just giving my opinion and citing history .
disagree with the pull back assertion . we need to stay leaning forward but not necessary bombing anyone . pulling back is a sign of weakness in [[LOC]] that will get you killed .
easing up on the throttle ... isn't pulling back .. we are in fact still in a standoff ! but we are now in a position that can deescalate into a more happy ending for everyone .
a stand off war would put [[GPE]] out of it . , and no real need to put lives in harms way unless absolutely necessary . drones and cruises missiles should be able to bring a quick resolution . heck just think about turning off the lights and water alone would make [[GPE]] think twice .
somebody has to fly the moabs to the nuclear facilities .
in [[DATE]] i had a religious experience at [[FAC]] , [[LOC]] . i saw an [[ORG]] drop it 's full load of [[QUANTITY]] bombs on an [[ORG]] unit we were engaging . you wo n't believe the sound , smell or how the earth shook [[DATE]] . i did n't see much , i had crawled as far up inside my steel pot as i could get .
my dad and uncles served there too . you guys were very underappreciated
er , why were you busy engaging with the [[NORP]] allies ? was it a friendly fire incident ? during [[PERSON]] ; [[ORG]] troops ?
my bad , [[ORG]] . thanks for the heads up . i do n't see , hear or think or anything else as good as i used to . it was nva , not friendlies . i was attached to [[ORG]] and working with an [[ORG]] unit out of the [[ORG]] camp .
you 're not alone with that , [[ORG]] . keep your spirits up . thank you for your service , brother .
i was born in [[DATE]] . from [[CARDINAL]] veteran to another , thank you for your service .
question , [[GPE]] has sub 's ? right ? can they hit our naval battle group , can they hurt [[LOC]] , etc . i do not think it would be as easy as this story says it would be . yes , we would win , but i think it would be harder than we think . i for one would like to see us knock them out in ways that will not put boots on the ground , but lets get it over width before they have a [[ORG]] .
yes they have a few diesel boats , [[CARDINAL]] , [[PERSON]] class [[NORP]] boats from the [[DATE]] 's and [[CARDINAL]] 's ; a few small locally made copies and midget subs . none are ballistic missile boats , a few can launch cruise missiles . when the tensions ratcheted , expect there to be a [[GPE]] class hunter - killer or [[CARDINAL]] in the are , lurking and trailing their boats . while quiet all subs are subject to detection by patrol aircraft and satellites . the biggest fear is their response . they are active sponsors of terrorists in many nations and if in a corner could lash out at civilian targets in nearby countries including [[GPE]] . they likely have sleeper cells of terrorists here with attack plans to cause maximum carnage . if all we wanted to do was take them out as a military threat , it would be easy with [[ORG]] , ship and sub launched cruise missiles . and if we really cared , a couple of moabs after the air defenses were softened . [[ORG]] is needed . let the tension reduce . get them to the table , renegotiate a new deal that does n't just push the nuclear program down the road , but ends their work towards obtaining one .
it 's only hard because we are civilized and do n't want to kill innocent civilians . imagine if we were as evil as the people in charge over there . it 'd be over in [[TIME]] .
absolutely !
you 'd be awfully surprised how easy it would be to bring [[GPE]] to its knees . case in point .... not long ago [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] war planes invaded [[NORP]] airspace . a flight of our newest stealth fighters intercepted them . the [[NORP]] pilots were not aware of their presence . [[CARDINAL]] of the [[GPE]] pilots went under them to inspect their weapons loads then rolled out from under them onto their left , then sent a radio message as follows " go home " . they left . keep in mind that since [[PERSON]] sanctions , [[GPE]] does n't have the parts to maintain its small airforce . most of them are grounded as a result . missile wise their missiles are more advanced than the rest of their military , but not much of a threat to our new fighters and bombers . [[NORP]] subs are diesel class subs . [[ORG]] , just as easily tracked and destroyed as their planes . [[GPE]] 's navy is equally ineffective since their technology is [[DATE]] behind the times . we have , well goodness , stealth bombers , fighters , missiles , submarines and aircraft carriers , cruisers , destroyers . our navy alone would utterly destroy the [[NORP]] navy and ports not to mention their missile launch capabilitys . our airforce ...... well need i go on ? if [[ORG]] allowed the military to be as decisive as they were in [[GPE]] and then in [[NORP]] , things would n't last long for [[GPE]] .
so a few paralyzing hits might calm them , but then its wellcome to the quagmire , mr [[PERSON]] !
let me get this straight , you 're clueless ?
just as easily tracked and destroyed as their planes . the disgusting thing is that [[LOC]] where the subs would operate is < [[CARDINAL]] ft avg .... a dc6 awacs with a radioshack radar downlooking can spot them ! and no rocks to hide .... plus the electric network supplying [[PERCENT]] of irans agglomeration is bult by [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] , on [[CARDINAL]] 's specs : huge transformers in remote areas [[ORG]] by a well documented series of antiquated abb power plants made in [[GPE]] . their locations are published in [[GPE]] . i do nt think there would be enough transformer oil available to replenish them .
the country of [[GPE]] is exactly how [[NORP]] want to run [[GPE]] . they all apologized to the world 's largest sponsor of terror . these crazies in our own govt need to be booted out
lol .. maybe aoc could force pelosi to draw up impeachment articles against [[GPE]] 's ruler ..... hmmm , nevermind , the articles would die before reaching the [[ORG]]
just load up a c-130 with pigs and dump em out the back .....
we have ways and means to strike [[GPE]] anytime we want . [[GPE]] knows now that the president is done warning them .
peace thru force ... it work all the time
if [[GPE]] persists to sponsor terrorism ... take out oil fields , nuclear sites , power stations and blockade their ports . refuse air access standoff and wait till they are begging to play " let 's make a deal " .
i think it 's over for now . hope so .
[[ORDINAL]] , it is a good thing , very good thing tensions are hopefully reducing . if there is another [[NORP]] attack or provocation , the response should start with weapons to blind and destroy defensive systems , anti - air missiles , radar , make follow on strikes less dangerous . next steps would be specific for how ' limited ' a response is taken , but in all scenarios use smart weapons to limit collateral damage , all attacks should be limited to legitimate military sites with a focus on minimal human casualties while maximizing impact on their ability to respond effectively and to reduce their military readiness . punish the [[ORG]] , there are multiple sites under their control that are purely military in nature and they would be a good first strike , in order to keep the response limited . the nature of the strikes would vary if the goal was to deny base function where primary attacks are against facilities and materials . at [[NORP]] naval bases , damage their most effective weapons , any subs at anchor and with tensions rising any that are deployed likely have a [[GPE]] class hunter - killer sub shadow . if the response is larger all subs would be sunk . for [[ORG]] , if the goal is to limit personnel casualties , use cluster munitions to deny ability for aircraft to take off . for the military in general , attack stockpiles of fuel and munitions . a major escalation would be to directly attack their nuclear research and production facilities .
the [[ORG]] , there are multiple sites under their control that are purely military in nature and they would be a good first strike , the electric grid is distributed outside cities . but again : their latrins and [[PERSON]] is purely military . what tyou mean we wo nt have strategic bombing of large civilian agglomerations like what bomber harris did and we did in [[GPE]] . that seems to be ineffective militarily speaking .
taking out the power grid is a legitimate target as it would cause unrest , restrict their ability to respond effectively and are usually remote isolated targets . included in the power grid would be dams , take out any that the flooding would not likely cause civilian casualties . since large scale travel during a conflict would be almost exclusive to their military , bridges that primarily serve military installations would be a good soft target . easy to hit remotely with cruise missiles .
limited to legitimate military sites blah the soup kitchen is a military site , the public sewers are .
all of the above and include the kitchen sink .
i was around during [[GPE]] . military officials said exactly the same thing . they used body count to quantify victory . we need to preserve democracy from [[NORP]] expansion , they said . generals thought through a destruction of the [[LOC]] through a bombing campaign would end the war . the [[GPE]] killed [[CARDINAL]] plus ! ! at the beginning of the bombings , [[NORP]] general [[PERSON]] said long after the [[NORP]] are gone we will still be here . as long as the [[GPE]] is unwilling to totally annihilate [[GPE]] , killing [[CARDINAL]] , they will still be there . plus ez 38 say they will [[DATE]] with [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and others . [[PERSON]] will still be there . this will initiate the beginning of the end . god 's ending of human history .
they used to think they could flower in democracy and fair governments would rise with a little help .. that is no longer an agenda and in fact a failed concept . [[GPE]] is out of [[FAC]] wars . we do n't want to make their government for them anymore ... only make their government comply with the rest of the world ! no more terrorism and no more hostile expansionism !
[[ORG]] !
threaten to make [[GPE]] listen to [[ORG]] durning their so called sessions . that is more than ample punishment for any living creature .
trump wins again . [[NORP]] were perhaps hoping he would opt to strike back . but since there were no casualties and minimal damage done during these missile strikes , [[GPE]] will now just crawl back into their turtle shells and retreat for awhile after lying to their people telling them there were casualties . they do not want to see our newest weaponry come at them .
airdrop nude pics of [[DATE]]
i 'm sorry , was [[ORG]] a cultural location , or do only [[FAC]] qualify ? bury mecca under [[QUANTITY]] of soot .
i know what you mean , but [[GPE]] is n't in [[GPE]] .
who cares ?
high tech toys for our high tech soldiers . don't mess with the [[GPE]] . [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
however we do it , do it good .
i read all of it , trying to see what a stealth [[PRODUCT]] was . flying so high the naked eye can not see you from the ground , is not really stealth to any other aircraft , or radar system .
reread the piece . the [[PRODUCT]] , [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] are stealthy , as are the newer drones . you go in and take out defensive detection an related firepower [[ORDINAL]] and then use conventional aircraft to take out other targets . b-52s are not stealthy , which i presume that they were n’t referenced as such in the piece . neither or [[PRODUCT]] though their rcs is still significantly smaller than the [[PRODUCT]] . as the current f-18e / f aircraft were an rcs improvement over the smaller [[PRODUCT]] versions .
obviously [[GPE]] 's air defenses would be the [[ORDINAL]] to go . [[ORDINAL]] would be their outdated air force
the headline is flawed . there is no such thing as a stealth [[PRODUCT]] .
true . only the b2
send pelosi over to negotiate , they will beg for deal just to get her out of the country
pelosi would go into withdrawals from alcohol if she went into a dry country . she ca n't take that chance .
indeed , a fact that escaped me
she would n't go , there 's no alcohol allowed .
[[PERSON]] would only temper her opinion if [[PRODUCT]] missiles are used in the response .
she has hypersonic lips , she intends to use them against [[LOC]] enemies !
can we select " e : all the above " ?
no ground war , please . it is not necessary to accomplish what we need .
this news story does n't mention a ground war . so it would n't be included in " all the above "
are n't tomahawk missiles considered cultural appropriation ?
no , it 's a salute to their heritage .
lost is one of my favorite series , if that 's the [[PERSON]] your referring to . there was also a writer by that name , but i 'm not that crazy about him ...
are nuclear facilities considered cultural sites ?
[[NORP]] are known to hide things in [[LOC]] ... because they are off the table as a target . but i seriously doubt they can hide a nuclear facility in [[CARDINAL]] .. lol but you never know , [[PERSON]] might can have a tent that is a huge mansion ! lmao
[[ORG]] needs to cut off all supply lines between [[GPE]] and it ’s proxies immediately . without [[NORP]] financial and logistics supports , these proxies will die , and that will make the region and the world a much safer places .
[[GPE]] will use every weapon system at its disposal in afflicting the appropriate strike against any actions by [[GPE]] or its proxies taken against our security or national interest as well those of are allies ... peace through strength is the only thing understood by [[LOC]] enemies ...
sure pal . let 's hope they do better than they did in [[GPE]] . we had weapons we could have but did not use . we had tactics that were better but did not use . the [[ORG]] makes all the difference .
politicians made the choices in [[GPE]] . the choices in any war should be made that accept nothing but absolute victory .
you know what we have now they did n't in [[GPE]] ? ? ? president [[PERSON]] .... lol
could you imagine if they [[ORG]] have nukes ? they 'd sneak them out of the country and spread them around the region for moments just like this , or if they think their regime was coming to an end . we definitely can not let them have nukes .
no need for ground troops on this one .
what if , then what ? could , should , maybe , what then ? .... i 'm thinking on submitting a story ...
you think the [[ORG]] wants a tomahawk through his bedroom window ? of course he 's squeezing the cheese .
who cares , as long as whatever is used does the job .
right . everybody in , everybody out , nobody gets hurt . make it happen people , who needs details .
if you want to win a war ith [[GPE]] , [[ORDINAL]] bomb out their refinery then take out their key electrical generators . the " war " would be over in [[DATE]] .
why are you not in the situation room advising [[ORG]] ?
love all the cons on here rattling off missile types and " turn [[GPE]] into a glass parking lot " , [[ORG]] 's folds and now it 's " why the [[NORP]] so mad we ai n't going to war " . you lot are the only ones who want a war . because , like a [[DATE]] , you just love playing war . war breaks out , it 's bone spurs from top to bottom .
and you “ lot ” need to go back home before you turn [[GPE]] into [[GPE]] ! you got nothing here mate !
blah , blah , blah
you must have been watching [[ORG]] ... or [[ORG]] ... same thing .
love all the [[NORP]] on here screaming their vag 's off , " he 's gon na start wwiii!!!" .... then he restrains .... "he 's a coward ! ! " . much like not knowing what gender you are , you do n't know what side you 're on . most confused people i 've ever seen .
there 's nothing mutually exclusive about trump being both a coward and starting a war , but logic was never you strong suite was it ?
i surely would not broadcast what i was going to do to them .
and , make sure to slather every bomb with bacon before delivery
no need for a ground war . just use cruise missiles , and stealth aircraft to destroy their oil infrastructure , and command and control facilities and then leave . let the [[NORP]] people do the rest .
do that and you will end up shipping food in to feed them . the civilized world is not ready for reducing them to a starving nation .
correct , we are waging an economic war against [[GPE]] and it is working . ramp it up a bit by destroying their ability to earn money and they will collapse .
we should start sinking their subs . they 'd never know what happened . just wo n't return to port or report in
news flash to the goebbels media ! trump does n't want to or has n't even tried to attack [[GPE]] ! the warmongers on the [[NORP]] left are throwing fits [[DATE]] because [[ORG]] did n't attack !
every lefter i see is still bawling about the general being sent to allah . the fact is we looked extremely weak by not sending the ayllatola to begin his relations with his [[CARDINAL]] virgins after having missiles land on our base .
thanks for that news bomb [[GPE]] .
i 'm here to educate the uneducated from the [[ORG]] areas .
cause i 'm guessin those rural folks are the real smart ones in the bunch .
as in the past ( like with [[GPE]] ) , we found out our old stuff worked better than their new stuff . countries in that region do n't seem to have a very good maintenance upkeep program for their planes or ships , that 's why they do n't have many ( if any ) . [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] included . so needless to say they would n't stand a chance against our newest weaponry . it 's nothing a few old precision dropped [[ORG]] 's ca nt fix .
maybe potus * can lob a few insults at 'em . he 's pretty talented in that arena
[[ORDINAL]] president in a while who was talented at anything . you should kiss his ring .
yeah ... i am sure you doing the [[CARDINAL]] knuckle shuffle is helping this situation dramatically .
why do you want war with [[GPE]] ?
and it worked in making the [[NORP]] response mute .
[[GPE]] is not going to push this far enough for us to really attack . they control their people by fear , they could not back down , so they run their mouth and fire a few missiles to act tough . they know [[ORG]] will be their worse nightmare if they over due it .
true , but i think that we are going to box them in in [[LOC]] and [[ORG]] their hand . they do n't get to have nukes . period .
the [[NORP]] regime is scared out of its mind .
if we were attacking [[GPE]] it would be for only [[CARDINAL]] reason and that is to take out their nuclear capacity . our [[ORG]] and dept . defense have been working on this for [[DATE]] . do we know that they can do this ? no . can they do this ? yes . [[GPE]] wants to know , [[GPE]] wants to know , [[GPE]] wants to know because this capability adversely affects each of them . none of the devices you have mentioned are even part of the device that will be used .
use [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] 's carrying [[CARDINAL]] smart bombs for the hostages taken in [[DATE]] . the haji 's love symbolism .
love the [[GPE]] flag on the glare shield of the lead [[CARDINAL]]
all of the above if the time comes . right now , everyone is in standdown mode over the current crisis .
it seems to me , these tomahawk missiles would be an easy take - out by the s-300 's etc . where am i wrong ? also , it also seems to be , we would be taking some losses , especially at the initial state , especially the air force . also , i noticed [[DATE]] that [[GPE]] made its statement which said , if this does not deescalate , it would lead to nuclear war . that of course is a dead giveaway that [[GPE]] would indeed , guaranteed come to [[GPE]] 's rescue now matter what we say or think and they would use nukes . as far as i 'm concerned , [[GPE]] is a far worse terror than [[GPE]] will ever be .
because the [[PERSON]] is a relatively slow , low flying aircraft , with terrain following guidance , it would mean that the [[PRODUCT]] would need to possess look - down shoot -down capability . i 'm not sure many [[ORG]] 's have that package at this time .
i was n't aware of that . thanks for the info .
ok general . [[GPE]] use nukes to come to [[GPE]] 's aid ? ever heard of [[ORG]] ?
i think so but you do n't have to get mad about it . [[GPE]] stated [[DATE]] about nuclear war . if you 're not sure what that means madam , it means both sides hurl nukes , [[ORG]] or no mad . now smarten up , ya hear me ! :-)
[[PERSON]] is not going to assure his destruction on behalf of the [[GPE]] . smarten up , ya hear me ;)
ok , ok then ! i 'll try to be smarter next time ! man , i feel like an idiot ! ! !
[[GPE]] could care less about [[GPE]]
possibly but i think you are actually incorrect about that one .
you are very wrong . the [[PRODUCT]] is not a viable defense against tomahawk cruise missiles . [[GPE]] does not want to get into a direct conflict with [[GPE]] .
really ? that sounds like something coming from a man full of pride . that really does n't fly with me boy .
it comes from a man who has actual knowledge . so you call me a man and then a boy ? your tactics come right from [[ORG]] .
as said boy , you 've got a pride problem . it 's called a ' know it all attitude ' and that really does n't fly with me or anyone else . surely you 've been told this before by others .
are you serious about that ? you very well could be correct but i honestly thought the s-300 's ( according to our own military ) is far better than what you 're thinking . where do i err and give something solid boy .
the export version is nothing compared to the version that [[GPE]] has and they use the [[PRODUCT]] , which came into service in [[DATE]] . i spent [[DATE]] in the [[GPE]] armed forces . i think i know a little more about their weapon systems and their capabilities than someone like you . for the record , i am no boy . you act like a child .
as far as knowing more about their weapons system , i think you give yourself too much credit boy . you seem to have a chip ( or log ) on your shoulder & might well take heed to the words of solomon , e.g. “ let another man praise thee , and not thine own mouth ; a stranger , and not thine own lips . ” ( proverbs 27:2 av )
i was merely pointing out that you obviously have no knowledge of such things and you should not speak of things that you know nothing about . thanks for playing .
the [[GPE]] knew where that other bum was and took him out . i for one hope we have a constant tail on the ayatollah and drop some lead on that guy asap .
given this , [[CARDINAL]] much - discussed phrase to keep in mind is ... " no war plan survives [[ORDINAL]] contact with the enemy . " or , as [[PERSON]] put it , " everyone has a plan , until they get punched in the face . "
not sure that is accurate . especially if its an [[PRODUCT]]
[[NORP]] are upset that president [[PERSON]] did n't order an all out nuclear strike on [[GPE]] .
nah ... they're still upset [[PERSON]] took out their hero [[NORP]] .
actually , they 're still upset he won in [[DATE]] ......... lol
what did you do when finally a [[GPE]] president stood up for his people . i ran
strongest economy , best president and most powerful military in the world . it 's good to be an [[NORP]] .
unless you are a mindless liberal .
there is no fixing hatred ingrained since childhood by parents .
trouble is , we already have been invaded by [[CARDINAL]] of [[GPE]] 's primary proxy groups , the [[NORP]] party . we need to eliminate that threat [[ORDINAL]] .
[[NORP]] are in alignment with [[GPE]] , trying to start a war so both respective leaders can distract their people .
put the crack pipe down and just walk away . thanks .
wow , a whole article devoted to information everyone already knows .
there just wo n't be another boots on the ground war in [[LOC]] . we have she 'd too much blood over these tribes . it 's time to start destroying economies
only under the most extreme circumstances would we use soldiers on the ground in some kind of invasion force . i do n't even know what those circumstances would be . if we attack [[GPE]] it will be taking out what ever [[ORG]] they even have . and with cruise missiles hitting known military sites . and electromagnetic attacks destroying their communication command and control . should [[GPE]] try to fly fighter planes , they will just make a few new aces of [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] pilots . as for submarines , they wo n't get out of port before getting torpedos up their rear . that 's how we will fight [[GPE]] . not with some kind of d day invasion . we wo n't need to do much more . they 'll get the message . or maybe even better the [[NORP]] people will get the message and finally revolt against the oppressive regime and take back what the [[PERSON]] took from them in [[DATE]] .
basically , we can wipe them off the face of the [[LOC]] without so much as a hiccup but , their administration is too stupid to know it . i feel bad for the good people of [[GPE]] because there are lots of them .
most all of it . whatever it takes . ;-) you do n't handicap yourself in a fight . [[ORG]]
i was hoping there was options to what we would expect . what excuse would we need to take out the nuclear sites in [[GPE]] ? well we had it [[DATE]] . i believe and expect [[ORG]] to make sure [[GPE]] will not get a nuclear weapon built . [[DATE]] i 'm gon na watch the [[LOC]] , [[NORP]] fall all over themselves with [[ORG]] attacks .
trump is a problem solver . [[GPE]] is the biggest problem in [[LOC]] . do the math and bottom line is [[GPE]] loses big time .
funny they did nt mention [[PERSON]] or [[GPE]] . quick , easy and more importantly final
correct answer : all of the above .
false ! no ground war or occupation . it is not necessary . take out all of their weapons development and uranium stockpiles , their refineries , subs , ships , airstrips , power grid , possibly a high altitude [[ORG]] , and their communications networks . all can be done in a matter of hours if not days with no ground war necessary at all .
the headline did not ask about a ground war or occupation . everything else in it looks good to me .
try actually reading the article of which you choose to discuss .
the only question in the whole article is in the headline . my post was an answer to a question . can you now add 1 and 1 ?
the mullahs did n't want to end up in a smoking [[PERSON]] heap like their head terrorist
obama dropped cash from the sky ..... ... we could try that . it might be cheaper .
nope , long term it is better , safer , cheaper to earn the respect , or fear , of your opponents , than to try and buy their friendship .
[[CARDINAL]] of the [[ORDINAL]] things to go will be [[GPE]] 's refineries . that will cripple their economy and limit their ability to wage war . no fuel makes many of their assets worthless .
use cruise missiles to make the a glowing cross , across [[GPE]] and have a satellite photo taken . would completely drive them insane
this just in . news bulletin : [[GPE]] has been placed on a suicide watch . our military is keeping a close eye on the [[ORG]] to make sure they do n't do anything to potentially harm or destroy themselves .
do not underestimate radicals ... that includes the [[NORP]] .
they have completed their machismo requirement . now they will go back to using their dupes to strike out . foolishly .
the problem with that is that pres trump has made it clear that he considers proxies ( dupes if you will ) who kill or wound [[NORP]] to be the same as [[GPE]] killing or wounding [[NORP]] ... and will respond with targeted violence - on [[NORP]] targets .
that is why i put " foolishly " at the end . dead on . literally !
drop [[PERSON]] from a [[PRODUCT]] . more devastating than a moab !
imagine the crater ?
lol ! i can see it now , moore dropping like a stone screaming " i 'm sorry [[GPE]] , i 'm sor .... "
that would be a religious attack , you know we ca n't drop pigs on [[GPE]] .
a weapon of mass delusion ... lol
you know what you call a truly " woke " [[NORP]] ? [[NORP]] ...
kind of like being an idealistic 20 yr old and realistic 40 yr old !
good one !
it ’s over . next article .
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " all of the above plus more that civilians do nt even know about .
it would be in [[GPE]] 's best interests if another nation did the next strike . [[GPE]] lost a lot of folk on flight [[DATE]] , which will prove to be accidental [[NORP]] aa activity caused by their hostile behavior for [[DATE]] .
for those of you that like to keep up with our military might and deterrence . as i write this post to you we are building the successes to [[LAW]] . many of my old colleagues are supplying the advanced high tech electronics in building this star wars like boomer . no foe of ours will ever equal our technology to build such a peace keeper . that no foes in the world .
mo foes
yo mo foes goes those pros , er , something like that .
hilarious article . it is like a defense industry lobbyist 's [[DATE]] list .
it really does break my heart to see so many people and the media taking the side of absolute terrorists simply because they hate [[ORG]] . sure they try to disguise it by using terms like " assassination " and " religious scholars " . no one hates the [[NORP]] people . we know they are forced to live under this religious fanatical govt . the harsh reality is that government truly wishes death upon all [[NORP]] , and yes even those who naively think apologizing for [[NORP]] will protect them . no , they want you dead too .
the hatred displayed by this putrid [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] goes way beyond hatred , for this is nothing short of demonic .
your pining over the wrong issue .. no one has taken the side of [[GPE]] in this . its your man in the situation room calling the shots that makes them nervous . somebody through a bucket of ice water on him last night and he is now listening but it remains to see if he can change anything . [[ORG]] has not had much luck on the international front if nk is any indication . [[GPE]] plays the long game .. they know they will be speaking to a new president in [[DATE]] and the calculus will be reset . i expect we will see a return to the status quo after [[ORG]] has moved on to something else and [[GPE]] will move forward with nuclear development .
we will have a new president on [[DATE]] .
i stand corrected .. [[DATE]] ..
what are the odds it was one of these [[ORG]] that shot down the [[NORP]] plane ?
definitely had explosion in air before hit ground ! look like bomb on board but maybe something else ! have video on web
highly likely .
a war with [[GPE]] will destroy the [[NORP]] regime and the [[NORP]] military . all the [[ORG]] need do is look at [[GPE]] and think how different president [[PERSON]] is to [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] regarding his generals and war fighting .
if we have anything to fear from [[GPE]] then [[GPE]] is in real trouble , if [[ORG]] tells the military to neutralize [[GPE]] and use all means necessary they could do the job in [[DATE]] , end of story , end of [[GPE]] as a prick in our sides . [[ORG]]
if they did n't use troops , it should take a lot less than that .
[[GPE]] would n't last long . they fought [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] with both of them having elite forces as they said , and neither side won . meanwhile the [[GPE]] tears through [[NORP]] forces like a wet paper bag ....... so does anyone really think [[GPE]] would fare better than [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] do n't think so . 😎
excellent point . it took what , [[TIME]] to decimate the [[NORP]] military ? we can easily do the same in [[GPE]] and i 'm sure [[ORG]] wo n't make the same mistake and keep ground troops there .
before everyone gets excited , remember . [[GPE]] has the best stand off weapons . missiles that can hit a [[CARDINAL]] ft . target from [[QUANTITY]] away . we do n't even have to work up a sweat and can be very selective on targets .
and [[GPE]] is [[QUANTITY]] from the nearest open water . i wonder if anybody thought about that :-)
trump is not a nation building [[GPE]] guy . if [[GPE]] gets destroyed , it 's their problem
as it should be . leave your enemies in smoking ruin , let them use their energy shoveling rubble , rather than planning attacks .
once the entire country is reduced to rubble ; he could build [[ORG]] towers everywhere :-)
walmarts too
true , right now there are [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] , just targets .
correct .
you folks have no clue of what the [[GPE]] capability 's have in stored for any of our foes . wrap your head around this [[NORP]] citizens . just [[CARDINAL]] boomer sub that have the tried and true [[PRODUCT]] nuke missiles . each have the capability those missiles can carry up to 3 to [[CARDINAL]] independent murv's. take that times [[CARDINAL]] missile bays on the boat . it can take out an entire continent within [[TIME]] . fact
mirv 's
so in your opinion , the [[GPE]] will attack using nuclear missiles from a sub ?
i do n't think he 's advocating , just sharing .
read it very slowly comrade . is that what i wrote ? no , no i didn't.
the article is about what weapons would be used against [[GPE]] , not a war with [[GPE]] . tell us more things you know .
true statement . [[ORG]] can carry standoff munitions and just sit around . it 's what they were made for .
they forgot to list [[ORG]] , and drones
but it 's getting them in there to do damage ? how easy it it for us to do that ?
trump 2020 ! !
the [[GPE]] will release a bus load of liberal socialist climate change protesters in [[GPE]] . that will send the [[NORP]] regime into hiding lickety split .
airdrop some [[ORG]] protestors to block their roads
ya sure lets spend all the money on rebuilding [[GPE]] . as if the money spent in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] was not enough .
so what do you think they did with the [[CARDINAL]] obama gave them ? what s that ? oh , it was obama so everything he did was amazing right . i know you do nt realize that obama ordered or approved of [[CARDINAL]] drone missile strikes in [[LOC]] . you do nt realize that because [[CARDINAL]] . you do nt care and [[CARDINAL]] . the media never bothered to tell you about it , or they gloated on him how strong he was on terrorists . the [[ORG]] force is strong in you ......
there is , like it or not , a [[CARDINAL]] yr grudge on both sides . if it comes to it , i do believe the [[GPE]] will leave them where they lay . it 's not in the [[GPE]] interest to destroy their capabilities and then give them back to them .
everyone here knows that [[GPE]] is the one who asked us to take out that general anyway , right ?
i say we employ the most dangerous weapon we have - [[GPE]] . send all the virtue - signaling celebrities over there to lecture [[GPE]] about wokeness . within [[DATE]] [[GPE]] will call trump and say " ok you 've made your point ; no nukes , [[GPE]] can exist , whatever you want . but you have to take them back ! "
if they want to push [[PERSON]] off a building as retaliation for their dead terrorist , i 'd say that wipes the slate clean .
you sure about your closing sentence ? [[GPE]] has got to be near the top in ' genociding ' homosexuals inside their borders .
but would we ?
trash talking little [[NORP]] bully does n't want more of this . that 's why that shot at nothing .
[[GPE]] appears to have gotten lucky . if any of our military would have been killed , [[GPE]] would have lost its [[ORG]] , air [[ORG]] , army , air defenses , oil production , and electricity
icbm 's tipped with thermonuclear warheads . for a start .
let them sweat .. unless they harm another [[NORP]] .
" nonetheless , it is by no means clear , despite [[NORP]] claims , that these advanced air defenses can actually threaten the most advanced [[GPE]] stealth attack assets . " however ' tipping our hand ' to the [[NORP]] who are most certainly present in [[GPE]] as ' advisers ' revealing just what we can , and can not do gives them some pretty valuable intelligence on our capabilities , does n't it ? is this worth it ?
[[GPE]] and [[GPE]] not fighting
" submarine or ship - launched [[PRODUCT]] missiles " since a submarine is technically a ship ( though not a surface vessel ) is n't is redundant saying " submarine or ship - launched " ?
how about , sea - launched ?
that 's definitely accurate , as opposed to air - launched .
no . a ship launches from above the surface .
true ... but a submarine is still a ship . whether the missile is launch from above or below the surface seems irrelevant . it 's still a ship - launched missile . i can definitely see the distinction between air - launched and ship - launched .
senseless argument ..... who cares .......
obviously ... i do .
got it . tell a naval officer that a submarine and a ship are the same thing and see what they say .
i did n't say they were the same . i just said submarines ( ssns / ssbns ) and surface ships ( cvns , cgns , ddgs , lsts and on and on ) are all ships . the fact that they are designed / built differently and for different purposes / missions does n't change the fact they 're all ships .
[[GPE]] .... leave it alone . does n't matter .
you 're the one that keeps coming back ..... i 'm moving on . feel free to do so as well .
the most dangerous lethal weapon to unleash on [[GPE]] . box up [[ORG]] and fake american followers in our country , and ship them to iran . that will do it ! lol ! lol ! lol !
yup . we could ship [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] and [[CARDINAL]] of [[CARDINAL]] things would happen . either they would subvert the [[NORP]] culture or [[GPE]] would execute them . either way it would be one less worry for us .
i wonder what the world 's largest defense budget can buy you ? [[ORG]] : it is the largest and most capable navy in the world and it has been estimated that in terms of tonnage of its active battle fleet alone , it is larger than the next 13 navies combined , which includes [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] allies or partner nations . it has [[CARDINAL]] deployable combat vessels and [[CARDINAL]] operational aircraft as of [[DATE]] , making it the [[ORDINAL]] - largest air force in the world , after [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] .
peace .
" how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " --yes
the problem with any war is that as soon as a country uses its best secret weapons they 're no longer secret ... from anybody .
and the [[GPE]] has weapons we do n't even know about .
all of the above !
just start ' chuting in herds of hogs ; the squealing alone would have the [[NORP]] dropping guns and running for cover .
[[GPE]] could pulverize the entire country of [[GPE]] in a [[DATE]] or [[CARDINAL]] . that is why they do not want a war .
drop aoc and squad into [[GPE]] , or would that be against [[FAC]] and a war crime ?
that 's just plain nasty !
yep . overkill .
the measured response by president [[PERSON]] shows that he is not trying to start a war . but i guarantee you , [[GPE]] is not going to listen . they have had many chances to come to the table . they want war . that 's all they know .
[[GPE]] wants nothing more than to be decimated by the [[GPE]] . whoever is left , will look for the sympathy of the rest of the world , and beg the [[GPE]] 's enemies for help and understanding . they do n't have a chance , and they know it ; yet , they continue to act as if they are " supreme " at the game . they are playing hop - scotch , while the [[GPE]] is playing chess .
they will simply continue the proxy war they have been fighting for [[DATE]] . they are cowards with a huge inferiority complex . i suppose that s the only way they can do anything as they know very well how quickly they would be devastated ...
trump launched a few strikes that killed [[CARDINAL]] high level terrorist generals , a few mid level terrorist commanders and [[CARDINAL]] terrorist troops . [[GPE]] " retaliated " and [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] were trampled in a funeral parade and a civilian airliner crashed killing [[CARDINAL]] people . trump just needs to step back and let [[GPE]] destroy itself like the [[DATE]] [[NORP]] candidates are doing .
how ? tomahawk missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc ...
when i was active during the [[ORDINAL]] [[EVENT]] , i remember the media tried to tell everyone how dangerous [[GPE]] 's military was . how their soldiers were battle hardened and would fight tenaciously fight to the death with religious fanaticism . they said the war " would [[DATE]] " . what they seemed to lack was a basic understanding that [[GPE]] , as well as [[NORP]] soldiers only fight because to not was certain death . they know they are on the side of wrong and evil . once the bombs started falling and their leaders scrambled , they begged us to take them hostage . they are poorly led , unpaid , underfed and unmotivated . they have viertually [[CARDINAL]] capability to strike at distance with any accuracy . how did that " [[WORK_OF_ART]] war " work out ? days , that s how . their soldiers were being decimated by ghosts and that s even worse than hand to hand combat . go ahead [[GPE]] . it will be much the same for you .....
thanks for your service . i have [[CARDINAL]] " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " license plates on my cars .
.... and that your sir !
i 'm sure we still have some moabs laying around - we only used one in [[GPE]] and it made quite an impact ( both literal and metaphorical ) . [[PERSON]] a couple as close as possible to [[GPE]] without killing civilians .
use drones to drop leaflets warning of air strike at various oil , missile , and nuclear production sites . then [[TIME]] drop [[ORG]] 's or use drone strikes . [[ORG]] missiles sound doable especially at the oil sites ..
another low - cost highly effective weapon - release more goats during funeral processions . they ca n't help themselves .
[[ORG]] on [[GPE]] . solve multiple problems at once .
just as you would n’t call the woods before hunting and tell the animals what weapons and grain of bullets you plan on using there ’s no way this is a definitive list of weaponry !
if done right , i would hope we could have [[GPE]] pretty well closed out within [[DATE]] or 2 , followed by mop up and hopefully proper occupational missions .
no boots on the ground . we do n't need to hold territory .
the [[GPE]] has enough tech , that not [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] would need to step foot in [[GPE]] .
we should attack with bacon bombs
since the [[GPE]] just blinked , i wonder how long it will take for [[GPE]] to act up again . i 'm predicting not long at all ! !
keep your day job the [[GPE]] with [[ORG]] does not blink ! the line is killing [[NORP]]
blinked ? i am pretty hawkish in general but if you have [[GPE]] intentionally missing [[GPE]] air bases and providing advance notice and choosing a time when there is as little activity as possible i kind of think its reasonable to give them the benefit of the doubt . be ready to strike if they or proxies do something but if they are avoiding [[NORP]] causalities i think some restraint is reasonable to hold world opinion on our side .
why even post this article ? the president made it clear that [[GPE]] is standing down and so is the [[ORG]] trying to drum up drama where there is none . you 're like a bunch of highschoolers spreading rumors .
they will use all of the above if necessary .. the days of placating those crazies are over .
can you say lopsided .... [[GPE]] destroyed in [[TIME]] .
probably [[TIME]] ... lol
i hope [[GPE]] continues to stand down but i doubt it ...... [[GPE]] received their final warning [[DATE]] .
it would be nothing short of downright absurd to put troops on the ground and risk more [[NORP]] lives when we can surgically dismantle the entire nation of [[GPE]] via aerial assault .
how about the fact [[GPE]] is watching the show ..
[[PRODUCT]] missiles to take out all sams and crater the military runways . then follow up with b2 's to take out their [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , and oil refineries .
a generally good plan but we need to leave the refineries alone so we can take control of them once we have properly occupied the joint . then as another poster commented , we could force oil prices down at will .
not wise to destroy non renewable oil , just concentrate on the military targets . assume they can get fuel .
we would take over oil refineries , then lower oil to $ [[MONEY]] a barrel then [[GPE]] will dissolve again .
nah . that would require boots on the ground . i would prefer to conduct this operation from far away , where our guys would be relatively comfortable and safe . i 'm not sure we do n't need to keep [[GPE]] around as a counter threat to our most serious foe , [[GPE]] .
ya , right . why did n't they do this when they fought [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] ? the [[GPE]] has been over there [[DATE]] .
[[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] 's that just flew by [[GPE]] might have something to do with it . thud .
i wonder how many moabs can fit into one [[PRODUCT]] ? i wonder if [[NORP]] like pancakes lol ?
[[CARDINAL]]
[[ORG]] , and cruise as well , and [[QUANTITY]] of other ordinance .
[[GPE]] are simple and put no friendly forces at risk . just a suggestion ...
i think we could use a curtiss - wright jenny and a box of hand grenades and they would surrender .
... or all the above !
we 're using [[PERSON]] 's boring machine to dig a tunnel under their uranium refining facilities .
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? i prefer " all of the above "
if we were to wage war with [[GPE]] , we would need to fight until an unconditioned surrender , ala [[GPE]] . that would require we reconstruct their society much as [[PERSON]] did on [[GPE]] . it did work in [[GPE]] but it is not an easy task . what we do n't want is another [[GPE]] . we do not want to wipe out their government and destabilize their military and then leave . that is a recipe for ww3
a nuclear [[ORG]] over [[GPE]] would demonstrate nicely how vulnerable they are .
how about raw bacon bombs , [[QUANTITY]] drums of bacon grease .
mother of all bacon bombs . splat .
q - how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? a - it wo n't .
why waste time speculating on what the [[GPE]] could do ? there are many options , but listing them is a non story .
we could also drop manure bombs from the sky , speculation gives these clowns something to stay employed . i say we round up all the [[GPE]] liberal elitists and bomb [[GPE]] with them as well .
nice , move [[GPE]] as a whole , put them in a [[PRODUCT]] bubble in [[GPE]] . but tell them they are acting .
[[CARDINAL]] limo , [[CARDINAL]] bottle of champaign and food . all of hollywoods elites fight for survival .
this is an excellent idea , most are too stupid to have a clue anyways .
president [[PERSON]] channels president [[PERSON]] 's foreign policy : " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
anyway we dam well please !
give [[GPE]] the green light .
to do what ? if [[GPE]] believed it could win a conventional war with [[GPE]] , they would of [[DATE]] .
i do feel the [[GPE]] believes it could go toe to toe with [[GPE]] and win . however , [[GPE]] also knows if they strike [[GPE]] , they will also be fighting the entire [[LOC]] with now support . [[GPE]] would be of no use . [[GPE]] probably would sit on the side line . [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] would fall on the side of [[GPE]] which leaves only the [[GPE]] and the [[NORP]] for the most part either hate [[GPE]] or are ambiguous toward them . [[GPE]] striking [[GPE]] would probably be the beginning of wwiii .
think he was speaking more to hezbolla(iran ) and [[NORP]] . many of which are backed by [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] does't need a green light from us . they show considerable restraint , are n't even in lock step with us on these latest dealings with [[GPE]] .
the simple threat of these means is all it will take . no attack needed
[[GPE]] does not respect threats . they are fanatical and will not admit their own actions result in consequences as in the killing of their general .
i 'm going with [[ORG]] since he just moved a large fleet of them [[TIME]] into the region .
this obsession with destryoing others using violence , will [[CARDINAL]] day destroy the self
that 's how we got our beautiful country . because all that violence gave you the freedom to be so selish , critical , and a baby . grow up !
so true ! i ran your day is up .
the ' [[WORK_OF_ART]] bomb , last used on [[LOC]] , dropped on [[GPE]] .
the best deterrent [[GPE]] has in responding to [[NORP]] terrorism is the willingness to use the weapons we have , with impunity , until it becomes obvious that [[ORG]] meant what he said .
enlist the [[NORP]] to help ... oh wait , [[PERSON]] abandoned them .
good thing [[LOC]] and [[GPE]] stepped in to help ... oh wait ? !
and the [[NORP]] would do what by themselves ? as usual troll , you make no sense whatsoever .
sea , air , land ?
how about you just shut up , good thing these folks were not around during [[EVENT]] .
all of the above ?
how about this ... you so - called journalist report the news after the fact and forgo the speculation on what we " might " do . there are planners in [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] responsible for military action and reaction . they will let you and the enemy know what they are going to do at the appropriate time .
the [[ORDINAL]] thing we should do to contain [[GPE]] is to get rid of their allies in the [[ORG]] .
i think it might look great from our view and terrible from [[GPE]] 's view .
the concern here is our own view .
and what is that .... a liberal view or [[NORP]] view ?
why do n't you just figure out for them what we are going to do ? [[PERSON]] , did you mail this piece to [[GPE]] ? are you trying to look smart ?
this is not rocket science . a high school kid could figure this out , i would hope the [[NORP]] are n't that dumb .
is n't this a desirable time to test drive [[CARDINAL]] of our hyper - sonic blasts - from - the - past toys ? creating a large blackened stain on the ground would be a nice deterrent for all ... and even cause [[GPE]] to back off [[DATE]] to re - enter catch - up mode ...
we can inflict the most pain and suffering on the [[NORP]] people by letting them live with their current government .
une-2011 : president [[PERSON]] has authorized [[CARDINAL]] drone strikes in [[GPE]] since he took office in [[DATE]] - columbian journalism review ( and others ) .
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , libya(started a war here ) . but who was he after in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] ? the generals proxy troops . including the [[NORP]] he killed with a missile strike from a drone . along with the [[NORP]] kid .
the [[PERSON]] is so mad he wants his untraceable cash back from the [[NORP]] .
is it me , or does anyone else see a need to limit our options in a public forum seems like a bad idea ? let ’s surprise them , everybody loves a surprise !
are you under the impression that anything secret was mentioned here ?
not at all , i am questioning the article perception that we are limited in our response .
how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? yes , and [[GPE]] knows it .
if the [[GPE]] attacks [[GPE]] directly , it will destroy all communications and radar in [[TIME]] , just like in the war with [[GPE]] . after that , it will be easy .
easy ? the initial phase of the operation would be exactly what you stated . once the air has been won , which would not take very long a ground assault would prove to be very deadly . i would figure resistance to any ground invasion from inside the country would deal countless loses . not to mention [[GPE]] will bring home all the [[LOC]] militias loyal to them in order to help with the house to house ground fighting . an operation in [[GPE]] would be no were close to [[GPE]] in terms of overall casualties . [[GPE]] would be [[GPE]] 2.0 .
[[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] said exactly the same thing and promised the " mother of all battles " . how did that work out ? also , the idea that we need a ground invasion of [[GPE]] is silly . if we have to go to war , it will not be to gain territory but to eliminate hostile politicians . in the case of [[GPE]] , it can be done from the air . the only necessary ground invasion would be to destroy nuclear facilities .
[[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] would take care of them .
after that , the [[NORP]] people would rise up and take care of the mullahs for us .
i 'm not so sure of that , they are brainwashed worse then the [[NORP]] are here .
give them enough time without power , and the lack of food that will follow . any country would be in chaos . even the [[GPE]] .
why would we in our right mind send in ground troops ? ? we could destroy the country from the air ! !
the air in [[GPE]] ( remote controlled , gps guided , fire and forget ) .
is it just me or would it be a good idea to keep all this secret ! ! ! ! ! !
i hear the rail gun needs more testing ... same goes for the hyper - sonic cruise missile .
[[GPE]] is like a big dumb football jock who brags about the size of their private parts .
june-2011 : president [[PERSON]] has authorized [[CARDINAL]] drone strikes in [[GPE]] since he took office in [[DATE]] - columbian journalism review ( and others ) .
[[ORDINAL]] name [[ORG]] . last name [[ORG]] . [[PERSON]] !
yeah , the one who [[PRODUCT]] the prom queen - reference to movie [[WORK_OF_ART]] . well , maybe not you - reference to movie [[ORG]] . see how that works ?
is that you [[PERSON]] or [[ORG]] ? ? ?
that 's what [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] thought . why do n't you ask them ... oh wait ... they 're dead . never mind .
it 's not bragging if it 's true .
so says the " little " man
the [[PERSON]] know that precise [[NORP]] attacks would degrade their military past the point of being able to defend the country and leave them vulnerable to internal revolution . they 're going to continue to bark like a small scared dog , do nothing and hope to survive .
" how might the [[GPE]] attack [[GPE]] ? [[PERSON]] missiles , [[PRODUCT]] stealth bombers , [[PERSON]] , carriers ? " yes to all of the above .
i could see the generals planning a strike awaiting the presidents go ahead . drone take out air defense , followed by tomahawks for the air bases , bombers to flatten military bases , and finish off out of reach nuclear facilities with stealth jets before he can finish his ice cream .
i m sure multiple contingency plans have been drawn up in advance . plans arranged like a buffet meal of selections . appetizers , main menu selections , and desserts . plans .... never go anywhere or do anything without .
we would not send aircraft over [[GPE]] as they field a very strong sam network . our aircraft would be chewed up . i would expect both sea and air launched cruise missiles , ( totaling [[CARDINAL]] ) targeting power and communication systems .
[[CARDINAL]] tac nuke right into [[NORP]] lap
