and they do n't even know [[ORG]] !
sure hope they have good security . you can bet the [[NORP]] are looking for data on this .
ok guys ..... what is to prevent an unfriendly ship ( but under circumstances that the [[GPE]] command is hesitant to shoot at ) from just tying onto one of these with a good strong rope and hauling it off to their country to study , copy , and learn how to defeat ?
you mean like [[GPE]] already has done before ?
what a waste of money .
just hope the droid control ship does n't get destroyed by some kid in a star fighter .
where were the [[ORG]] manned patrol boats when i was in [[GPE]] ? great idea
the [[ORG]] ought to make these things explode when rammed by another enemy vessel .
who says they do n't ?
what happens when the [[ORDINAL]] attack is the satellite that controls them ? or jamming the frequency ?
the [[CARDINAL]] thing about ships like this are that the whole thing can be geared up for weapons . no need for a ships mess or berths or water supply or heat or air . just armed to the gills . awesome long overdue !
the difference between [[ORG]] is : we have the hardware and then say we do n't , [[GPE]] says they have the hardware , but they really do n't .
are these drone ships like the sea hunter stealthy ? or is that too expensive ? it seems to me from the picture above that it is big enough to be readily located by radar .
" .. a single software solution across all domains .. " let 's just hope an enemy does n't find a way to hack into it , and turn the machines against us .
judgement day .
