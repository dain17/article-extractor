looks like a [[EVENT]] glider reboot .
the [[GPE]] marines could save [[QUANTITY]] of money if they delegate the development and production to some junior high school students .
the [[ORG]] could save [[QUANTITY]] on the drone if they switch to [[ORG]] , they can save [[PERCENT]] or more
simple enough even a jar head could do it . sorry i could n't resist .
make them so they can carry illegal immigrants back home
you can bet the cost of this cardboard box is more than the cost of your average car . nothing the military does is cheap . the purchasing department will make sure of that .
a disposable drone that is just left on the ground to slowly decompose may seem wasteful . obviously the author has never been in a combat theater . the amount of waste is staggering , the means of disposal is always by burning or blowing it up . not a lot of enviromental concerns in combat .
brilliant ! looks like those old 50s [[ORG]] cargo planes .
i bet the cardboard boxed used to build that drone was handed down from [[ORG]] .
only a [[ORG]] can take trash and make a effective fighting machine out of it the air force can take a boy to boot - camp and when he is done well you still have a boy
just put the bomb in it , fly it to where the target is and let it crash .....
litter bugs .
" a disposable drone that is just left on the ground to slowly decompose may seem wasteful , but it solves the problem of not allowing someone access to the technology in more complex drones if they happen to go down , ... " i translate . the government could not find a [[NORP]] smart enough to fly a drone !
looks like a cost effective and safe way to deliver supplies / ammo etc to fobs
i think they called these gliders back in [[EVENT]] with [[CARDINAL]] exception , remote control , although i believe they even had that during the time .
yep . but the r / c could n't take the drone off a pilot did that , then parachuted into the [[NORP]] channel to be hopefully recovered while the drone flew to destination .
bares a striking resemblance to the [[GPE]] glider of [[EVENT]] which my father flew .
or a baby step - child of a b-24
why would anyone care how it lands if it 's disposable and only going to be used one time ? i think a self - destruct button would be useful and certainly more entertaining ! haha
it looks like something all those great people south of the border would love to get there hands on
[[GPE]] can use something similar to sneak their avocados into the [[GPE]] .
forget the avacados fly in the [[WORK_OF_ART]] !
other than the pointy thing on the front of it , it looks like something my friends and i built when we were kids .
would be good if this could be produced and sent to deployment areas semi - assembed , flattenened or , broken down then quickly assembled , loaded and launched from a truck mounted catapult
very cost - effective , and kinda cool too .
looks more like cardboard box . can it deliver for [[ORG]] ?
[[DATE]] joke ? if so , someone went through a lot of trouble to put the website together along with cooperation from [[GPE]] .
[[ORG]] drone
cardboard boxes from [[ORG]] , balsa wood and rubber bands ?
thinking the same thing ... and tape ...
do n't get that thing wet , it will get soggy and fall out of the sky .
put [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] in it and drop it in the [[ORG]] . do that for [[DATE]] and [[ORG]] will be repaired .
looks like a depiction of a [[PRODUCT]] assault glider .
just remember . the enemy will use them parts to build a fart machine .
make that a planet buster fart machine .
in the [[ORDINAL]] world environment where use is more likely , [[NORP]] can turn the left overs into affordable housing . lol
[[PERSON]] km ? i am a jarhead and this does not compute .
hope they did n't give you the map- a grid square is [[QUANTITY]] .
the other jarhead got the map . i got the box of crayons for marking on the map . they were delicious .
does raw umber taste different than [[PERSON]] ?
click , click , click , click .
you must have been in [[GPE]] ... a “ click ” is [[QUANTITY]] , and [[CARDINAL]] lbs / kg
us pogues got fancy mraps for our patrols and did n't have to rely on our cadillacs . blue force trackers took out a lot of the guess work
km = a click
[[PERSON]] see why did n't they just speak [[LANGUAGE]] to begin with
looks like a great plane to shuttle the [[NORP]] leadership in ....................
the green new drone , very good .
finally an [[PRODUCT]] one suitable for trump :) ( oops we forgot to pack the parachute )
" the u.s. marines have been testing a new type of drone , one that 's only designed to be used once , ... " gee , i thought those were called " cruise missiles " , used once with a bit of a punch at the end ?
[[ORG]]
i think it is brilliant ! in war time , supply trains can get cut and/or stretch for [[DATE]] . being able to deliver ordinance , supplies , or emergency relief quickly is often key for survival .
so it 's an un - powered glider , not really a " drone " .
a [[ORG]] is not always a drone . drones are fully autonomous vehicles . [[ORG]] have a remote pilot . so . it could be a drone
only the [[NORP]] would build a drone out of duct tape and cardboard ... hopefully they also used crayon to mark up the tail number .
and it works ! ! lol
i bet the price is not disposable . there is always an appropriations war between [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] . i have seen it up close . and the [[NORP]] get the [[ORG]] left overs . even on the carriers . but [[CARDINAL]] real difference is that the [[ORG]] can not hold back [[ORG]] from launching to protect [[NORP]] on the ground . other then that the [[NORP]] get the last of everything . ospreys , harriers and spent [[DATE]] . but they do [[CARDINAL]] hell of a job with hand me downs and left overs . [[NORP]] come from the crucible . they have done a fairly good job at minimizing the pc culture that the rest have succumbed to . a marine aviator is a force to be reckoned with .
cheap and good . always a winning combination .
what s with all the metrics ? we are still using the kings standard measuring system darn it . i ca n't absorb this data .
grow up and join the rest of the world .
[[PERSON]] !
beat me to it .
hey this is how we make our rc planes out of foam board . this is thinking outside the box ! ! !
they worked with [[ORG]] to recycle old cardboard boxes
hey ... we should call it a spacecraft and sell seats to the neo adventurers with more money than sense ... just need a couple of jato tubes and some jumpsuits ...
next step ... cardboard gliders ... it already looks like a flying box ...
that 's what this is . they drop it from on high
i rather see a flying [[ORG]] !
they call them " [[PERSON]] 's " .
not a hard thing to do really . make it so it does not come back .
[[QUANTITY]] payload ? not bad at all for something disposable .
re - purposing tech . i can see the mechanics of these drones being recovered and re - purposed . the simpler the tech , the easier the re - purpose .
it looks like it 's made from taped - up cardboard boxes .
they covered the [[ORG]] logo
wooden boxes
looks like a school project
cool but why not publish the report in [[ORG]] units instead of metric ..
