I believe it was National Geographic that did a special on that technology where they were filmed using it on real drones in training exercises, which was pretty amazing to watch and was already achieving a perfect success rate in those drills aboard one of our destroyers.  That came out well over a year ago so I have to imagine they've made big advances since then, in the wake of these attacks id expect to see that tech begin to get rolled out at a much faster pace going forward.  \n\nAs far as attacking non-military targets such as these oil fields in this manner, they are right, we'd have no chance of even deploying the tools we do have in time to prevent it.",
