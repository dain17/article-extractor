emp weapons to counter . microwave beam to fry . hack it . trenches , boulders , paint , tar and related . [[PERSON]] it [[ORG]] 's will make it a toy .
[[ORG]] vs decepticons ?
watch battle bots .
deploy to the chop zone in [[GPE]] and let them rip !
no causalities .
it ’s racist to only send robots to war .
stop sending [[GPE]] your money via amazon people !
the opening scene of [[WORK_OF_ART]] flashes .
which ever side that has faster and more intelligent ai algorithms will win !
wait [[TIME]] ... will any of the robots be black ?
time for [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] is also developing [[PERSON]] . they will eclipse our research within [[DATE]] . if they win this race , if they get it before we do , there will be no [[ORDINAL]] chance for us . we will not be able to catch up . i can not stress enough how critical it is that they do not beat us at this . this has gone from scifi terminator realm to already having practical examples in narrow fields . you think [[GPE]] with nukes is bad ? wait till you see what a system with the intellectual capacity of a couple 100 [[PERSON]] 's can do in the hands a country that wants to demolish you .
it will start with high tech robots and end with sticks and stones .
[[GPE]] like the [[NORP]] vs. [[ORG]] vs. trump - schumer vs mitch - etc . etc . etc .
a war might start out robot on [[PERSON]] , but as soon as one side ran low on machines or out it would move to human soldiers and if close in [[ORG]] both sides would be back to human on human pretty quickly ..
since most of the the " integrated chips " are made in [[GPE]] and if the [[GPE]] has a skirmish with [[GPE]] , would n't the [[GPE]] be sending the parts back to the " maker " of the [[ORG]] 's in [[GPE]] ?
what would robot vs robot look like ? hmmm ... i guess something like [[FAC]] ? [[ORG]] vs [[ORG]] ? [[PERSON]] ? it would be interesting to watch [[CARDINAL]] robots go at each other . will [[PERSON]] be putting this event together ?
nothing that a little [[ORG]] wo n't cure .
[[GPE]] robots , [[NORP]] robots all made in [[GPE]] . i like my chances .
watching " eye in the [[LOC]] " is the perfect movie to explain why we have n't won wars since ww2 . [[GPE]] knows this and will have a huge leg up on [[GPE]] for unmanned weapon systems for [[DATE]] to come .
i did not read this but - ! ! ! bang ! ! ! - we launched our nukes because our robots were loosing .
a scrap yard .
spaceballs : the radar is jammed
craziness . movies coming to life
really did n't the guy who wrote this watch terminator as a kid .
so how does this work ? will it be like that [[WORK_OF_ART]] episode “ [[WORK_OF_ART]] ” where the computers duke it out and then calculate how many people are sent to the evaporation chambers ? then people just peacefully march to their deaths ?
this is already being done . its called " [[WORK_OF_ART]] . "
