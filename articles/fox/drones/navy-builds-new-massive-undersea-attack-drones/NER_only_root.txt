what 's long and hard and has no seamen ? that joke is ruined forever [[ORG]]
did you send press releases to our potential enemies before telling the entire world about this new stealth weapon ? what ? do you have an ad guy running things at the [[ORG]] ?
keyport wa just recieved the [[ORDINAL]] . and it 's impressive !
an excellent proof of concept would be to set one of these loose in [[LOC]] to find [[PRODUCT]] .
without an umbilical cord attached how is it controlled ? i did not think you can pass data through water ? ai sounds like a really bad idea . skynet is cool with it though .
should 've been doing [[DATE]] .
[[CARDINAL]] contract ? i doubt that ... [[MONEY]] .
cool !
semper fortis ! ! !
exactly how does this information get released to the public ?
[[CARDINAL]] of the [[ORDINAL]] step towards autonomous robotics in a large scale
not sure i trust " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " for launching attacks , i mean we 've seen what self driving cars are doing ... yikes ! hope these are not running windows ...
“ the orca xluuv is a multi - phased , accelerated acquisition program featuring a full and open competition for industry to design , fabricate , test and deliver systems to the fleet , ” .... ok . so there ya go .
i like this idea much more than the new autonomous surface craft the [[ORG]] is working on . these vehicles will be much harder to detect . no doubt , there will be lots of uses for this . i really love the way the navy is not sitting on its hands . it ’s thinking about future weapons and tactics all the time .
looks like a re - purposed high speed rail car from [[GPE]] 's darling train system .
the world of robot terminators and [[GPE]] is rapidly approaching .
i admit to being naive , but is this the kind of thing we wish our potential adversaries to be aware of ? i imagine , with the number of [[NORP]] in our universities , it 's difficult ( impossible ) to retain secrets . why we allow the [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] students privy to so much of our tech information seems unwise to say the least .
we have too many $ ubmarines as it is ! ! !
i envisioned some futuristic drone modeled after a manta ray and bristling with torpedos only to find a rendering of a submerged tampon applicator . ... i 'll admit the rendering looks much more practical .
makes sense . a drone can be lost with no loss of life . just like the airborne variant .
look out ... here comes [[GPE]] .
and we need to know this why ? ? ?
well someone has been using their brains . these little drone are going to work out better then the large subs we have now . very hard to track small target about the size of a whale . to bad they do n't us whale call for sonar or data transfers . go [[ORG]] .
[[ORDINAL]] it was [[GPE]] , now we have [[ORG]] ! not the hair spray !
columbia is the gem of the ocean ! !
[[ORG]] builds *
is it connected to [[GPE]] ?
can this u - boat survive depth charges & hedgehogs ?
send'em after the [[NORP]] navy !
dang . i just got my suas license for my aerial drone . i 'll have to get one of these underwater drones and another license ! more toys ! whee !
we keep getting better at killing each other .
i wish they would quit giving updates to our enemies . i hope they all have self destruct mechanisms so we do n't share like the drone with [[GPE]] .
