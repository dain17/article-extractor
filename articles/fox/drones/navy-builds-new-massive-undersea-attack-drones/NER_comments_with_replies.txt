what 's long and hard and has no seamen ? that joke is ruined forever [[ORG]]
did you send press releases to our potential enemies before telling the entire world about this new stealth weapon ? what ? do you have an ad guy running things at the [[ORG]] ?
keyport wa just recieved the [[ORDINAL]] . and it 's impressive !
an excellent proof of concept would be to set one of these loose in [[LOC]] to find [[PRODUCT]] .
what a waste of time and resouces .
the problem with waiting till there is a need then building ships is that you lose the war in the interim . building ships takes time and it 's usually your current line up , built in peace time that you end up depending on .
without an umbilical cord attached how is it controlled ? i did not think you can pass data through water ? ai sounds like a really bad idea . skynet is cool with it though .
electromagnetic waves in the elf and slf frequency ranges ( 3–300 hz ) can penetrate seawater to depths of [[QUANTITY]] , allowing signals to be sent to submarines at their operating depths .
thanks for the info . so that thing will be completely autonomous at the [[PERSON]] depth which i am guessing is its main stomping ground until it is needed .
the newest [[ORG]] sonar systems can identify another vessel over [[QUANTITY]] away and even tell the difference between a sperm whale and [[ORG]] . ever hear of encryption to mimic a pod of porpoise ? neither have i but then after [[DATE]] i must join [[LOC]] in admitting that i now know nothing . intelligent but smart enough to admit i 'm basically illiterate .
i am worried about crimson tide scenario more than anything . btw your reply was perfect .
should 've been doing [[DATE]] .
they likely have been .
you know we have n't ?
[[CARDINAL]] contract ? i doubt that ... [[MONEY]] .
cool !
semper fortis ! ! !
exactly how does this information get released to the public ?
ya they are nt telling you everything this thing can do . just had to make it be known we have them
this is the " suitable for the public " version
[[CARDINAL]] of the [[ORDINAL]] step towards autonomous robotics in a large scale
not sure i trust " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " for launching attacks , i mean we 've seen what self driving cars are doing ... yikes ! hope these are not running windows ...
“ the orca xluuv is a multi - phased , accelerated acquisition program featuring a full and open competition for industry to design , fabricate , test and deliver systems to the fleet , ” .... ok . so there ya go .
i like this idea much more than the new autonomous surface craft the [[ORG]] is working on . these vehicles will be much harder to detect . no doubt , there will be lots of uses for this . i really love the way the navy is not sitting on its hands . it ’s thinking about future weapons and tactics all the time .
true . and our new [[ORG]] will probably rarely leave [[GPE]] .
looks like a re - purposed high speed rail car from [[GPE]] 's darling train system .
no , we never got that far ... and it apparently works .
the world of robot terminators and [[GPE]] is rapidly approaching .
i 'd rather have a computer decide personally
i admit to being naive , but is this the kind of thing we wish our potential adversaries to be aware of ? i imagine , with the number of [[NORP]] in our universities , it 's difficult ( impossible ) to retain secrets . why we allow the [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] students privy to so much of our tech information seems unwise to say the least .
we have too many $ ubmarines as it is ! ! !
yes we should be paying more for those " unwilling to work "
looks like i triggered the squids ! ! !
far from triggered little fella .... it looks like your wrong again
i envisioned some futuristic drone modeled after a manta ray and bristling with torpedos only to find a rendering of a submerged tampon applicator . ... i 'll admit the rendering looks much more practical .
makes sense . a drone can be lost with no loss of life . just like the airborne variant .
look out ... here comes [[GPE]] .
and we need to know this why ? ? ?
well someone has been using their brains . these little drone are going to work out better then the large subs we have now . very hard to track small target about the size of a whale . to bad they do n't us whale call for sonar or data transfers . go [[ORG]] .
unfortunately , they have the same liabilities as other unmanned craft - counter measures .
laws may loosely govern unsupervised , unmanned vehicles with kill capabilities , but i 'd hate to be the one actor without a viable platform for neutralizing such threats .
[[ORDINAL]] it was [[GPE]] , now we have [[ORG]] ! not the hair spray !
[[ORG]] will stop it i bet . you spray that stuff on your hair , your style will survive [[QUANTITY]] an hour wind lol
columbia is the gem of the ocean ! !
[[ORG]] builds *
is it connected to [[GPE]] ?
can this u - boat survive depth charges & hedgehogs ?
at depths of [[QUANTITY]] , gon na be hard to track much less hit , pressure is unfathomable at the depth ! ! see what i did there ?
u boats were [[NORP]] , depth charges and hedgehogs are also outdated . now adays they have asrok and other neat toys . it does n't matter if it did n't survive an attack , the beauty is that no [[NORP]] lives would be lost .
[[ORG]] udaloy class uses a form of hedgehog in the rbu-6000 .
probably not , but i bet it 's very hard to hit .
send'em after the [[NORP]] navy !
i 've got money that our sub fleet has the sound signature of every [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , and dprk boat cataloged programmed into it 's combat information systems and can send those boats to the bottom before the bad guys know we are even there .
dang . i just got my suas license for my aerial drone . i 'll have to get one of these underwater drones and another license ! more toys ! whee !
we keep getting better at killing each other .
i wish they would quit giving updates to our enemies . i hope they all have self destruct mechanisms so we do n't share like the drone with [[GPE]] .
