bah . they were probably flying around , trying to find something to lie about anyway . good job , drone guy !
i saw the newscast . talk about drones .....
drones need to be classed as aircraft and should require active transponders and beacons . no doubt they will wait till an airliner engine eats one and kills [[CARDINAL]] of people
the real fix is for the drone pilots to fly responsibly and stay below [[QUANTITY]] and not fly into their restricted areas . as a professional licensed drone pilot , i can tell you , the thing are dangerous as all git - out . they can be a lot of fun to fly but everyone just needs to do what they are suppose to do . as for the helicopter , they need to abide by the rules too and stay out of the [[CARDINAL]] ft airspace unless landing in designated areas . i have had 2 incidents ( close calls ) with helicopters . i realize this copter was at [[CARDINAL]] ft
when drones cost " professional " prices , like sophisticated r / c planes ( i 'm a professionally certified r / c / hot air balloon pilot btw ) that were previously used for things like inspections etc we 'll see a reduction in risk , but the advent of the $ [[MONEY]] model and poorly implemented registration / geo fence system has me wondering if these things flooded the market with a secondary intent . unless licensed you should have a [[CARDINAL]] ft limit on these toys . we do n't license kites do we ? we should , if you check injury stats for those you 'd be shocked ( literally )
aliens . the outer space kind , not the illegal border crosser kind ...
" ... the pilot and reporter on board reported hearing a bang and feeling as if an object struck the tail of the aircraft . " " ... an image shared by [[PERSON]] showed dents and holes on a portion of the helicopter ... " was the pilot flying straight forward or sideways ? how do you not hit the " drone " with the fuselage but hit it with the tail ? how about " oops , we flew into an broadcast antenna but let 's not tell anyone . "
the chances of that strike are astronomical ... i d look into mechanical problem w the helicopter over " discovering a [[CARDINAL]] on [[LOC]] "
[[GPE]] ? oops . here comes the additional convoluted , complex drone laws .
no , actually [[GPE]] 's laws are right in line with federal law . i think they may have put them out [[ORDINAL]] though .
yes , actually , cali is infamous for bogging down everything with more laws . we 'll just wait and see .
they were probably occupied with an assault on plastic straws when they wrote it . somehow it came out reasonable .
how do we know that the drone was n't at legal height , hovering over the city , and the chopper flew into it ?
the drone is at fault either way . drones are not allowed by the [[ORG]] to fly above [[CARDINAL]] ' under any conditions unless it is an mq-9 predator .
not a [[PERCENT]] correct statement except it would be the drones fault . if they were near a tall building they could be at that [[DATE]] ' mark .
no , that is wrong . they can not legally fly [[QUANTITY]] above ground level .
i would think an exception would be needed to fly at [[DATE]] ' . in fact , what locations have buildings that tall in the [[GPE]] ? [[GPE]] and [[LOC]] ? there may be a total ban in flying civilian drones in those cities as in [[GPE]] . try to take a drone off the ground around [[GPE]] and you will get a message on the controller panel .
you jumped right to the comments do n't you ?
because those in power said so . that 's the way [[GPE]] works now .
it is in [[GPE]] the strike was on the leading edge of the stabiliser which some say work and others say they do not . i was in a pilot training in squadron with [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] 's . the drone should not have been in the air .
[[QUANTITY]] and after [[TIME]]
so that 's how we can get rid of those obnoxious news copters . let another copter go after them . kind of like hawks going after crows . justice .
somebody is out an expensive drone . bet the drone had more than a boo - boo of damage .
in [[GPE]] , it could have been a flying chupacabra or a flying sasquatch .
[[ORDINAL]] off ; it was n't late enough for our chupas to be out and [[ORDINAL]] , our sasquatch only hang out in the [[GPE]] , plus they are really lousy fliers .
another way for the liberal media to try to make uavs look bad .
so much for the rules .
yeah ... that 's pretty much how drones have been . they 'll tighten things up when someone gets killed .
maybe her 40 lb purse flew out the side door
1100 feet ? that sounds out of range , and then [[TIME]] after sunset ? and they " think " it was a drone but no one saw anything . more likely a meteorite :-)
by the way you " imma shoot down drones " ? aside from that being unlikely unless they 're moving slowly or hovering , you 'll be arrested for that . " but muh property ! " you own the land , not the air space .
" while [[ORG]] has n't explicitly accepted that as the upper limit of property ownership , it 's a useful guideline in trespass cases . therefore , unless you own some very tall buildings , your private airspace probably ends somewhere [[QUANTITY]] above the ground " had to research that one . yes , airspace directly above your home is your private property .. to a point . i 've seen some potato cannons that have been modified to launch nets to stop drones .
and you still wo n't hit it unless its hovering or moving slowly . you 'll miss by [[QUANTITY]] if it 's moving .
maybe , but it 'll be fun to try . btw , i used to hunt squirrel when i was a teen . got pretty good at it . if i can hit a [[CARDINAL]] - 2 lb tree rat walking along a limb at [[QUANTITY]] with a .22 i 'm pretty sure i could knock a some peeping [[PERSON]] 's eye in the sky expensive toy out of the sky .
you can use the airspace above your home ... you still do n't own it . very different concepts . that is why you can put up say a large antenna , or let tall trees grow there . the armchair laywers that keep spewing this are flat out wrong . the case law they keep citing has to do with use of the land , and repayment for damages . again , use . not ownership . the [[ORG]] controls all airspace . they have explicitly said they control all air space from the where the blades of grass end , up .
at least to the top of the chimney , right ?
with so many people not believing it was a drone , i 'd like some opinions as to what it might have been .
hand of god , [[PERSON]] , coyote with an [[FAC]] rocket attached , gunfire , reindeer test flight , [[ORG]] 's fault .
the diaper trump baby balloon
could have been a seagull with a flash light in its mouth .
bird(s ) , debris from another aircraft , ice , weather sensors , shall i continue ? ? ?
i asked for suggestions on what else could have struck the [[PERSON]] besides a drone , and aside from you , everybody else proved that answering an honest question with an honest answer is beyond the capabilities that they have at their disposal . thank you for your answer .
thanks for ideas .
fake news chopper
how do you know it was a drone ?
well it was n't a goose
[[CARDINAL]] drone , i 'd say the whole bagpipe .
i did n't know obama could still drone strike civilians .
fake news reporters are not civilians , they are enemy combatants .
lol
those look like sleigh runner marks !
i hope [[PERSON]] is ok .
maybe next time drone ... maybe next time ...
this would have to be [[CARDINAL]] serious drone to be [[DATE]] ' up and to be easily operated , and be able to take on the wash of a helicopter . i 'm guessing this is n't a simple consumer drones . there are other drones in the air beyond consumer / civilian [[ORG]] .
someone using a beefier one to grab some footage for the independent film they 're making . some of the better ones allegedly have [[QUANTITY]] range so [[DATE]] ' is doable .
[[QUANTITY]] ? that is [[QUANTITY]] . the most common dji drones can go [[QUANTITY]] and way higher than 1100 ' . legally you are limited to [[CARDINAL]] ' above ground level but you can change the settings in your controller very easily to go [[QUANTITY]] ( [[DATE]] high and travel miles away from launch point .
talking about standard pocketbook ones easily purchased by [[CARDINAL]] of the [[CARDINAL]] of up and coming filmmakers in [[GPE]] yes , if you have deep pockets , you can get much better , but is you look around , you can find 1/3 mile range , decent camera , and simple control drones affordable to the starving artist .
not enough . someone must die before adequate safety measures are enforced .
maybe the chopper hit the drone ? not the drone hit the chopper
the drone had no business being where it was .
my sincere apologies .... to all involved
get used to it people . pretty soon [[ORG]] is going to be delivering your packages by drone . and even in the great wide open [[CARDINAL]] objects can not share the same space .
otoh , maybe it was a deliberate terrorist attack on the [[PERSON]] , using a drone . [[ORG]] uses drones .
here we go people . tighten up your tinfoil hats ....
♪ ♫ hey you , get off of my cloud ♪ ♫ ~ stones
you left out a hey .
and a you
i have never flown a drone , but i have dealt with rotor wash . would n't a drone just be pushed away from the aircraft ?
shhhh ! they have a narrative going . in forward flight , the wash is minimal compared to flaring and hovering .
good question ! !
it is just a made of time when terrorist use a drone to attach a stadium full of people . ca n't stop it . what we can do is control who enters this country but the [[NORP]] impede every thing we do to protect the sovereignty of [[GPE]] .
[[NORP]] use golden eagles . works well .
we ca n't watch every college football stadium every game and every baseball park every game or everywhere [[NORP]] are gathered in mass .
did they find pieces ? pretty significant damage caused by a drone . drones are plastic with plastic blades .
depends on the make and model of the drone . not all of them are kids toys [[DATE]] .
not all drones are plastic with plastic blades . sure , the cheap ones you can buy as a toy are , but professional ones ? they 're a lot more durable than that . granted , i doubt it was a drone anyway , even the high quality ones would n't have dealt well with rotor wash .
drones bill become big problems in the future
hope they catch the person flying the drone and teach them a lesson they wo n't soon forget .. tired of people who think they can fly their drones anywhere they want at any time .
we drone pilots ca n't fly our drones anywhere we want . we are highly regulated . just like our crazy society , there are some nutty drone owners out there . but the majority of us abide by the rules and have a lot of fun ! !
hey , question for you since you 're a drone pilot and probably know the answer . what is the difference between a drone and an r / c aircraft ? is there one ? are there different regulations concerning them ?
uh huh . is that like the person whose drone was taken down over my property [[DATE]] with a .12 gauge bird shot ? is that being " highly regulated " or flying them properly ? or is that like the person [[DATE]] that landed their drone on an active airport or heck , like the person in this story that just collided with a chopper ?
i guess you ca n't read . i said there " are some " ... by the way , you 're lucky you did n't go to jail for shooting down someone 's drone . you do not own the airspace above your property . the [[ORG]] does .
wrong . [[ORG]] does not own anything but they regulate air traffic [[QUANTITY]] . and anything up to that level feet is my property . same rules apply above the ground as they do below ground .. you know for mineral rights and airspace rights ... that thing you seem to have no clue about . you fly a drone over my home and hover there , i will do it again and shoot the thing down . maybe where live trespassing and recording someone on their own private property is something you allow , around here we do n't . and as the clueless found out , when the [[ORG]] arrived , flying a drone on someone else 's property is illegal . you liberals are all alike .. think you can do what you want and that private property is yours to access regardless . well many of you find out the hard way .. around where i live , we defend what is ours .
" nutty drone owners " was the term . what makes you think it was anyone other than those that were flying the drones you referenced .
it was n't a drone . learn about them before you go all crazy about them .
uh huh even though the story clearly states it was and the damage on the chopper seems to be pretty consistent with that . they hit something solid , not a bird and that is clear by the images .
i drone can not cause that kind of damage . they weight very little and are made of plastic . this impact happened on the rear of the helicopter , there would have been very little ' speed impact ' vs a ' head on ' impact . they do make larger drones that could cause this kind of damage but those are all run my professionals with the licensing and certification to use them , to which they would know better than to fly anywhere near where this could happen . the media always jumps to drones when something happen in the air .
if you look closely at the pictures you will realize the damage is to the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer . impact would have been very significant even with a small drone due to forward speed of helicopter .
correct .
that will happen more and more , you know .
does n't look like a drone strike to me - must 've been a big fast one ! ! !
after seeing the damage i do n’t believe it was caused by a drone .
why ? factor the speed of the chopper and the drone and metal on metal and you have that gash you see in the picture .
same
so what ?
i would think you would be concerned about the proliferation of drones being flown by people of little experience that may endanger people in valid aircraft such as what happened here ... but by your screen name i can see you do n't think much .
[[GPE]] sucks
but they passed a law , how could this happen ?
the " drone - free zone " signs were n't clearly visible from [[CARDINAL]] ft . we need bigger ones !
the leading edge of the right tailplane appears to be sheetmetal ( as opposed to composite ) . that said , it looks like it got hit by something traveling at a significant velocity . either that or it was punctured by something metallic . most parts in a typical drone are plastic , and so less likely to puncture .
you would think that the amount of air turbulence that those chopper blades put off would force most all drones down and away from the back end of a chopper .
since most main rotors turn clockwise , damage to the right tailplane might hint at the object hitting the blades [[ORDINAL]] , then being propelled by them forcefully enough to cause the damage even with a lighter drone . any other associated debris could have just missed the tail rotor .
[[PERSON]] . as long as it did n't bring the bird down
drones , to me , are just moving targets . fly [[CARDINAL]] over my property , you wo nt be getting it back ... at least not in one piece .
you should check out [[GPE]] shotgun shells . perfect for taking down drones
shoot down a drone and you 've violated a law that will get you thrown in jail . guess you do n't know that . so be careful .
... said local man at his trial .
you can go to jail for doing what you are hinting at doing .
so , no evidence that it was in fact a drone ?
owner of the drone should be compensated for the chopper destroying it 's property
why ? you 're not allowed to fly a drone above [[CARDINAL]] ' unless if above a building no higher than 400 ' above that structure . there is a building of [[DATE]] ' in [[GPE]] but unless the drone was within [[CARDINAL]] ' of that building it was flying where it 's not supposed to fly for exactly what happened - the likelihood of striking an aircraft .
why do people keep posting that you can fly [[QUANTITY]] above the highest building ? not true , you can only fly [[CARDINAL]] ' above ground level .
i think that was pelosi on her broom .
you should start charging [[PERSON]] for all that space she takes up in your head .
i bet pelosi stole the broom from hillary .
there are [[CARDINAL]] ends to every broom , they can both ride at the same time . no need to fight over it .
perfect . no wonder she was cranky at her briefing
i 'm hoping for [[WORK_OF_ART]] for [[DATE]] .
i have a killer drone . it 's a [[PERSON]] . killer fun !
ban drones ! oh , they already did that .
i think it was a [[ORG]] ( unidentified flying poop ) .
i do n't agree with the title , " drone " . they are not autonomous . rc planes have been around since [[DATE]] . yes the quad copters are easier to fly , but the concept is the same .
the very [[ORDINAL]] rc planes were called ' drones ' . even [[DATE]] , the old , worn out jet fighters are converted to radio control and are designated ' drones ' . so you 're spouting nonsense .
no sir , you are just agreeing other peoples none sense . have [[DATE]] .
[[PERSON]] invented drones
[[PERSON]] invented you so you could tell everybody what he invented .
that is why my momma wo n't tell me who my daddy is
the [[ORG]] will investigate since its over [[CARDINAL]] ft . hope they do nt have an insurance plan .
the sun set at [[TIME]] on [[DATE]] .... " [[PERSON]] was flying over the downtown area [[TIME]] " " just assumed it was a bird because that happens every once in a while , " reporter [[PERSON]] said . evidently , [[PERSON]] is n't aware that birds do n't fly at [[TIME]] ... the standards are pretty high over at [[ORG]] .
i let the bird fly anytime someone ticks me off , [[DATE]] or [[TIME]] .
pretty soon you will need to be certified to fly a drone regardless if it is for business or fun . if this person was part [[CARDINAL]] certified , they would have known that they can not fly [[QUANTITY]] . and those commenting about shooting drones over your house , you do not own the airspace , the [[ORG]] does so think before you take that shot .
i rarely miss .
" i rarely miss " ... said local man at his trial .
you are assuming he was n’t in the hills . he may have been at [[QUANTITY]] mall but [[QUANTITY]] above the ground . it depends on where they were .
[[ORG]] . not mall
regardless , [[QUANTITY]] above wherever he was . he could have been on a building at [[QUANTITY]] and could fly [[QUANTITY]] but we will see what pans out with this . i just hope that the [[ORG]] comes down hard on these irresponsible " pilots " so that people start taking it serious .
drone collisions will be mitigated once drones are required to have ads - b transponders .
the clutter on the screen for ads b in will be unimaginable .
dronestrike .
more likely a bird strike ... [[CARDINAL]] of aircraft have been brought down by bird strikes . barring any verifiable evidence , i 'd go with bird strike .
night time . holes on the tail . do n't think it was a bird
it was big bird
when caught these clown drone pilot should be charged with attempted murder ........ this crap of " little [[PERSON]] did n't mean it " has got to come to an end ......... whoops ...... my fault ....... this is [[GPE]] ........
it was probably just a hair clip from a man - bun .
helicopter vs drone . not hard to figure who won that one .
[[ORG]] is fake news , no proof . holes would indicate they got shot .
not the dent beside it .
where did it say they were shot at ?
drones are fun at the skeet range ...
[[PERCENT]] of drones do n't make that kind of damage unless its a [[QUANTITY]] police drone
factor in the forward speed of the helicopter .
zip it
probably some perv using the drone to window peak .
from 1000 ' ? ? even from [[CARDINAL]] they still could n't see your unit .
try again ! with the optics and cameras on the better ones you can see a lot more than people are comfortable with you seeing .
hmm . based on the type of damage , the size of dents and the distance between them , i doubt that this sort of damage could have been caused by a consumer drone . this was a lot bigger , heavier , and denser than your average [[PERSON]] or a [[ORG]] .
an alien spaceship you think ?
i 'm not saying it was aliens , but it was aliens .
i 'm thinking a black helicopter , mini version .
maybe the helicopter should 've looked out for drones ! duh !
that liberal needs to get a job , instead of playing around with his flying toys .
yeah seriously , take that helicopter away from him .
i 'm still not clear on why i ca n't shoot down drones ..
what 's stopping you ? poor aim ?
jail time and bail costs mainly . my aim is fine .
okay .
because everyone follows the law .
this was [[GPE]] ........ laws are not followed .
lol , i was being sarcastic .
y'all owe me $ [[MONEY]] for the drone you messed up .
lol
any evidence to support their claims ? no ? tt baby .
just dents on the tail . what 's the other option ? a ufo ?
do you know what ufo stands for ?
what else do you think it could be ? you know , within the realm of reality .
bird ?
just hearsay , but that 's good enough for [[ORG]] .
[[PERSON]] invented rogue drones .
16:43 is super early for a sunset . jesus
time change sucks . spring forward and keep it is what i say
the way pelosi was drone - ing on [[TIME]] i am not surprised
perhaps the drone was struck by the chopper
the dji [[PERSON]] is a definitely a hit this [[DATE]] !
zip it
with wireless cameras and drones , does n't it seem like choppers are a just a costly luxury ?
yes - when a relative has an accident and requires critical medical care quickly feel free to hover over their body and take pictures ... or you can put them on an air ambulance that can physically carry them ? just a thought ...
[[ORG]] owned and operated ? their credibility is out the window . yeah right- the drone probably said [[ORG]] on the side and was flying in [[NORP]] airspace . stop [[ORG]] . you are not believable .
you should really see somebody about your [[ORG]] , that is .
is it a " fake news " , liberal station ? because if so , they are coming for you , all of you !
wait till they start delivering packages with drones with no regard for airspace or public safety . a disaster in the making .
* sigh , .. kids [[DATE]] ....
ban assault drones
drones will be used in [[ORG]] terroist attack on the [[GPE]] .
that ’s why we need our assault rifles ..... it ’s bird hunting season
talk about an " ... entitled ... " point of view . i maintain that the drone was struck by the helicopter .
lol ... true dat .
yeah , not at [[TIME]] at [[QUANTITY]] .
[[ORG]] think they own the skies . the drone operator should sue .
that 's just ridiculous !
as mentioned , the drone operator was flying illegally , under federal and local laws .
then he should sue the federal and local governments .
maybe he should just be a bit smarter than you and eat losing his toy .
oh , the horror !
" air7hd has landed safely following a midair collision " ah bummer .
the headline states the drone struck the chopper . the article states the chopper struck the drone . millennial journalism at it 's finest .
there should be electronic tags on these things to track their user and flight path info . just plain common sense .
sure . go ahead and put an electronic tracker with all of your info on all of your shoes too .
then get your helicopter out of the way .
they hit a ufo
technically
nice ...
[[PERSON]] invented news , choppers , and drones .
and the internet . do n't forget that one ! !
stupid
yes , he invented that too !
you like licking al 's old nuts huh . sad
lolz ! even if i shared your projected passion for geezer gobbling , your head would be in the way and i seriously doubt old [[ORG]] even has nuts .
