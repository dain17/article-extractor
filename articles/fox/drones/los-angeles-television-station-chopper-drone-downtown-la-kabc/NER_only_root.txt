bah . they were probably flying around , trying to find something to lie about anyway . good job , drone guy !
i saw the newscast . talk about drones .....
drones need to be classed as aircraft and should require active transponders and beacons . no doubt they will wait till an airliner engine eats one and kills [[CARDINAL]] of people
aliens . the outer space kind , not the illegal border crosser kind ...
" ... the pilot and reporter on board reported hearing a bang and feeling as if an object struck the tail of the aircraft . " " ... an image shared by [[PERSON]] showed dents and holes on a portion of the helicopter ... " was the pilot flying straight forward or sideways ? how do you not hit the " drone " with the fuselage but hit it with the tail ? how about " oops , we flew into an broadcast antenna but let 's not tell anyone . "
the chances of that strike are astronomical ... i d look into mechanical problem w the helicopter over " discovering a [[CARDINAL]] on [[LOC]] "
[[GPE]] ? oops . here comes the additional convoluted , complex drone laws .
how do we know that the drone was n't at legal height , hovering over the city , and the chopper flew into it ?
so that 's how we can get rid of those obnoxious news copters . let another copter go after them . kind of like hawks going after crows . justice .
somebody is out an expensive drone . bet the drone had more than a boo - boo of damage .
in [[GPE]] , it could have been a flying chupacabra or a flying sasquatch .
another way for the liberal media to try to make uavs look bad .
so much for the rules .
maybe her 40 lb purse flew out the side door
1100 feet ? that sounds out of range , and then [[TIME]] after sunset ? and they " think " it was a drone but no one saw anything . more likely a meteorite :-)
by the way you " imma shoot down drones " ? aside from that being unlikely unless they 're moving slowly or hovering , you 'll be arrested for that . " but muh property ! " you own the land , not the air space .
with so many people not believing it was a drone , i 'd like some opinions as to what it might have been .
fake news chopper
how do you know it was a drone ?
[[CARDINAL]] drone , i 'd say the whole bagpipe .
i did n't know obama could still drone strike civilians .
those look like sleigh runner marks !
maybe next time drone ... maybe next time ...
this would have to be [[CARDINAL]] serious drone to be [[DATE]] ' up and to be easily operated , and be able to take on the wash of a helicopter . i 'm guessing this is n't a simple consumer drones . there are other drones in the air beyond consumer / civilian [[ORG]] .
not enough . someone must die before adequate safety measures are enforced .
maybe the chopper hit the drone ? not the drone hit the chopper
get used to it people . pretty soon [[ORG]] is going to be delivering your packages by drone . and even in the great wide open [[CARDINAL]] objects can not share the same space .
otoh , maybe it was a deliberate terrorist attack on the [[PERSON]] , using a drone . [[ORG]] uses drones .
♪ ♫ hey you , get off of my cloud ♪ ♫ ~ stones
i have never flown a drone , but i have dealt with rotor wash . would n't a drone just be pushed away from the aircraft ?
it is just a made of time when terrorist use a drone to attach a stadium full of people . ca n't stop it . what we can do is control who enters this country but the [[NORP]] impede every thing we do to protect the sovereignty of [[GPE]] .
did they find pieces ? pretty significant damage caused by a drone . drones are plastic with plastic blades .
drones bill become big problems in the future
hope they catch the person flying the drone and teach them a lesson they wo n't soon forget .. tired of people who think they can fly their drones anywhere they want at any time .
i drone can not cause that kind of damage . they weight very little and are made of plastic . this impact happened on the rear of the helicopter , there would have been very little ' speed impact ' vs a ' head on ' impact . they do make larger drones that could cause this kind of damage but those are all run my professionals with the licensing and certification to use them , to which they would know better than to fly anywhere near where this could happen . the media always jumps to drones when something happen in the air .
that will happen more and more , you know .
does n't look like a drone strike to me - must 've been a big fast one ! ! !
after seeing the damage i do n’t believe it was caused by a drone .
so what ?
[[GPE]] sucks
but they passed a law , how could this happen ?
the leading edge of the right tailplane appears to be sheetmetal ( as opposed to composite ) . that said , it looks like it got hit by something traveling at a significant velocity . either that or it was punctured by something metallic . most parts in a typical drone are plastic , and so less likely to puncture .
[[PERSON]] . as long as it did n't bring the bird down
drones , to me , are just moving targets . fly [[CARDINAL]] over my property , you wo nt be getting it back ... at least not in one piece .
so , no evidence that it was in fact a drone ?
owner of the drone should be compensated for the chopper destroying it 's property
i think that was pelosi on her broom .
i 'm hoping for [[WORK_OF_ART]] for [[DATE]] .
ban drones ! oh , they already did that .
i think it was a [[ORG]] ( unidentified flying poop ) .
i do n't agree with the title , " drone " . they are not autonomous . rc planes have been around since [[DATE]] . yes the quad copters are easier to fly , but the concept is the same .
[[PERSON]] invented drones
the [[ORG]] will investigate since its over [[CARDINAL]] ft . hope they do nt have an insurance plan .
the sun set at [[TIME]] on [[DATE]] .... " [[PERSON]] was flying over the downtown area [[TIME]] " " just assumed it was a bird because that happens every once in a while , " reporter [[PERSON]] said . evidently , [[PERSON]] is n't aware that birds do n't fly at [[TIME]] ... the standards are pretty high over at [[ORG]] .
pretty soon you will need to be certified to fly a drone regardless if it is for business or fun . if this person was part [[CARDINAL]] certified , they would have known that they can not fly [[QUANTITY]] . and those commenting about shooting drones over your house , you do not own the airspace , the [[ORG]] does so think before you take that shot .
drone collisions will be mitigated once drones are required to have ads - b transponders .
dronestrike .
more likely a bird strike ... [[CARDINAL]] of aircraft have been brought down by bird strikes . barring any verifiable evidence , i 'd go with bird strike .
when caught these clown drone pilot should be charged with attempted murder ........ this crap of " little [[PERSON]] did n't mean it " has got to come to an end ......... whoops ...... my fault ....... this is [[GPE]] ........
it was probably just a hair clip from a man - bun .
helicopter vs drone . not hard to figure who won that one .
[[ORG]] is fake news , no proof . holes would indicate they got shot .
drones are fun at the skeet range ...
[[PERCENT]] of drones do n't make that kind of damage unless its a [[QUANTITY]] police drone
probably some perv using the drone to window peak .
hmm . based on the type of damage , the size of dents and the distance between them , i doubt that this sort of damage could have been caused by a consumer drone . this was a lot bigger , heavier , and denser than your average [[PERSON]] or a [[ORG]] .
maybe the helicopter should 've looked out for drones ! duh !
that liberal needs to get a job , instead of playing around with his flying toys .
i 'm still not clear on why i ca n't shoot down drones ..
because everyone follows the law .
y'all owe me $ [[MONEY]] for the drone you messed up .
any evidence to support their claims ? no ? tt baby .
[[PERSON]] invented rogue drones .
16:43 is super early for a sunset . jesus
the way pelosi was drone - ing on [[TIME]] i am not surprised
perhaps the drone was struck by the chopper
the dji [[PERSON]] is a definitely a hit this [[DATE]] !
with wireless cameras and drones , does n't it seem like choppers are a just a costly luxury ?
[[ORG]] owned and operated ? their credibility is out the window . yeah right- the drone probably said [[ORG]] on the side and was flying in [[NORP]] airspace . stop [[ORG]] . you are not believable .
is it a " fake news " , liberal station ? because if so , they are coming for you , all of you !
wait till they start delivering packages with drones with no regard for airspace or public safety . a disaster in the making .
* sigh , .. kids [[DATE]] ....
ban assault drones
drones will be used in [[ORG]] terroist attack on the [[GPE]] .
talk about an " ... entitled ... " point of view . i maintain that the drone was struck by the helicopter .
[[ORG]] think they own the skies . the drone operator should sue .
" air7hd has landed safely following a midair collision " ah bummer .
the headline states the drone struck the chopper . the article states the chopper struck the drone . millennial journalism at it 's finest .
there should be electronic tags on these things to track their user and flight path info . just plain common sense .
then get your helicopter out of the way .
they hit a ufo
[[PERSON]] invented news , choppers , and drones .
