This impact happened on the rear of the helicopter, there would have been very little 'speed impact' vs a 'head on' impact. They do make larger drones that could cause this kind of damage but those are all run my professionals with the licensing and certification to use them, to which they would know better than to fly anywhere near where this could happen. The media always jumps to drones when something happen in the air.",

As a professional licensed drone pilot, i can tell you, the thing are dangerous as all git-out. They can be a lot of fun to fly but everyone just needs to do what they are suppose to do. As for the helicopter, they need to abide by the rules too and stay out of the 400ft airspace unless landing in designated areas. I have had 2 incidents (close calls) with helicopters.
