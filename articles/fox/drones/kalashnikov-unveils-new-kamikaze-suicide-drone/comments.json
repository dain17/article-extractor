But make this drone much smaller yet....1/3 the size and and make it's speed 3, 4 or 5 times faster......give it a range of 30 or 40 miles or greater depending on propulsion system.......and use multiple guidance systems.......I could go on with different characteristics.....and suddenly you would have a nightmare.......that could be used by most anyone and armed in various ways and how would you defend against it?......not very easily.",
