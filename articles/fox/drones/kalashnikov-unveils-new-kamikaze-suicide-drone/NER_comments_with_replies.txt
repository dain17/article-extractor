looks like the [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] shotgun is coming back ! told ya ! lol !
[[PERSON]] , i can see how it would be helpful for close support for a nation without [[ORG]] in a warzone or reliable access to artilery , which would be a [[NORP]] equiped military unit lol .
drones are rapidly becoming the most hideous weapon and misused invention of all time .
" the drone , which is [[QUANTITY]] wide , is designed to destroy remote ground targets . the manufacturer claims it could revolutionize combat in much the same way the [[PRODUCT]] did in [[DATE]] . " right . because there 's never been a [[NORP]] or oka bomb used in warfare before . the problem with single use weapons is exactly that . they can only be used once . and if you miss , oh well , no [[ORDINAL]] chances . probably why kamikaze planes and oka bombs were n't as effective as they could have been . you run out of them eventually .
big deal ..
suicide drone is a pretty spooky name -kate yelkovan
population control . the meek shall inherit the [[LOC]] , may not be much left of it .
anything that can be controlled remotely can be hacked and turned against you
nothing new under the sun ... sounds like a glorified [[NORP]] v-1 with greater accuracy .
how long a time will it be before the miniature killbots are achieved ? this is the [[ORDINAL]] step in which warfare with troops will be a thing of the past . just think . if you add facial recognition to the drone it will kill just the one target it is sent to . now imagine [[CARDINAL]] deployed the size of a large book . too small to see on radar they can be deployed from [[QUANTITY]] away from the target . they each have a single person to eliminate , such as a congressman or house member or a police chief or a mayor . no one to investigate as the weapon is blown up so no suspects to look for . will anyone be safe ?
soon we will have drone carriers and flying carriers . no place to hide when fire rains down . maybe [[ORG]] was right when the world ends in [[DATE]] and the global warming is not man made but from c02 but nuclear .
more new ways of killing each other ........ by us ‚Äú civilized ‚Äù human beings .
ha , [[NORP]] drone ... do n't we already have remote control missiles ?
how far fetched would it be to assume [[GPE]] assimilated some [[ORG]] tech while lingering in [[GPE]] . pretty much all [[GPE]] 's r&d industry reverse engineers foreign tech and slaps a red star on the side .
wow . you too . [[PERSON]] is an act not a noun . please stop .
so far , [[GPE]] is still far beyond the horizon . but , we 're getting closer . wars have always been won in a multi - domain environment . we just keep increasing the domains . the race amongst enemies is finding ways to make the new capabilities incapable , leveraging cost and reliability , and giving would - be antagonists cause to pause . if we 've been keeping up , we 're doing an excellent job of hiding it .
so - [[GPE]] has finally successfully developed its own [[CARDINAL]] rocket . nice :)
coming soon to a black market near you , just in time for the [[NORP]] bombing holidays .
wonder what the [[NORP]] will do now since their [[ORDINAL]] step in office is to declare war on [[GPE]] .
yeah hitler had this idea in [[DATE]] but manned . does n‚Äôt impress me much .
the [[GPE]] needs a drone that you can put aoc in the warhead . she 's so caustic she could wipe out an entire city without making a boom .
" high - precision unmanned projectile flies up to [[TIME]] at the speed of 130 kilometers ( [[QUANTITY]] ) per hour . " they 're gon na have to get her up to [[CARDINAL]] if they want to generate [[CARDINAL]] gigawatts .
what movie was it that a computer ran a war program , then people on each side had to voluntarily be killed ?
[[PRODUCT]] controlled phalanx will make [[NORP]] cheese out of it .
there will be anti drop weapons developer . something like the phalanx gun for the navy . though maybe an infrared beam would do it as well .
when 's someone going to load a drone with ebola and crash it into a stadium full of people ? that 's scary stuff . üò∂
this is new ? some kid attached a gun to a drone back in [[DATE]] , which they later arrested him .
[[PERSON]] aircraft ? pretty much describes their entire aerial fleet . nothing new .... move along , nothing to see here ! !
how does this differ from a cruise missile .
is n't [[NORP]] and suicide kind of redundant ?
take me back to [[EVENT]] . that 's the war i 'm lookin ' too ! the dizzy days of sweat and fear and the long long nights over a tepid beer . i 'd miss it all but the terror remains of the [[ORG]] bombs and hitlers planes .
this is not a new thing , they 've been around for [[DATE]] . [[PERSON]] is a wee behind the times there .
which is why the us military is developing a whole new generation of anti - drone systems , including vehicle mounted ones . sorry , [[ORDINAL]] - world hut dwellers will still be behind .
it 's ' manned ' ..... e.g. pilot is flying it remotely . good old fashion smoke grenades deployed in the air and on the ground will be effective against this .... as will [[ORG]] jamming devices . drones are highly effective in [[ORG]] countries where they throw rocks at the drones ...... but against the [[GPE]] ? .... different story .
i believe this is the beginning of a much bigger danger here that most realize . granted , this initial drone is not quite so lethal in many situations . but make this drone much smaller yet .... [[CARDINAL]] the size and and make it 's speed [[CARDINAL]] , [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] times faster ...... give it a range of [[QUANTITY]] or greater depending on propulsion system ....... and use multiple guidance systems ....... i could go on with different characteristics ..... and suddenly you would have a nightmare ....... that could be used by most anyone and armed in various ways and how would you defend against it? ...... not very easily .
lol the [[GPE]] has the ability to kill remotes , or anything remotely controlled and has had this ability for [[DATE]] that i know of .
so ? this is why we have awacs in the airspace . besides , ours can land and load up [[CARDINAL]] or so missiles . give a millennial a drone with a gatling gun and they will video game their way through the next war ...... just for reals and no take backs .....
" [[ORG]] ' suicide ' drone " why would n't you call it by it 's original name .... guided missile .
[[ORG]] ... cruise missile with a propeller . they had these in ww1 .
really .... lol ! we 've had those for quite awhile . they are called tomahawk cruise missiles .
meanwhile , an orbiting predator locks in on the source of the drone 's control signals and in [[TIME]] are none .
imagine what we could create if [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] worked together
let 's see how well they work against a nuke ?
what a waste of money .... you go [[GPE]] ...
just what the world needs ; another tool to kill each other for political and religious reasons . of course , someone needs to make a profit off if too . there should be beacons surrounding our solar system to warn extraterrestrials : danger , humans make war here . enter at your own risk .
um , we have had these for [[DATE]] . as they say , there is nothing new under the sun .
[[GPE]] has had these for [[DATE]] .
at 80.7 [[ORG]] it would be a sitting target .
[[DATE]] behind the [[PRODUCT]] cruise missile , this is non - news ....
for the moutherland .
uh , cruise missiles . not a new concept .
[[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] lmao , an easy target , kind of like using my quad - copter to drop dynamite
the defense exhibition in [[GPE]] is a [[CARDINAL]] stop shop for terrorist and drug kingpins .
the comment by [[PERSON]] about " democraticing " smart bombs should tell you where he stands . he 's happy that more nations than [[GPE]] and isreal can have this capability . he 's equating democracy with making deadly weapons available to hostile governments and groups . [[LOC]] much , [[PERSON]] ? what do you think this is going to do to the small oppressed minority groups in smaller [[ORDINAL]] world nations who will now stand no chance of overthrowing some oppressive regime because the regime can now inexpensively silently hunt and destroy them without having a boot on the ground , and can also deny any participation in such a slaughter . no troops , no evidence , just the crater where a village used to be .
[[CARDINAL]] of the tenets of [[NORP]] / leninist philosophy is ‚Äú quantity has a quality all its own ‚Äù . the design of the [[PERSON]] ak-47 is a perfect example as this is a fully automatic assault rifle that can be mass produced cheaply , requires little or no maintenance and is designed to shoot inexpensive steel cased ammo . while this drone provides no innovation in technology , it is a huge leap forward in asymmetrical warfare . [[CARDINAL]] of these drones launched simultaneously at a [[GPE]] forward operations base in a war zone or at a [[ORG]] building could have devastating affects for very little cost .
its very clear this product is made specifically for the terrorist market .
any weapons - carrying drone can be used on such a mission
it now joins the ranks of disposable pens , lighters , etc . of course , it 's a bit costlier .
hmmm , an exploding , self guiding drone ? you mean a missile ? wow , that 's new !
anyone can build a homemade drone and fly it into a building and set a fire using lighter fluid . ignite remotely and done .
it 's slow . [[QUANTITY]] . very interceptable and avoidable . gps guided ? a drones strengths are being a platform for weapon or surveillance that keeps it operators safe and can run back to back missions [[CARDINAL]] . it does n't replace guided missiles or bombs . what practicality does it have for countries that have a large military ? i 'd think very limited . given those military 's already have stuff that makes this obsolete before production even starts . seems like a weapon designed for terrorists to use .
i 've been bitten by the " stock " photos [[ORG]] sometimes uses but this looks like a [[PRODUCT]] flying wing available from [[PERSON]] or banggood(i swear it 's not a [[ORG]] site ) . i think there s a dude who flew a [[PRODUCT]] between 2 hi islands with nothing more than off the shelf parts and a verizone lte card
how many more ways can we find to eventually wipe ourselves off the planet ... and to think we are at the top of the food chain .
[[DATE]] buzz bomb
cops could fly a drone into a house , hit the detonator and blow the house . done you could use any chemical that could explode . lighter fluid can set fires . just ignite it remotely
in other words , a cheep cruise missile .
if it depends on gps , you lose off the bat .
" it was already been tested and is ready for use " , [[PERSON]] says .... they would say that ...
sounds like a ww2 [[NORP]] [[PERSON]] but precision .
man will someday destroy himself on the planet .
flying bombs . how [[CARDINAL]] . jam gps and they 're worthless .
soooo ... it 's a cruise missile with the ability to loiter over the battlefield for a while until you see something worth slamming into .
i think that is called a cruise missile .
this is going to work out well . going to need jamming tech to stop these things . if they could only make them home in on the source of their control signal .
c'm on , giant asteroid !
so ? [[GPE]] can make these too . [[GPE]] is n't so innovative that they are beyond our capability . for example , how is this any different than the smart bombs we make now ? i 'm not impressed .
we had a video on tv [[DATE]] more ago ! it was a " laser " pointed at a flying object , and after [[TIME]] the flying object burst into flames . if we already have that and showing it to the american public ! ! you have to wonder what we have and they are not showing us ! ! !
only deterrent would be a jamming system . they are guided somehow - gps , remote , etc .
the [[NORP]] had that in [[EVENT]] . they were called the " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " or " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . shows that [[GPE]] finally caught up to [[DATE]] technology .
is nt this just a poor [[NORP]] short range cruise missile
[[ORG]] = suicide .
[[GPE]] has em already ... heard they were powered by [[ORG]] jet engines
so , basically , you can still shoot it out of the sky with a shotgun .
does the same thing as a missile , just a different shape . it is not to fast , i seen college engineering students make drones that fly [[QUANTITY]] .
in the end the cost of warfare will win or lose a war .
[[CARDINAL]] emp ( electro - magnetic pulse ) would drop all drones , along with the entire electrical grid , phones , pc 's and all newer autos . anything with a transistor . emp 's were only possible with nukes but now can be done with conventional explosives , paralysing entire countries . [[ORG]] 's can also be used in space , knocking out communications and gps satellites , anything within [[QUANTITY]] . the next serious war will start this way and take [[DATE]] just to repair just this damage . now that 's scary ..
it would not be hard for someone to build a drone that can go through windows and take people out .
we used to call them bombs
we have alien space ships , we are way ahead of them .
in [[DATE]] , [[ORG]] introduced the drone called [[LOC]] . from the announcement : the switchblade is a loitering munition developed by [[ORG]] . it is designed as a " kamikaze , " being able to crash into its target with an explosive warhead to destroy it . the [[LOC]] is small enough to be carried in a backpack and can be launched from a variety of ground , maritime , and air platforms . i have seen a live demo out in [[DATE]] .
some of you seem to forget that we use a $ [[MONEY]] missile to take out a tank or a heavy gun . they have this tinker toy that costs a fraction of that to do the same thing . they can deploy [[CARDINAL]] times as many as we can . even if they lose [[PERCENT]] , that means [[PERCENT]] get through . i would not write this technology off so quickly .
and ? military development is the biggest driver of technical innovation & improvement . has been since the [[ORDINAL]] caveman figured out a rock can be used to bash in his neighbor 's head .
huh . believe we call them cruise missiles . had them for what , [[DATE]] ?
we 've had them for [[DATE]] . drone swarms is where it 's at . send out 500 to confuse your enemy and [[CARDINAL]] - 4 with high explosives
[[PERSON]] is the greatest contributor to world violence and suffering .
should test fire it at [[GPE]] .
[[PERSON]] is like [[PERSON]] of [[GPE]] about bragging about military weapons and about as truthful .
how much is a rc airplane at hobby lobby ? add the cellular band controls / camera for a racing drone .. cost is probably pretty low to produce these . think about the havoc old [[NORP]] rpgs or rockets from [[GPE]] cause . think about this , a child with a modern cell phone can fly these . if they are running an cellular they can smuggle them into places and fly them remotely from anyplace . low and slow will bypass many modern defense systems .
it wo nt be hard to figure out and then soon people will be bombing their cheating spouses , disgruntled work places , [[ORG]] , etc
the [[GPE]] has had this capability for [[DATE]] . typical [[NORP]] , make something that barely functions and claim a " major breakthrough " !
wonderful . bet they 're selling them to terrorists with anti western agendas . scary stuff .
a missle ?
i waiting to see how long it takes before someone uses a drone to take out these politicians who make feel good speeches outdoors on the grassy knoll or any other place for that matter .
just when liberals thought the world would finally sit around the camp fire together and drink coca - cola in peaceful harmony ... this story comes up .
" and if you act right now [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] will deliver your drone with its own drone " .
wow ! ground breaking . < rolls eyes > i 'm sure terrorists had never thought of putting explosives in a drone before now .
[[ORG]] " guided missle "
cheap way to help solve our illegal immigration problem .
a [[QUANTITY]] ? typical size of the average r / c airplane . it probably ca n't carry much ordnance . it appears to be a nuisance weapon .
a vehicle mounted xm-556 with a radar control system would be a possible solution .
[[PERSON]] invented [[PERSON]]
the thugs are already using drones to do peeping tom work looking in people 's windows and scoping out their backyards to see if they have anything worth stealing ........ only a matter of time before they start putting explosives on them for kamikaze missions ........ maybe even small nukes someday soon . no public figure or politician of any stripe anywhere will be safe anymore
man , i 'd love to fly [[CARDINAL]] of them !
[[PERSON]] is afraid of trump ! puts out garbage propaganda .
we have a whole generation of drone pilots . come get us !
excellent tool for terror that [[ORG]] nice .
i wonder how well it will perform in an [[ORG]] counter attack .
[[GPE]] already has the technology and does n't need to detonate the delivery vehicle in the [[LOC]] !
do n't worry about this . [[ORG]] is the boss and has everything under control . she ‚Äôll give the order to launch the locomotives ‚Äò at will ‚Äô .
absolutely nothing " new " about this concept , well since [[EVENT]] that is ...
it would be great fun to fly some of these drones thru the countryside during hunting season and watch how fast they get obliterated by common everyday hunters with their favorite shotguns . we could start a new drone hunting season .
waging war from the fence .....
at [[ORDINAL]] it is nothing more than a long range grenade but then it has it 's problems . it is the size of a duck and it is sucseptible to weather in particular wind and like a duck it can be blown out of the sky by a shotgun . any one who has hunted ducks knows how hard it is to make a deflection shot but these things have to come srtaight on so it is not even a challenging shot . it is much larger than a grenade making for a large bundle to carry many of these and unless you want to give away your position you better fly a circuitous route making detection a lot easier or risk an artillery strike . history has shown that until you are on top of your enemy and can select your target you are vulnerable to counter measures ( [[ORG]] ) .
if it flies it dies . motto of [[ORG]] .
this strikes me as filling the gap between a wire - guided rocket and a cruise missile . a bit more range and flexibility than a wire guided rocket and considerably less cost than a missile . as if any [[ORG]] had a ' secret weapon ' for very long . winners in warfare are those with the best ground troops and the greatest industrial ability .
good . lets test it out on the border .
you can bet that some of those [[NORP]] are already selling them to terrorists . our failure to destroy the pipeline of weapons to them is what keeps them going . suppliers should be treated just like combat enemies .
[[PERSON]] ... looks like soapboxjesus had to run ... away ...
they better make them cheap or they wo n't sell .
a modern [[PRODUCT]] .....
[[GPE]] will be thrilled -- probably buy a few crates of them and try to reverse engineer them ?
so its a slow , guided missile .. not sure i understand how it 's " revolutionary " .
is there anyone out there that thinks the [[GPE]] military does not have this already ?
we only have guided missiles
new arms race developing , major money for defense industry .
this wo nt make a dent in a modern battle field war , but in the hands of a terrorist it 's a game changer .
would be nice if the [[GPE]] could have [[CARDINAL]] unique weapon .
[[ORG]] already has these ? lol !
[[QUANTITY]] indeed . a round from a .38 pistol well placed would down that thing . no threat whatsoever .
this is no weapon , it 's a toy .
you could load [[CARDINAL]] of them in the back of a pick - up truck and cause a lot of chaos . kind of like a sniper - no one would know where they 're coming from . more accurate than mortars , a [[ORG]] more quiet . warhead pretty small though . would tear up a vehicle convoy or troops in the open . but there are plenty of other weapons already out there that do that better . not sure how useful this will be .
and this is why we are fielding laser anti - drone weapons !
what a giant leap forward in military tech for the [[NORP]] . radio controlled airplanes . smh
nothing good ever comes out of [[GPE]] except more military hardware .
if they really want to cash in on this market , offer a civilian - friendly product reduced in size . heh , heh , reduced size with no explosive but an empty compartment for the do - it - yourselfer . i can think of a couple applications offhand ...
i guess we can call all of our smart bombs ' suicide ' bombs since they are only used once .
stick a few feathers on it and pelosi will want it for a new ride .
already out of date . however so is dynamite but it 's still effective in the right conditions .
wow , how revolutionary !
a toy drone , i am impressed
our guys had better be working on that laser tech just as fast & hard as possible !
technology they and the [[NORP]] no doubt stole from us . hopefully , we also know how to knock them down ...... which no doubt the bad guys also stole from us .
wile e coyote did n't need a big company to strap a stick of [[ORG]] on a rc plane ... this idea has been around since [[DATE]] [[TIME]] cartoons , and was easy enough for a child to do [[DATE]] ( assuming he had a stick of [[ORG]] or an [[PRODUCT]] :)
for every new weapon there is a new counter weapon .
if drones were outlawed only outlaws would have drones ! so now we 're going to need to get a background check and a license to own a drone ... because , " look what a drone can do to a school ! " and " it 's about the children ! " ... they 'll say no one needs a drone .
wonder if that drone 's logic is powered by leftover vacuum tubes ?
obsolete and a total waste of funding while we are at it why not go back to lining our troops up in formation and take turns shooting at each other .
nothing new here . a guided missile is a drone . we have them too .
my personal drone has [[TIME]] flight time and [[QUANTITY]] range . when on vacation i often control this baby from [[QUANTITY]] away .
a [[PERSON]] could easily take that thing out . no worries
how many barrels of vodka does that cost ?
high tech version of the v-2
any drone can do more damage than that one by taking a photo of enemy troop positions .
i read the guys quotes in a [[NORP]] accent , but all i could think of was the voice from [[ORG]] .
i do n't see this as an effective weapon . i betcha [[PERSON]] comes out with a " civilian version " and it never becomes a weapon of war .
if this thing will carry even a 1 megaton nuke , then you 've got something there ..............
highly effective against those who ca n't run .
great , now [[NORP]] have another way to die .
think i saw one fly over my house [[DATE]] , slapped it away with fly swatter
a [[NORP]] version of the [[GPE]] made [[LOC]] ....
...... so guided munitions do n't count ? lol .... not new . flying car bombs are not new .
another reason to just [[PERSON]] the enemy .
the [[NORP]] have to celebrate whatever success they can since they are [[DATE]] behind .
ca n't any junior high student build one of these for [[MONEY]] ?
what i have noticed since [[GPE]] has been building up military [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] have been coming out with some of there new toys . if [[GPE]] never mentioned anything both countries would be saying nothing . this is i do know . that socialist and [[NORP]] are paranoid of themselves and and other people because they feel that someone is doing something behind there back . [[PERSON]] is like that . the same goes for [[GPE]] . these [[CARDINAL]] countries are so paranoid of [[GPE]] that they will do anything to see that they have the upper hand . if push were to come to shove [[GPE]] would bring out " some of it 's new toys " that no one has seen or heard of . the [[NORP]] have a reputation for building things that do n't work too well . the [[ORG]] is the best gun the [[NORP]] ever invented . never count [[GPE]] out .
should n't there be a little bandana on the front of it ?
this thing may be slow , but i suspect it will know you are around and can eliminate you way before you know that it exists .
all the more reason for [[GPE]] to disarm itself .. right libs ?
problem , , , [[PERSON]] die in [[CARDINAL]] hr , , then we do n't have to waste bullets shooting it down . 130kph is pretty dayum slow , , that s target practice for troops on the ground
[[TIME]] flight time .. we need a nuke - powered drone . something that can cruise forever , any weather , day or [[TIME]] ..
another tool to export to the [[ORG]] and other terrorist groups ... all about the [[MONEY]] .
you need to have a working satellite network in order to effectively use drones . if a war broke out between the [[GPE]] and any world power , the [[GPE]] has the ability to eliminate their satellites and thus , control the skies before any conventional weapons are launched .
they did n't mention our drone submarines , that can find and tail a [[NORP]] submarine for [[DATE]] . and given the instructions can sink the [[NORP]] sub and return home .
" ... flies up to [[TIME]] at the speed of 130 kilometers ( [[QUANTITY]] ) per hour . " < --- that means it 's empty ... no payload .
what war did the ak47 win ? was n't wwii . with out [[NORP]] money and arms and blood [[GPE]] would be speaking [[NORP]] .
[[GPE]] will probably buy a bunch with the money obama gave them
outdated ineffective technology .
[[ORG]] , they made something just like the [[PRODUCT]] , so innovative .
missiles already do the same thing .
if they can jam a radar signal they sure as heck can jam a cheap radio controlled toy , all they have to do flip a switch and these things will fall out of the sky onto the people who launched them .
yawn . the huns called it the [[PRODUCT]] .
it seems we are receiving weekly updates on the ordinances countries can use to destroy us . it 's times like this that i realize that , in addition to being the worst president in history , urkel will be remembered for dismantling " missile shield . " we would have been able to protect against all of the countries he ' enabled . '
it will jam just like the ak47 and fall out of the sky killing its operators . [[NORP]] high tech at work here .
you know who is n't bothered by stuff like this ? [[PERSON]] warriors .
a mini laser defense system should be able to take care of those and quite inexpensively .
how is this different from a cruise missile , except being a lot slower .
remember when [[PERSON]] gave our stealth drone tech to [[GPE]] . good stuff .
nothing new about this weapon at all . kudos to the company ‚Äôs pr firm !
[[ORG]]
a slow cruise missile by any other name .
at [[QUANTITY]] , it ca n't be too hard to shoot down .
like most things [[PERSON]] makes , i 'll bet it 's very cheap to build , they can and will make literally [[CARDINAL]] of these things , and they will always work . in other words , they can overwhelm a army with much more sophisticated weapons by sending [[CARDINAL]] of these in , and our response is we have [[MONEY]] cruse missles that we do n't have enough of because they cost too much to use ! again , time to wake up [[GPE]] , we need cheap , and i mean cheap , not [[MONEY]] a shot , but [[MONEY]] a shot , weapons like this , or our enemies , and they are many , will simply overwhelm out forces leaving our defenders helpless .
with a maximum range of what , [[QUANTITY]] , this would seem more useful to terrorists .
and here in [[GPE]] ... we have [[ORG]] employees demanding the corporation pulls the high technology contract from the government or they 'll quit . i dunno ... [[PERSON]] thinking the [[CARDINAL]] people that signed the demand letter should have a meeting called ... and then let 's try one of [[ORG]] miniature exploding drones to see if it really works .
there will be countermeasures like ai coordinated swarms that will be able to detect and intercept .
just a target in the sky
remote controlled or gps guided radio signal can all be jammed and caused to crash . .
[[GPE]] is also stealing cannon technology from [[ORG]] monuments scattered across the [[GPE]] .
if you have ever played bf4 this is not a new concept
we definitely need better way to kill more people ..
single use aircraft because they do n't have the tech to drop anything , or fly it for [[DATE]]
leave it to [[PERSON]] to come up with their own version of the [[ORG]] buzz bomb . the only difference is that this one can be controlled in flight . cheap to make , portable and can be flown by someone with minimal experience . pucker factor of a [[CARDINAL]] near a battlefield .
meanwhile we continue building fancy troop landing craft and tanks .
in developed countries , we call this unit a missile .
to slow to be a major threat . you can down it simple ad wapons .
[[QUANTITY]] wide is not going to tear up a whole lot of stuff , not in warfare standards .
[[GPE]] had full size [[PRODUCT]] 's that were remote controlled in [[DATE]] .
our lasers , [[CARDINAL]] 's , any other weapons we have will take it out , could be a deterrence , but from what ?
this is why we need " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " . this is the future . even our best fighter squadrons could n't destroy 1000 's of these launched at [[CARDINAL]] time . picture this , , , a satellite high above directing [[CARDINAL]] of land to air missiles with a push of a button .
why " kamikaze " ? because they ca n't build one to fly long enough to return and re - arm ? lol . we have been doing this way longer then them .
that 's going to revolutionize deer hunting .
the next big thing is gon na be satellite destruction to upset the balance of power grids and many other things . the end is near
how is this any different than your basic guided missile from a plane or a drone with a hellfire ?
the left will go bonkers . not at the weaponry , but at the cultural appropriation of " [[ORG]] " .
maybe it does all the claimed things but remember the [[NORP]] tend to overglorify their accomplishments remember how " great " things were in [[GPE]] ?
why would they need a [[NORP]] drone if they can build one that deploys weapons and then returns so it can be reused ?
then we get an [[NORP]] drone " drone . then comes the anti-"anti kamakaze drone " . but it 's all good . let the drones battle it out in the sky .
we should go public with our stealth drone that carries a tactical nuke .
... and , if it has n't been done already , another company is developing inexpensive technology to counter such a weapon . it 's been the way of warfare for millennia .
gon na need a higher wall
it ‚Äôs only good for a distance of [[QUANTITY]] ? must have to be launched from an aircraft . seems kind of large for that though , creating drag requiring restricted airspeed for the carrier .
we 've had them for a while . they 're called guided missiles .
[[ORG]] , keep looking over your shoulder !
[[PRODUCT]] ?
funny . i told you all over [[DATE]] such small drones would end the [[NORP]] artillery threat to sk .
saber rattling is all [[PERSON]] seems capable of the country is on the edge of collapse economically seems to only understand threats and war i feel for the [[NORP]] citizens that have had [[DATE]] of this .
also referred to as a " missle " .
so how is this greater than or equal to any precision munition now being fielded , like a [[PRODUCT]] missile ?
the [[NORP]] can not manufacture a toaster oven but spend [[CARDINAL]] on a new weapon system they do not need .
i have to believe that these drones could be easily shot out of the sky by any of our warplanes .
it 's a cruise airplane .
is n't this called a guided missile ? this is old tech . that fact that it is shaped like a drone does n't change it 's functionality .
looks like a poor man 's version of cruise missile
one . the word " democratizing " is really overused and sort of ironic to be used on a missile . [[ORDINAL]] . this is just a slow missile . nothing new .
basically a missile that flies [[QUANTITY]] .
bargain basement cruise missiles for poor nations or terrorists , nothing more .
[[QUANTITY]] and hour,,,could knock that out of the sky with sling shot .hahahaha , not [[CARDINAL]] [[PRODUCT]] lazer shot and its toast
jesus saves ... humans blow things up ...
we need to make a better one . and an anti version .
i guess [[PERSON]] just copied other people ideas still ... [[PERSON]] like how the ak47 is really just the [[NORP]] mp44 that was captured in [[GPE]] .
yeah ? ? so what . we call them [[PERSON]] missles . if we wanted suicide drones we could have been flying predators into crap along time ago . this is nt news its [[GPE]]
any drone can be kamikaze .
this is not even a remotely new idea ...
this is not a new idea .
world peace anyone ?
