I'm surprised Romania or Hungary didn't pick it up on radar which is another problem if they don't have the capacity to identify and destroy incoming armed drone strikes. All these events are reflective of the set patterns and precursors prior to WWII. Historically regime changes, military coups and newly formed dictatorships occur during episodes of chaos when the political stewards and general populous are in a state of panic and disarray. The world is overly armed for conflict and tensions are running very high along with speculation that China, Iran, NoKo and others may enter the fray and exacerbate this situation. We can only hope that Putin fizzles out or concedes to global demands that he cease a desist and remove his troops from Ukraine.",

That is payback from Russia with love.  This drone (TU-141) likely originated out of Belarus and flew directly to Zagreb, Croatia.  This was not pilot error... blah, blah, blah.  This was intentional.  Putin wants to get the NATO involved in this war to justify moving on the Baltic states and possibly Poland and maybe even Romania.  What we need is a no fly zone over Ukraine immediately and if we use our A-10s to take out 50% of Russia's armor columns, we will force his withdrawal. Not 100%, just enough to make him combat ineffective.  There's no logic in the escalation theory. Either we hit Putin's forces in Ukraine now, or do it later in Poland.  The nuclear option is not on the table and that is Putin's major bluff.  He will likely use chemical munitions (VX nerve agent or blister agent), but understand, anyone connected to this will never freely travel throughout the world and will be eventually brought to justice.  The other unknown here is what will be China's level of support.   I don't think Xi Jinping will provide armor support, maybe some bullets or artillery.  Xi Jinping is saving the preponderance of his war stocks for Taiwan.",

It was a Soviet-era TU-141 drone, which weighs about six tons and is launched from a catapult carrier.   It lands using parachutes.  The deployed parachute was found near the crash site.   \n\nEuropean news channels have reported that for over 20 years the only country in the world that operates TU-141 drones is Ukraine.   Even at the end of the USSR 33 years ago, there were no TU-141 drones deployed within the Russia SSR because the border of the USSR  was hundreds of miles to the West.   Drones and other active military elements were deployed where the military action was expected to be, in Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics, which were on the border with the West.    Russia over 25 years ago moved to much newer drones than obsolete TU-141s.\n\nAlmost all of Kiev's air force, including the two or three dozen drones they bought from Turkey, was wiped out in the opening 15 minutes of the war by precision strikes from Russia.  All evidence indicates this drone was pulled from inactive storage by Kiev's forces, fueled, and launched, with the Soviet era guidance system failing and sending it out of Ukraine to the West.  \n\nIt's a classic example of Kiev not giving a hoot about targeting, just the same way they launch artillery strikes at Donbass into civilian areas, because those are easy to hit, unlike trying precision strikes on military targets.",

The UAV's impact to the ground knocked one man off his bicycle and damaged 40 cars parked nearby.[9] It also woke up and upset the student population in the dormitory.[10]‚Äù",
