So if the democrats are allowed to continue down this road of perdition our nation will become a nation of lawlessness and chaos. Perdition \n(in Christian theology) a state of eternal punishment and damnation into which a sinful and unpenitent person passes after death. Time is short and is on a slippery slope of destruction. So yes words matter and when they are used to change a persons view or belief we will no longer be free to our express our opinions but our freedom of religion and freedom of speech will be at stake.
