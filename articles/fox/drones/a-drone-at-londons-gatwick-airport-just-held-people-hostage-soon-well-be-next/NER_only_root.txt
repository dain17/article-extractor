i 'm not sure the [[GPE]] would have the sense to shut down an airport - more likely a drone will bring down a plane full of passengers before the [[GPE]] takes action . it 's the famous [[NORP]] saying " do something so it wo n't happen again" .... when there is a tragedy that should not have happened once .
the high school kids here have state tournaments where robots battle robots . you mean to say that the military can not develop counter - drone drones . mind - boggling .
better solution would be to prohibit manufacturers from producing the damn drones , and marketing them to the general public . when there 's money to be made , profits rule over saving lives , a key problem with a lot of products in the market that are misused for nefarious purposes .
[[NORP]]
some of those high flying drones cost [[MONEY]] . blow a few out of the sky with modern technology , and the punks will stop .
if [[CARDINAL]] hovers near my property , [[GPE]] blow it out of the sky . get you [[ORG]] packages another way . period .
shoot it out of the sky . that is a [[CARDINAL]] size fits all solution ,
" hey , man . i was trying to get some cool [[TIME]] videos of planes taking off . but every time i sent my camera drone over the runways , the air traffic all stopped . what 's up with that ? huh ? "
i shot one down with a sling shot hovering over my property .......
its called a gun , just like shooting clay pigeons .
a few security guards with [[CARDINAL]] - guages out to do the trick . personally , i ca n't wait until a drone flies over my property .
technical radar cross section advancement . imaging on narrow and wide beam bands sweeping from numerous directions simultaneously . discreet enough that organic intervention triggering a response differentiates between birds and drones . if a drone enters the perimeter an immediate response from the upper and lower house in [[GPE]] will form a committee to look into the matter before [[DATE]] .
is this the same [[FAC]] that just a short time ago an islamic terrorist ( suicide bomber ) and his [[PERSON]] blew up . killing innocent civilians ? we do not need this coming to our country .. build the wall ! fix our out dated immigration laws .. tell the [[NORP]] they will have to look some where else to get new voters ...
well ... whack it and move on . what is the problem ?
there should be a shut off access to the radio control in all drones . then law enforcement can interrupt the signal and drop them to the ground or take over control . this will have to happen .
a laser in the tower could have taken down the intruder . why not take the drone down and leave the airport open .
the people flying the drone are probably the same ones selling the drone countermeasure equipment .
get [[CARDINAL]] of those [[ORG]] seal sharpshooter to blow it out of the sky . the financial loss just might keep this clown from trying it again . if not , get another military sharpshooter to blow it to smithereens .
is there really that much difference between a drone and a clay practice target ? “ pull ! ”
i 've been reading a lot of posts here about how to deal with the problem , from jammers to shotguns to nets to fines and prison . i do n't think a lot of that would work for many reasons , but i have a sure - fire way to fix this problem . every time a drone interferes with commerce or aviation safety or even someone 's sleep , just toss a small , tactical nuke into the area . the emp from that will permanently ground any drones in the area . perfect solution . i 'm sorry . my sarcasm switch seems to be stuck in the [[ORG]] position [[DATE]] .
we have the right to bear killer drones with arms as a part of a well rounded militia as prescribed in the [[ORDINAL]] ammendament ! mega !
[[PERSON]] seems to be perfectly happy shutting down even at unsupported reports of drones . apparently no other solution appeals to them
there are a core of hard core sociopaths that are applauding this action . the same type of person that derives glee from crashing a website or infecting computer systems ' for fun ' .
i give up , i read the story , watched the video , but did n't read or see how they stopped the drone or if the pilot just quit flying it . biggest question , why not just shoot it down , would take [[TIME]] , [[PERSON]] . they spent [[TIME]] doing what ?
a helicopter with jamming equipment ( to disable the drone ) and radio tracker ( to find the controller ) would seem to be in order . and the perp , when caught , should be put in the stocks and placed where the inconvenienced travellers can reach him . [[PERSON]] eggs , mushy tomatoes , wilted lettuce heads can be provided by the on - site restaurants .
killer drone , it would assume the identity of the trespassing drone and when it returns to its home , boom !
let me guess .. your company sells the exact products to address the " problem "
the [[NORP]] response was oddly lackidaisical to say the least . almost like they preferred shutting down the airport to more proactive solutions .
i believe i read another article awhile back that discussed specific hunting birds being trained to take out unwanted drones out of the sky over secure areas . maybe this is an idea .
i think this article screams more " i need a proofreader ! " than " let 's do something about these drones ! "
so , why did n't they shoot it down ?
man up , [[GPE]] .
the [[NORP]] do n't seem to be taking the problem seriously .
beware of all types of drones . maybe the most dangerous types are those that drone on and on in our government and the media . they speak persistently in a dull , monotonous tone and spend years in dull or monotonous activity or in idleness droning their terms away .
only because the brits were too cowardly to shoot them down . spineless , neutered [[NORP]] .
they should have despatched an [[ORG]] fighter aircraft to shoot down the drone . there likely were [[CARDINAL]] of aggravated holiday travelers who had their holiday plans disrupted . also there needs to be tracking electronics at airports to identify the location of the person who is controlling the drone .
commercial multicopter " drones " -- quadcopters , octacopters , etc -- all have a very limited flight time . [[TIME]] on average . why has n't [[PERSON]] simply placed lookouts on rooftops with binoculars to follow these things back to where they land ?
start shooting them down . could also use combat drones to disable and trace .
i believe [[PERSON]] warned about drones , not as if it would have changed anything . actually i 'm surprised someone did n't think of drone technology long before now with the rc industry we have had for so long .
just shoot them down . what is the problem ?
any duck hunter worth his salt and a 12 gauge shotgun would solve the problem for a lot less money .
time to deploy the [[ORG]] 's new anti drone lazer tech to airports
we need to start by licensing drones and their operators like we do for private aircraft and their pilots . every drone ( just like all aircraft ) should be required to have a transponder so it shows up on radar . finally , we need to have severe criminal penalties for anyone caught violating these rules . still , one has to wonder at all these expensive high - tech solutions for the problem when a [[QUANTITY]] shotgun loaded with the right type of shot would take care of the problem in short order ! ! !
how long will it take the [[NORP]] to figure out that they can just shoot it down ?
i 'm sure this is something that taxes and permits will take care of . that is how our protectors usually react with . perhaps creating a new , massive , federal agency for drones ? it wo n't accomplish anything but it will make the federal government larger .
fear monger much ? yikes
nothing like a mandatory [[CARDINAL]] yr federal prison sentence though . and in the wrong ethnic wing of the prison .
ohhhhh ... that was a drone ! i thought it was [[GPE]] 's voice .
back in [[DATE]] , [[CARDINAL]] teenagers with a pressure cooker shut down a large portion of [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] . shutting down an airport for [[DATE]] with a drone is pretty lame compared to that .
pretty simple , just station the national guard at airports with orders to shoot down any drone that comes in and then trace the location & arrest the drone pilot
this author just droned on and on .
even better , the advent of personal transportation using drone stabilizing technologies will eliminate the need for airports and airlines all together . we 'll be harder to terrorize or hold hostage when we all have autonomous and self directed flight capability , moving away from the military type control paradigm aviation currently labors under
" mr. [[PERSON]] , meet mr. [[PERSON]] ... "
[[DATE]] would take care of that pronto . oh , and i find it hard to believe that this was able to go on for [[DATE]] and they could n't stop it .
