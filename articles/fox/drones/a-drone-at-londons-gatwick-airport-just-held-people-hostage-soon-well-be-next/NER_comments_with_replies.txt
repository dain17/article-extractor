i 'm not sure the [[GPE]] would have the sense to shut down an airport - more likely a drone will bring down a plane full of passengers before the [[GPE]] takes action . it 's the famous [[NORP]] saying " do something so it wo n't happen again" .... when there is a tragedy that should not have happened once .
the high school kids here have state tournaments where robots battle robots . you mean to say that the military can not develop counter - drone drones . mind - boggling .
better solution would be to prohibit manufacturers from producing the damn drones , and marketing them to the general public . when there 's money to be made , profits rule over saving lives , a key problem with a lot of products in the market that are misused for nefarious purposes .
[[NORP]]
some of those high flying drones cost [[MONEY]] . blow a few out of the sky with modern technology , and the punks will stop .
if [[CARDINAL]] hovers near my property , [[GPE]] blow it out of the sky . get you [[ORG]] packages another way . period .
shoot it out of the sky . that is a [[CARDINAL]] size fits all solution ,
jamming works too . the frequencies needed to control one of those things are pretty easy to jam . once jammed , it will crash , and can be recovered as evidence . if i could jam sophisticated [[NORP]] systems [[DATE]] , i 'm sure we can do it better [[DATE]] . also , is anyone looking to see if this is part of a [[NORP]] or [[NORP]] operation ?
" hey , man . i was trying to get some cool [[TIME]] videos of planes taking off . but every time i sent my camera drone over the runways , the air traffic all stopped . what 's up with that ? huh ? "
i shot one down with a sling shot hovering over my property .......
its called a gun , just like shooting clay pigeons .
i suddenly had one of my weird visions about the [[NORP]] and their very proper ways of doing things , and i was over run by the sight of [[CARDINAL]] of workers at [[GPE]] 's airports running around with butterfly nets . never the one to disturb the peace , eh [[ORG]] ?
that 's right . a shotgun loaded with [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] shot oughta do it .
with a [[QUANTITY]] capability . not really .
poor londoners too bad they do not allow guns .
a few security guards with [[CARDINAL]] - guages out to do the trick . personally , i ca n't wait until a drone flies over my property .
sadly they are protected under [[ORG]]
these drones were flying [[CARDINAL]] or thee hundred feet above ground and moving evasively . even a championship skeet shooter probably could n't do it . and they did have security with shotguns .
exactly , with a shotguns effective range at [[QUANTITY]] , a drone at [[QUANTITY]] is safe from that .
technical radar cross section advancement . imaging on narrow and wide beam bands sweeping from numerous directions simultaneously . discreet enough that organic intervention triggering a response differentiates between birds and drones . if a drone enters the perimeter an immediate response from the upper and lower house in [[GPE]] will form a committee to look into the matter before [[DATE]] .
is this the same [[FAC]] that just a short time ago an islamic terrorist ( suicide bomber ) and his [[PERSON]] blew up . killing innocent civilians ? we do not need this coming to our country .. build the wall ! fix our out dated immigration laws .. tell the [[NORP]] they will have to look some where else to get new voters ...
walls wo n't keep out drones . it 's too early to be drinking .
well ... whack it and move on . what is the problem ?
the article is talking about if it comes to the [[GPE]] .
if it comes to the [[GPE]] , no problem ... just issue some drone - approved shotgun shells to the officers near the airport .
it 's the [[GPE]] , so what are they going to whack it with ? a cricket bat ? :)
there should be a shut off access to the radio control in all drones . then law enforcement can interrupt the signal and drop them to the ground or take over control . this will have to happen .
no matter what they do some smart [[ORDINAL]] old will be able to figure out how to undo
well , with all the electric gimmicks being added to cars ( keyless ignition and such ) , i would not be surprised if that did n't already exist ( or will soon be added ) in cars . the thing with the drones though is that there are people who build their own drones , so any commercial backdoors like that would not apply .
would n't be all that difficult to modify .
a laser in the tower could have taken down the intruder . why not take the drone down and leave the airport open .
the people flying the drone are probably the same ones selling the drone countermeasure equipment .
get [[CARDINAL]] of those [[ORG]] seal sharpshooter to blow it out of the sky . the financial loss just might keep this clown from trying it again . if not , get another military sharpshooter to blow it to smithereens .
do you realize how difficult it is to hit a moving airborne target with a rifle ? do you realize that if the shooter misses when he is firing in the air , the bullet will still be traveling at a lethal velocity when it does come to ground ? do you realize that major airports in the [[GPE]] are in well - populated areas ? any round that could leave the confines of the airport property would be unacceptable .
this is why you should use a shotgun .
it 's a residential area , firing into the sky with anything other than maybe buckshot is out of the question .
how about a shoulder mounted missile launcher ?
a sniper with a radio - signal - detection scope ( instead of heat vision ) on his rifle . track down the root of the problem , not the toy he is playing with .
is there really that much difference between a drone and a clay practice target ? “ pull ! ”
i 've been reading a lot of posts here about how to deal with the problem , from jammers to shotguns to nets to fines and prison . i do n't think a lot of that would work for many reasons , but i have a sure - fire way to fix this problem . every time a drone interferes with commerce or aviation safety or even someone 's sleep , just toss a small , tactical nuke into the area . the emp from that will permanently ground any drones in the area . perfect solution . i 'm sorry . my sarcasm switch seems to be stuck in the [[ORG]] position [[DATE]] .
we have the right to bear killer drones with arms as a part of a well rounded militia as prescribed in the [[ORDINAL]] ammendament ! mega !
[[PERSON]] seems to be perfectly happy shutting down even at unsupported reports of drones . apparently no other solution appeals to them
there are a core of hard core sociopaths that are applauding this action . the same type of person that derives glee from crashing a website or infecting computer systems ' for fun ' .
i give up , i read the story , watched the video , but did n't read or see how they stopped the drone or if the pilot just quit flying it . biggest question , why not just shoot it down , would take [[TIME]] , [[PERSON]] . they spent [[TIME]] doing what ?
a helicopter with jamming equipment ( to disable the drone ) and radio tracker ( to find the controller ) would seem to be in order . and the perp , when caught , should be put in the stocks and placed where the inconvenienced travellers can reach him . [[PERSON]] eggs , mushy tomatoes , wilted lettuce heads can be provided by the on - site restaurants .
killer drone , it would assume the identity of the trespassing drone and when it returns to its home , boom !
let me guess .. your company sells the exact products to address the " problem "
and it is a problem . it is people like you who bury there head in the sand that keep us in business .
the [[NORP]] response was oddly lackidaisical to say the least . almost like they preferred shutting down the airport to more proactive solutions .
i believe i read another article awhile back that discussed specific hunting birds being trained to take out unwanted drones out of the sky over secure areas . maybe this is an idea .
i love this ... thx u !
i think this article screams more " i need a proofreader ! " than " let 's do something about these drones ! "
and thank you for being the grammar police . now , how about addressing the content ?
so , why did n't they shoot it down ?
what other weapon would you use in a residential area to shoot at a small flying object [[QUANTITY]] away ?
[[QUANTITY]] ? no such shotgun .
that should have been [[QUANTITY]] .
not many cops would be certified on long barrel shotguns . imagine if it was a weapon he was n't certified on , his personal weapon ( not department issue ) , and shooting at an object not within police use of weapons protocols , and not an immediate threat to life . it would not be approved , certainly on the spur of the moment .
umm ... how about approved law enforcement types of people ? the ones with certification , weapons and the training to use them ? who the heck said anything about civilians ? they ( law enforcement ) are in airports and handle issues all the time .
airport security are n't equipped with hunting shotguns , or the training and protocols to use them .
hunting shotguns ? who said anything about hunting shotguns ?
they could call someone in who is , right ?
you ca n't just let civilians into a secure airport compound to shoot at things . there are security concerns , safety protocols , laws against civilian weapons use in residential and public spaces , insurance concerns , etc .
man up , [[GPE]] .
too late ....
the [[NORP]] do n't seem to be taking the problem seriously .
neither are we .
beware of all types of drones . maybe the most dangerous types are those that drone on and on in our government and the media . they speak persistently in a dull , monotonous tone and spend years in dull or monotonous activity or in idleness droning their terms away .
only because the brits were too cowardly to shoot them down . spineless , neutered [[NORP]] .
they would need guns to do that .... and they 're illegal .
they should have despatched an [[ORG]] fighter aircraft to shoot down the drone . there likely were [[CARDINAL]] of aggravated holiday travelers who had their holiday plans disrupted . also there needs to be tracking electronics at airports to identify the location of the person who is controlling the drone .
[[PERSON]] is a residential area . what could a fighter fire at a drone that would n't end up embedded in someone 's house ?
military drones , which are many times larger than these drones , are extreme difficult for a fighter to shoot down . next to impossible for [[CARDINAL]] to shoot one of these down . you use missiles at an airport with other planes in the air & the missile will be drawn to the larger target . try to use the cannon on aircraft & all those rounds that miss will be hitting something on the ground like other aircraft , homes , cars , people , etc . depending on how it 's flying , a shotgun from the ground would be a feasible option but not a guarantee . they have technology that can do things , as the article stated , but it requires investing in & making that technology available at the airport .
commercial multicopter " drones " -- quadcopters , octacopters , etc -- all have a very limited flight time . [[TIME]] on average . why has n't [[PERSON]] simply placed lookouts on rooftops with binoculars to follow these things back to where they land ?
they probably did . reports say they have a " person of interest " .
start shooting them down . could also use combat drones to disable and trace .
ducklk4 - agreed . maybe 00 buck in [[DATE]] " mag - but still would need to be a heckuva lot closer . ducklk4 -
i believe [[PERSON]] warned about drones , not as if it would have changed anything . actually i 'm surprised someone did n't think of drone technology long before now with the rc industry we have had for so long .
just shoot them down . what is the problem ?
you ca n't use rifles , it 's in a residential area ; and airport security were n't equipped with hunting shotguns , and the training and protocols for using them on and around airport property . it 's not like they could have just put out a call for a bunch of hunters to show up and let them loose on airport grounds . that would require security checks , residential gun use exemptions , and would be an insurance nightmare .
god knows .
any duck hunter worth his salt and a 12 gauge shotgun would solve the problem for a lot less money .
i know some pretty good dove hunters too - like me !
you got that right ! !
time to deploy the [[ORG]] 's new anti drone lazer tech to airports
or a duck hunting gun
we need to start by licensing drones and their operators like we do for private aircraft and their pilots . every drone ( just like all aircraft ) should be required to have a transponder so it shows up on radar . finally , we need to have severe criminal penalties for anyone caught violating these rules . still , one has to wonder at all these expensive high - tech solutions for the problem when a [[QUANTITY]] shotgun loaded with the right type of shot would take care of the problem in short order ! ! !
it 's already in the works . the [[ORG]] is working with manufacturers now to find a low - cost , low - power and lightweight transponder solution
while the shotgun idea certainly occurred to the authorities , from the videos it looks like it occurred to the drone operators too , they were zipping around in evasive maneuvers and staying at altitudes that would make them difficult targets .
i understand that the reluctance to use snipers was due to concerns over stray shots and not inability to hit the target . if the drone(s ) were evading , they must be under direct control - which means their control signals can be traced and jammed . they would also likely be within visual range of their controllers .
true , but as usual with the case of some new threat , they did n't take the need for drone tracking and neutralizing seriously until such an incident occurred that caused real disruption and operational losses to someone .
how long will it take the [[NORP]] to figure out that they can just shoot it down ?
i understand the problem completely and never suggested a rifle was an appropriate weapon in this situation . i was just responding to the guy who still believes the myth that [[NORP]] cops have no guns .
i take it you 've never been to [[GPE]] airports . they were patrolling them with mp5s back when [[NORP]] cops were still using [[ORG]]
they do n't have gun lying around . maybe they can throw knives at them ?
i 'm sure this is something that taxes and permits will take care of . that is how our protectors usually react with . perhaps creating a new , massive , federal agency for drones ? it wo n't accomplish anything but it will make the federal government larger .
fear monger much ? yikes
i 'm guessing you were n't at the airport . if you 're not affected , it did n't happen , right ?
i was n't at [[EVENT]] , so i guess that did n't happen either ?
mom wisely does n't let him out of her basement .
and yet the airport was shut down . fear ? no . as someone who has a masters in cyber security , specializing in drones , i can assure you that it is not fear mongering . do research before posting next time .
nothing like a mandatory [[CARDINAL]] yr federal prison sentence though . and in the wrong ethnic wing of the prison .
" prisoner 382267 , you are now known as [[PERSON]] . "
ohhhhh ... that was a drone ! i thought it was [[GPE]] 's voice .
back in [[DATE]] , [[CARDINAL]] teenagers with a pressure cooker shut down a large portion of [[GPE]] for [[DATE]] . shutting down an airport for [[DATE]] with a drone is pretty lame compared to that .
pretty simple , just station the national guard at airports with orders to shoot down any drone that comes in and then trace the location & arrest the drone pilot
this author just droned on and on .
even better , the advent of personal transportation using drone stabilizing technologies will eliminate the need for airports and airlines all together . we 'll be harder to terrorize or hold hostage when we all have autonomous and self directed flight capability , moving away from the military type control paradigm aviation currently labors under
how tall of a wall are we going to need once there is a cheap [[CARDINAL]] - seater drone on the market ?
no wall needed -- deploy a bunch of pick up trucks with bed mounted " rocket powered catch nets " . the nets will take down every drone at far less cost than walls and anti - aircraft batteries .
" mr. [[PERSON]] , meet mr. [[PERSON]] ... "
drone should have simply been shot down within [[TIME]] by some marks - man . simple what 's the issue ? ? ? ?
if it is moving , it 's not that easy of a shot with a rifle . since you said " marksman " , then it implies a rifle , not a shotgun . there 's also the issue of any bullets that miss the drone eventually landing in a populate area and injuring someone . you do n't shoot skeet with a rifle . a shotgun would be acceptable since the smaller pellets lose velocity from wind resistance quicker and it would be less of a danger to nearby people . of course , we 're talking the [[GPE]] here , so they would have probably had to search for [[TIME]] before they could have found someone with a shotgun that they could use . where i 'm at , they would just go to the check - in area and ask if anyone had a shotgun and some ammo they could borrow . surely * someone * would be taking a hunting trip and carry a shotgun along with them . usually though , i only see people with handguns and rifles checking them in with their luggage .
[[DATE]] would take care of that pronto . oh , and i find it hard to believe that this was able to go on for [[DATE]] and they could n't stop it .
you read my mind !
