Only Congress can inact laws.  Also, if the drones are not registered - which is still not a criminal offense - then the serial number is largely useless.   Also, some commercial and military drones do have a 6' wingspan.  No idea what or why the drone activity - but flying multiple large drones in close proximity, at night, even with IR or a flight management system requires several skilled drone pilots with more technology than the average recreational drone operator.  However, the same flight management software could auto-fly the drones in grid patterns as described - but that type of flying, for multiple devices is not you average hobbyist.  This could be as simple as commercial or military testing new equipment - or commercial operators performing LiDAR surveying - or (of concern) a rogue group learning to fly and operate in unison.  Sheriffs should take this serious.  A drone with a 6' wingspan could carry more than a camera.  Also, this is noticeably close to DIA.  Despite the humor in the comments, the operators should be found.",

Commercial ventures are not so likely since they would have to get flight permission and be very transparent with FAA and other regulators. Plus NO corporate lawyer would green-light night flights like that; the liability would be staggering. And night flying would be fairly worthless to things like mapping and surveys.

There’s several start up drone firms that use these sized drones for medical delivery or Amazon as well. Amazon has been hiring pilots for delivery testing for a while now, unfortunately they don’t pay jack. Intel has a drone this size, I think it’s called a Falcon, that several of these startups use, but most of these start ups are not going to last, this is most likely Amazon. Unfortunately this is also where I think the next terrorist attacks are going to come from, drones!
