take [[CARDINAL]] out of the sky and wait to see who comes looking ....
knock them down when you see one .
the sheriff 's nonchalant attitude makes me think he knows exactly what they are .
get used to it , folks
if the drone flights are with in [[QUANTITY]] of protected site like an airport the [[ORG]] should have a record of those that are licensed to fly the area . if it is the military .. you 'll never find out . but i will say that no one learns from movie .. ie . terminator ...
a squadron of [[QUANTITY]] drones and the military or government does n't know anything . [[PERSON]] right . just like they did n't know anything about area 51 and ufo 's .
a concerned resident could reach out and touch the drones , using a long - barrel goose - gun and [[CARDINAL]] ' " magnum shells loaded with bismuth or tungsten shot .
it maybe the [[NORP]] trying to scout out graveyards and man camps to find more dead and illegal voters for [[DATE]] ... lord knows they 're going to need it .
pretty strange . must be a bunch of dry runs practicing for something bigger . my guess is one of the government entities that has been contacted is doing a great impersonation of [[PERSON]] .
just an odd phenomenon . because drones sometimes just randomly appear in the sky . great police work [[PERSON]] .
drone club at [[ORG]]
guess they are troubled by nocturnally missions .
i ’m a uav pilot and have my own drone biz and i know that a [[QUANTITY]] drone , if that ’s accurate , is very rare . these are not stoners or just some people having fun . my smallest , littlest drone , all in , was [[MONEY]] . drones of this size are almost always used for either agriculture or delivery . there ’s several start up drone firms that use these sized drones for medical delivery or [[ORG]] as well . [[ORG]] has been hiring pilots for delivery testing for a while now , unfortunately they do n’t pay jack . [[ORG]] has a drone this size , i think it ’s called a [[ORG]] , that several of these startups use , but most of these start ups are not going to last , this is most likely [[ORG]] . unfortunately this is also where i think the next terrorist attacks are going to come from , drones ! pretty easy to drop bombs from or drop chemical or biological weapons from ; can you imagine a fleet of them ? ? this is bad and it ’s coming ! [[ORG]] drones are big and have huge canisters underneath for spot fertilizing ; can easily fill with gasoline .
i wonder if the mystery fliers could ever figure out the mystery of which brave citizen took matters into their own hands and dispatched those drones to the nearest junkyard .
pelosi sent them up to search for her sanity and brains .
as an [[ORG]] certified drone pilot , i can tell you that flying at [[TIME]] is illegal , unless you obtain an [[ORG]] waiver ( which takes a lot of paperwork work and [[DATE]] to obtain ) . so the [[ORG]] should at least be concerned and hopefully involved in figuring this out . also , i have a friend with a drone almost that large ...... it cost [[MONEY]] and uses [[CARDINAL]] batteries that are [[MONEY]] each ( he uses it for tv and video production ) . so this is n't some yahoo playing with his [[DATE]] gift ...
" sheriffs have reached out to [[ORG]] ... " [[WORK_OF_ART]] editors ... it 's [[ORG]] .
you could take one down with a shotgun ...
" we have no idea ... but it 's all above board . " what ?
cool , where are all the video clips of the phenomenon ? do they make sound ? are they all the same size ? so many simple questions so few concrete answers .
if you can put it in the air with a remote , law enforcement can bring it down with a [[ORG]] , if they wanted to ( may require warrant ) . do n't think for [[TIME]] that jammers and interceptors do n't exist .
was out raccoon hunting and happened to accidentally hit this drone while i was shooting at the raccoon in the tree .....
get your own drones going and follow them ... see where they go and who is running them ... easy solution to the mystery ...
i love the way he calls them conspiracy theories . they are theories , until proven wrong .
do n't mind all the drones , that 's just [[PERSON]] still searching for impeachment proof .
in the age of digital photography & video . may we all take a look .
[[GPE]]
nothing a [[CARDINAL]] g could n't handle .
if this is [[ORG]] activity at any level , of course they 'll say they know nothing . its the nature of surveillance .
does n't sound like off the shelf toy drones , could be engine driven model aircraft which can fly greater distances providing whoever is controlling them is following along .
i doubt [[CARDINAL]] of drone users register with the [[ORG]] . [[CARDINAL]] ' wingspans , well , we know they 're not cheap . what we do know is a rough average of flight time and they got to land somewhere .
drones should never had been allowed as a public recreational device and business / government agency drones should be required to be registered with flight plans filed . right now there are virtually no controls over who does what with these as far as enforcement because it is almost impossible to determine who is flying them and for what purposes .
bring a few down and see what they carry or who complains .
probably drug cartel delivering drugs . with a [[QUANTITY]] wing span you could carry a lot of weight with one .
a well - trained emotional support eagle or [[ORG]] would be a good solution to this problem ..
these are the mysterious ' red glowing ' lights that people see everywhere .
it is [[NORP]] looking for [[GPE]] .
fun fact : shooting a drone is a felony .
drug dealing drones .
almost every person posting ignoring the fact that shooting at a drone is against [[ORG]] !
it is in fact illegal , if the [[ORG]] does n't know they likely do not have the proper credentials to fly , let alone at [[TIME]] . night requires an additional certification beyond the [[ORG]] 107 , as well as , drones equipped with the proper lighting . so in short , they pose a danger to public and air craft because there is no flight plan filed and no certifications on hand , are the maintaining line of sight ? remaining below [[CARDINAL]] ft [[ORG]] ? do they have an observer ? just saying , yes , they are legal to engage , utilize local laws for discharging a weapon outside city limits , happy hunting .
it 's the [[NORP]] searching for illegals to vote .
obama still selling guns to the drug cartel ?
so , the consensus is that if this is a secret government program being tested . possibly something that would keep our men over seas safe , the govt . should have sent out memos [[ORDINAL]] to all you paranoids and asked permission ?
it is not an ' odd phenomenon " ... and seeings how both military and law enforcement deny it is them , it is time for a group of ' drone hunters ' to get together and drop em all .
they are looking to get nudie shots of people in their homes
a few mini sams will remedy all that .
night flights are interesting . what are they tracking ? are folks aware that one can rig a drone to do many things other than take pics ? i do n't get the lackadaisical attitude of law enforcement before the press unless they have [[ORG]] that is very problematic and do n't wish to cause public panic .
so all the feds and military are telling [[PERSON]] fife that they know nothing about this and none of them seem [[ORG]] ... … ... i ca n't fly my [[CARDINAL]] ft drone unless i register it with the [[ORG]] ... … .. what gives ?
well that is a mystery that is easy to [[PERSON]] them down , and see who comes to complain about it .
i wonder if their drones at all . i 'm sure the witnesses eyes told them they are drones but they could have been witnessing something far more extraordinary .
this is likely government or [[GPE]] military related despite their denial . probably some kind of testing .
[[ORG]] delivery testing .
shoot [[CARDINAL]] down
flash mob of drones or a drone rave !
shoot a few of them down . you ’ll probably find out who owns them pretty quickly .
hard to believe the government , military nor the [[ORG]] have a clue .
" have been trying to determine if any laws are being broken with the nocturnal flights " i 'd wager most jurisdictions have " public nuisance " laws ... ... and given the number of complaints , this would seem to fit .
has anyone created a map of the sightings ?
it is illegal to shoot down or at drones , [[CARDINAL]] u.s.c. § [[DATE]] . the question is , why does this story trigger so many ? [[ORDINAL]] of all you do n't know that it is an accurate story , [[ORDINAL]] of all there are many useful possibilities for drone usage that maybe being tested .
i bet those sheriffs are puzzled by a lot of things .
[[CARDINAL]] ' wing span is not a toy drone . someone is investing big money and highly likely it is not for good reasons .
ummmmm , you are the authorities . shoot one down and find out . these things are probably filled with drugs or money or both .
this is not about being paranoid , and we ca n't afford to be naive . the potential for these things to be weaponized has been proven . and flying dozens at [[TIME]] ? ? that is suspicious , law enforcement is correct and the source should be identified . " before something bad happens "
sentinel
we have reached the point where [[GPE]] is now checking things out
dang . if only these drones needed to land to be recharged . then a person could follow them to their origin .
if the purpose of these drones was above board , someone would have come forward by now .
with a [[CARDINAL]] ft span , not some amateur(s ) . does n't take much to bring [[CARDINAL]] down . flying at [[TIME]] is complicated , requires special sensors and skills .
here is one that went to court ..... while technically illegal to shoot it , seems the courts have mercy in this grey area . " [[PERSON]] in [[DATE]] said he saw a drone flying above his property in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] . he believed it was spying on his [[DATE]] daughter who was sunbathing in the garden . so he took out his shotgun and blasted the drone out of the sky . he was arrested for wanton endangerment and criminal mischief . now a [[GPE]] court has declared [[PERSON]] an innocent man . [[ORG]] judge [[PERSON]] on [[DATE]] dismissed all charges against [[GPE]] , reported local tv station [[ORG]] . "
ca n't someone just follow them with another drone and take pictures of wherever they return to ?
guessing it 's [[ORG]] experimenting with drone delivery . should be fun seeing how they make that final few feet .
terrorist test run .
when [[CARDINAL]] ( some say more ) drones with [[CARDINAL]] ' wingspans fly around together , somebody knows what is going on . for this to be happening for so long and everyone claims " i know nothing " is [[CARDINAL]] of [[CARDINAL]] things . the government knows and will not say or the government agencies are totally incompetent .
it 's trump of course . he wants to know what 's going on over rural [[GPE]] . and maybe catch a little bedroom action ! lol go trump 2020 ..........
there are now drones available on the commercial market which have small onboard computers and are programmable to either be semi - autonomous or autonomous . they can also be programmed to act in concert with other drones .
i would vote running drugs from [[GPE]] to [[GPE]] .
drone ... the sound i hear every time there 's a [[NORP]] debate .
everyone should know it 's [[ORG]] looking for those damned sheep ..
a hidden sniper with a good rifle could solve this . just shoot one down and give what 's left to the [[ORG]] .
i 'd bet good money it 's [[NORP]] nationalists gathering data on agricultural production . there have been numerous stories of [[NORP]] being arrested in the [[LOC]] for trying to steal patented grain samples directly from the fields . they 're trying to figure out how we do things so they do n't have to rely on our farmers as much . they have a long history of stealing intellectual property because they are n't innovative on their own . this is a much bigger story than it appears .
send a helicopter to get a birds eye view .

pull!!! ... pew , pew , pew ! ! !
perhaps they are shooting a sequel to that horrible movie : [[PERSON]] has fallen again and he can not get up .
oh no .... it 's the [[NORP]] voting machines ...
i love watching people wreck their drones .
well , if possible someone with a rifle needs to open fire one at a time and track it from there .
[[DATE]] !
[[PERSON]] , is it [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] plotting their next election interference campaign ?
the reaction from some of you here reminds me of when there was a reading of hg wells " war of the [[PERSON]] " over the radio and people panicked . just because you do n't understand something does n't mean you are under a threat .
sounds like an opportunity to try out that light intensifying scope and a 10 gauge goose gun .
call it a " turkey shoot " ( seriously ) , and take them out . i would .
big brother is always watching you
my guess is it 's google or [[PERSON]] .
mini - ufo aliens .
if you are that curious , shoot one down and find out !
pull !
[[ORG]] practicing [[ORG]]
flak 88 . problem solved .
do like i do . blast them out of the sky if they fly over your property .
just checking over my pot farms .
another thing , these appear to be large commercial type drones according to reports . they are n't carried in the back of an suv . there has to be a of commercial hauler or [[CARDINAL]] parked within [[QUANTITY]] of their activity . this seems fishy , the peeps that area saying " we do n't know anything " are lying .
nothing a [[CARDINAL]] gage shotgun would n’t take care of .
my echo show just converted to an ils approach screen . [[GPE]] is finally here ! ! !
" aliens of the corn" ... … .no problem the corn is all [[ORG]] anyways .
thank god a bunch of kids having fun is front page news ! it means there is nothing important to print i guess ?
if you see something say something ....... may not be breaking any laws now but what happens when these “ harmless ” drones are fitted with weapons , bombs etc ......
i does need to be determined who is operating them . drones with [[QUANTITY]] wingspans are not toys and it is a known fact that they can be weaponized .
the [[ORG]] is looking for potential voters to sign up .
test flights for personal transport drone . they can carry up to [[MONEY]] , its going to be like [[ORG]] , but flying .
what the hell is wrong with this country now . shoot them down . they are invasive and unwelcome . that will flush out the owners .
wow this article has all of the paranoid conspiracy theorists in an uproar .... hilarious . also [[CARDINAL]] could make the argument for gun control based on the fact that many commenters here want to shoot anything they do n't know about or do n't like . just sayin ' ....
" we 're not saying it was [[PERSON]] ..... but it was [[PERSON]] . " [[PERSON]]
was n't this on an episode of [[WORK_OF_ART]] ?
[[ORG]] .
skynet cyberdyne systems .
seems pretty hard to believe that our government does not know who is doing this and/or can not track back where the guidance signal is coming from .
do n't really care as long as they are n't hurting anyone or braking laws !
conspiracy theories will fly ? hmmm , is it too far a stretch to think that technology [[DATE]] could change the warfare landscape , terrorist or otherwise ? hmmm btw , what ever happened to [[GPE]] ? :)
what is [[ORG]] " ?
they 're becoming self aware and are apparently nocturnal ...... cyberdyne anyone ?
why not just leave them alone ?
six foot drones with extended flight time ? that narrows down who could even afford a ' fleet ' of drones like that . my money says it 's [[ORG]] testing a new fleet of drones .
which is it - nestor or [[ORG]] ?
i am amazed at all the people advocating shooting down drones . [[ORDINAL]] , it is a federal offence to shot any aircraft out of the sky , drones included . [[ORDINAL]] , no , you do not " own " the airspace above your property . shoot a drone down , regardless of where it is flying , and you are facing federal charges .
wait for it ..... "trump is responsible for it " ...
soon . police will have drone jammers to disable unauthorized drones
or it could be a test . a test to see if radar can spot them . to see if the populace notices them . to see what authorities do when they see them . it is clear the authorities did nothing so the next step is to see the real reason a group of operators is flying a group of drones instead of individual ones especially at [[TIME]] .
i bet if everyone took their drones out to that area and started flying them around randomly , the [[NORP]] - leece and [[PERSON]] would suddenly show more interest .
the trumpenkriegers practicing their " civil war " against the productive majority .... [[PERSON]]
obviously not real [[PRODUCT]] . we would have one down and figured out by now .
high tech mugger looking for possible victims .
looking for domestic terrorist training camps ?
flying at [[TIME]] , they must be finding something interesting to see through some bedroom windows ... and the [[ORG]] requires registration of drones , as well as restrictions on having to remain within " line of sight " of the operator , which seems like a neat trick to do in the dark , meaning that they must be operating them with [[TIME]] vision systems ... and most farmers i know do n't look for their lost cows [[TIME]] ...
aliens .
" they 'll be back . "
it ’s the [[ORG]] looking for [[NORP]] collusion
a duck gun could answer questions ! use one !
these are not drones you are looking for . you can go about your business . move along .
their top concern of course is to make sure the fee was paid to be able to fly them .
i just told my son about this story .... he said his friend seen a string of lights in the sky at [[TIME]] on [[DATE]] . this person is from the [[GPE]] area .
i will bet it is godless communists .
time for some double ought buckshot !
[[NORP]] cartels are taking a page out of [[ORG]] 's book : testing drone drug - deal delivery at [[TIME]] .
maybe [[CARDINAL]] of the drones should be " captured " and traced back to the owner ... you are not supposed to fly over other peoples property without permission ... some people know some things ...
let 's review - 6 ' [[GPE]] , operating at [[TIME]] , flying in formation , observed over a large geographic area , reportedly low level and presumably in or near controlled airspace - nothing in there screams private citizen and certainly not a single private citizen . so commercial or government are the only possible logical answers . government , out in that region could be [[ORG]] doing use surveys , [[ORG]] looking for violations , who knows . without a doubt some bureaucrat in any government agency that is fascinated with drones could be let loose to dream up [[MONEY]] fed grants so they can create their own " air force " . commercial ventures are not so likely since they would have to get flight permission and be very transparent with [[ORG]] and other regulators . plus no corporate lawyer would green - light night flights like that ; the liability would be staggering . and [[TIME]] flying would be fairly worthless to things like mapping and surveys . somebody in government likely knows ... they just do n't feel the need to enlighten the unwashed masses .
if you ’re not engaged in nefarious flyovers , why not simply acknowledge who you are and why you are flying drones over these locations in the [[LOC]] ?
[[PERSON]] razor says the simpilest explanation is its just a group of friends getting together to fly their drones around
the drones must be propagating .
yawn ... death star droid scouts ...
maybe it 's a drone flying club that wants to remain anonymous ..
" sheriffs have reached out to [[ORG]] , and [[PERSON]] previously told the newspaper [[ORG]] has denied involvement . the [[ORG]] also told the [[ORG]] [[DATE]] it had no information on the mystery flyers . neither did [[ORG]] nor [[ORG]] command" ... code for they all know ...
do n't worry , yet ... [[ORG]] is just practicing for the main event .
so knock a few out of the sky and see who whines about it ...
easy solution to the mystery .... start blowing the drones out of the air when you see them fly . [[PERSON]] , but still shoot them out of the sky . trust me , someone 's " button " will get pushed and real fast the mystery of the drones will be solved
i had locals on a neighborhood watch commenting on them ! ! in [[GPE]] , very interesting i 'm seeing this on [[PERSON]] as i thought it some local thing .
looking for unlicensed pot farms ?
what s in colo and [[PERSON]] , o the [[ORG]] and will they tell something secret , no we never did unless we got got caught
a drone with a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan is not the consumer camera drone , like the one pictured in the headline . it is something from the military or law enforcement . the " news " article was written to spread more ignorant paranoia about camera drones , which are harmless .
all [[NORP]] should be able to arm themselves with drones that can drop bombs ... what 's the problem . [[ORG]] , amirite ?
i knew this drone stuff would turn into a mess and it has .
are they close when people encounter them ? i wonder how many kinds there are ... 3 maybe ?
probably just practicing for [[DATE]] light show .
[[QUANTITY]] wingspan drones are pretty big . not only that is how the operator keeps in contact with them . they must be using cell towers as relay stations , and it does n't seem much like a hobbyist with money to burn . it does seem like a government terrorist type of thing . maybe this is a a test run of [[PERSON]] [[DATE]] present he was boasting about . back int he 80 's i always want to form an r / c group for model planes to fly between towns with [[CARDINAL]] pilot taking off in town a and another landing it in town b. that was back when micro processors became cheap and portable gps moduals were also . the onboard computer did the rest . btw that was before cell phones .
[[PERSON]] invented the night .
with a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan , a nice rifle would solve the problem . if you take a few of them down , i bet someone would speak up .
shoot [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] of them down and whoever is operating them will come forward ! they 're just bigger clay pigeons than usual !
[[PERSON]] to investigate
do n't shoot it jam it , then watch it fall from the sky and then go get it . make sure you cover the lens when you go to get it . they can see you remember .
it 's just the boys from [[LOC]] shooting another drone episode .
obviously its practice for pro drone pilots . how else do you think the superbowl halftime drones learned to fly . duuuuuh
the scary thing is what if it 's being tested for terrorism ? [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] or [[GPE]] ?
ita a company called [[PERSON]] . they are conducting tests .
fly over my house low and slow enough and i would shoot [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] down . i bet it would be easier to find out who was responsible then .
um , these are fairly easy to shoot down at such altitudes ... and often times legal to do so in a lot of cases .
amazon delivery testing
i would grab my 10 gauge and take one down . then we would see whose it is .
if they fly over my property they should be prepared to be met with overwhelming firepower , [[CARDINAL]] mercy and immediate destruction . other than that , happy [[DATE]] !
“ we have no idea at this point . no leads and no thoughts . it ’s just an odd phenomenon . ” yep , nothing to see here , proceed as usual ... these are the ones that are supposedly protecting us ? ? ?
shhh ! do n't bother them ! its their mating season !
[[GPE]] , [[GPE]] ? another flight hoax ? it was [[DATE]] when you claimed a little boy got caught inside a mylar balloon that floated away . after [[ORDINAL]] responders got involved and the empty balloon landed you said ' oh , he was asleep in attic , sorry . ' [[GPE]] , you have snow , pot , olympic skating . find something to do .
anything bigger than a bird flying in our airspace is being tracked by the government .. they know where these drones are coming from and going to ... most likely military drones .
if they would give us a picture of the drones one could find out who made them .....
aoc sent them looking to where the end of the world will originate from .
so put a helicopter on standby and go intercept [[CARDINAL]] or [[TIME]] .
if the drones weight [[CARDINAL]] lb there are likely laws that are being broken ( [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] part [[CARDINAL]] ) .
is n’t recreational marijuana legal now in [[GPE]] ? i can see someone stoned out of their mind , looking out at [[TIME]] , and yelling “ it ’s those things from [[ORG]] man ! ! ! ” ....

probably a stock photo for this article and not one of the many flying over [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .

i found civilian drones with a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan for sale at $ [[MONEY]] each . this is not some kids playing a prank
we are in the final tribulations and this is part of it . prepare yourselves for the return of the lord in [[DATE]] .
gort , klactu maringa
could be terrorists training for a mission . this should n't be taken lightly , especially given their size .
just something else to worry about !
maybe it 's [[ORG]] flying experimental drones for package deliveries . or it could be creepy [[PERSON]] looking through open windows .
there are a lot of active nuclear missile silos in that region . would not be surprised if it had something to do with that . our government or some country 's government .
well , [[CARDINAL]] thing is for sure ... six to ten , 6'-wing - span drones were n't purchased at the local [[ORG]] . one would think a tad bit sense of urgency might be in order ? idk
these things ca n't fly that far . get your own drone and follow them " home . " the sheriffs out there should have some of these in their budget anyway , indispensable for locating lost people or things in road less terrain .
solution : shotguns and rifles aiming upward if over your land .
the article said they were flying [[QUANTITY]] in the air - might be tough to hit with a shotgun . bird shot probably will be spent by that height , and larger shot may be too few to score a hit .
so , you see something you do n't understand , [[ORDINAL]] thought , kill it . why ?
any nearby ' religion of peace ' training camps ?
[[ORG]] deliveries ...
cars will never fly nor will anyone be able to take to the sky from their back yard . like most things in this country nothing will be done until someone dies .
we are in coup and [[ORG]] is the new compliance officer with silent drone attacks .
those are the [[PRODUCT]] ... in time you will all be assimilated ...
[[QUANTITY]] wing span ? that 's kind of a big drone . [[GPE]] .
shoot - em lizabeth
12 gauge magnum round should do the trick .
12 gauge [[PRODUCT]] birdshot will bring it down easily ! we can investigate from there .

[[PERSON]] has resorted to using drones to find teen girls now that his hookup [[PRODUCT]] is no longer in service
drug dealing drones
10 gauge drone loads should take care of the problem .
[[QUANTITY]] wingspan is most likely too large for a civilian drone .
i am surprised no one has attempted to shoot them down i doubt that the govt does not know who they are .
anyone thought of using a drone to track where they go ? [[PERSON]] .. it ’s been [[DATE]]
most likely delivering pot
its probably the russisns , [[NORP]] , and [[NORP]] doing as they wish while the left distracts everyone with nonstop impeachment bs !
it 's ironic that people get uptight about big brother spying on them but the very same ones getting upset want to purchase and use these drones to spy on everyone else . truth is , our civilization is not mentally responsible enough to manage drones and/or ambulatory robots .
watch it end up being a test trail by [[ORG]] ..
ridaho @ridaho chime in here think this is what you witnessed .
that is [[CARDINAL]] fancy , expensive looking drone . i find it rather pathetic that law enforcement have allowed it to go on for [[DATE]] and they do n't know who is flying them and they continue to allow them to fly . if it 's not the military , shoot them down .
those are some husky drones ... maybe 00 buck ?
its modern day duck hunt . get your guns out and make a drinking game of it .
excerpt from a [[DATE]] article : “ as part of the project , cu boulder obtained a certificate of waiver or authorization ( coa ) from the [[ORG]] that allows [[CARDINAL]] pilot to fly [[CARDINAL]] aircraft at [[CARDINAL]] time . typical approval by the [[ORG]] requires every drone to have its own pilot and one observer who is responsible for watching out for other air traffic , said [[PERSON]] . ” they are developing this technology to find lost hikers or injured wildlife . looks like they are now in a “ testing ” phase .
shoot [[CARDINAL]] down , then you 'll find out who 's using them .

[[ORDINAL]] person to invent a jammer wins [[MONEY]] .
are we sure they are real ? it is [[GPE]] . did they find [[PERSON]] bags near the sightings ?
what the article failed to mention is that the drones appear relatively at the same time [[TIME]] [[TIME]] , they are [[QUANTITY]] wide and have been in swarms of [[CARDINAL]] .
bring [[CARDINAL]] down , the owner will come looking for it .
how do you keep " [[CARDINAL]] " drones in the air at the same time without them crashing into each other ? does that mean it 's [[CARDINAL]] person , on [[CARDINAL]] controller , controlling them all ?
deblasio will say they were sent by [[ORG]] to spy on innocent citizens .
quit trying to find a crime where there is n’t one . have n’t we learned enough from the sham impeachment ?
it 's probably a bunch of nerds having [[TIME]] races .
could it be experimentation for a new way to attack the [[NORP]] population ? i worry about this ! we need to find out what these people flying them are up to .
[[ORG]] is using [[NORP]] tech to deliver the overdue packages of [[NORP]] crap , their delivery drivers stole over [[DATE]] .
i saw a video about this one time where these drones can be used through facial recognition or i guess even reading license plates , and then they were sent down to take out those targets . only the drones i saw were much smaller and more in multitude . sounds like a nice [[ORG]] government project to get ready for the aftermath of the next election .
frequency jammers should do the trick .
it could n't be your over reaching government could it ?
set up barrage balloons . they 'll stop .
drones , were they personal or military grade . personal can only fly about a couple of miles where as military grade can fly [[QUANTITY]] .
yes people you have been and will continue to be watched more and more on ' the land and air and sea ' . it 's the future and it only started [[DATE]] . it 's progressing rapidly .
[[PERSON]] flies drones !
probably just a group of kids
at that height and size , these are commercial , expensive [[ORG]] 's , and as such i believe the [[ORG]] would require flight plans being filed . why on earth would n't one of [[ORG]] have a helicopter follow the [[ORG]] 's back to their lz and find out who is behind this ?
bird shot will fix that .
man has never invented anything the government or evil people ca n’t weaponize .
autonomous flying vehicles ? elon just wants to see if they crash as much as his truck .

i wonder what the cost of a drone with a [[CARDINAL]] ' wingspan is . a squadron of them should n't be that hard to trace .
[[NORP]] . it 's just got ta be [[NORP]] colluding with [[ORG]] [[PERSON]]
birdshot will solve that problem quickly .
a squadron of drones with [[CARDINAL]] ’ wingspans ... think [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] , etc .
it 's the [[ORG]] looking for possible [[NORP]] voters in the [[LOC]] . so far no sitings
shoot [[CARDINAL]] down . that 'll get an investigation going but also might get someone arrested for doing it . i't very illegal to shoot one down for no reason .
modern spying
if they 're going [[QUANTITY]] [[ORG]] , they're breaking the law . but other reports on this have said they 're flying at a [[CARDINAL]] ft level . but this article is the [[ORDINAL]] to mention they hover , eliminating winged models . i 'd like to know how they determined " [[QUANTITY]] wingspan " on a flying drone at [[TIME]] .
shoot them down .
open season on drones and a good shotgun with # [[MONEY]] shot should deal effectively with the problem .
when a sheriff says this : “ it ’s all above board — even if it ’s a bit disconcerting ” . he knows who and why . how does he know it ’s all above board ?
the [[ORG]] will do something after there is a midair collision and a plane or helicopter goes down .
this is where you break out the new shotgun with [[CARDINAL]] buck . problems resolved . when they come looking .. you found them ...
the future is going to sound like swarms of bees ! ! no peace , just constant buzzing morning till [[TIME]] ! ! welcome to the future ! !

reminds me of the movie " [[WORK_OF_ART]] "
bad things will happen with drones [[DATE]] .
i do n't know what they are doing or who is controlling them , but i do know that if multiple [[ORG]] 's with a [[QUANTITY]] wing span were flying over my area on multiple occasions i would want to know something about them . it obviously is n't aliens or something silly , but it could be something nefarious or dangerous or it could be something completely innocent
you just know it 's a group of bored teenagers as there is n't all that much to do in rural [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] . that it has the locals all fired up is just a bonus .
go to throwflame.com buy a flame thrower drone melt them
[[ORG]]
drone club meeting .
sounds like a bunch of guys playing with their fpv ( [[ORDINAL]] person view ) rc planes they specifically built for the task of driving everyone insane . they can easily fly [[QUANTITY]] . i have no problem if folks want to take a crack at shooting em down .
new way to deal even in prisons
it 's just sad to watch the evolution of conspiracy theories on these message boards . you can actually witness the dumbing down of a nation in real time .
down south we have similar problems with the mosquitos . at least drones do n't bite !
[[ORG]] services . get your meth here .... meth ... get your meth here ......
time for some night vision goggles and target practice .
drug dealing drones
beyond line of sight testing
pizza deliveries ...
[[ORG]]
[[ORG]] making deliveries !
nobody is stepping up to claim them ? [[QUANTITY]] wingspan ... those drones ca n't be the $ [[MONEY]] variety . shoot one down and i 'm betting somebody will step up and claim ownership .
[[ORG]]
quit talking about it and do something about it .
i own a drone and enjoy flying it but its not normal to fly them at [[TIME]] so maybe its a challenge for these guys to be out at [[TIME]] .
could be more of obama 's spying .
aliens !
unmanned aerial vehicle ( [[ORG]] ) is the proper term . ' drone ' is used by amateurs .
i bought my first drone [[DATE]] , and i have nt broke it yet .
12 gauge with buck shot will solve the problem .
shut them down !
the [[NORP]] party insisting that they are [[NORP]] drones looking for election machines in rural [[GPE]]
kids and their [[DATE]] presents
animal rights radicals are always bragging about their fleet of drones .
no photos or [[GPE]] ?
maybe [[ORG]] is practicing their new delivery method . sooner or later [[GPE]] will end up with all of your money !
we need to get a fleet of [[ORG]] and arm them with semi auto [[CARDINAL]] gauges
[[ORG]] delivery drones .
new version of sporting clays ?
drones do n't have ' [[PERSON]] ' so they [[ORG]] have a ' wing span '
they are smuggling drugs , or maybe even lightweight illegals .
it 's not a phenomenon . that would be a naturally occurring thing . this is someone or some people flying these things .
new grub hub or uber eats delivery service ... maybe escorting services ....
one can never over estimate the ability of people to take something / technology that can be a force for the advancement good and knowledge and make at minimum a nuisance or at worst a menace out of it .
it 's an experiment to determine what people will do if there is actually an alien invasion and at this point , it appears nothing .
anybody own a shotgun ? sounds like a fun night if you have some night vision ! ! !
how about these drones were a very popular [[DATE]] present , or , those millennials who live in their parents basements all got together on social media and planed this like the new trend of [[ORG]] ?
since all drones have to be registered with the [[ORG]] what 's the big mystery ? the sheriff says it 's all above board , did n't he
green lasers will blind their optics !
then it seems they are fair game to shoot down .
why is the truth deleted ?
they are not really drones , just disguised as drones to make you think they are drones to throw you off base to think they are drones .
no way to know that her drones ate [[CARDINAL]] ft .
[[ORG]] practice anyone .
there are no civilian drones sold to the public with [[QUANTITY]] wingspans . the fact that they are large , and flying in formation leads me to believe that they are military . they do n’t always acknowledge their work . aliens would not look in [[GPE]] for intelligent life .
if it 's not illegal and they are n't doing anything wrong , move along .
[[QUANTITY]] wingspan ? i never heard of a drone that big !
[[ORG]] rules state that you must have line of sight when flying your drone day or [[TIME]] . no laws broken .
you can fly a drone at [[TIME]] .
stop whining and start shooting . [[DATE]] gets them every time and they wo n't come back ! a little matter of air space rights over your land .
drones with [[QUANTITY]] wingspans ? that is not an ordinary civilian commercially bought drone . and [[CARDINAL]] at a time hovering makes it even more odd . most quad rotor drones are [[CARDINAL]] ” , even semi professional ones like the dji inspire . very odd
just shoot one down and you will know the answer .
i 'm surprised every duck hunter in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] has n't converged on the area . compared to ducks , drones are real easy to hit .
if they are flying at [[TIME]] how do they determine they have a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan ? that would be one huge drone and would not be something a " hobbyist " would own , let alone several . that would mean these would more than likely be commercial drones and would require pilots to fly under part [[CARDINAL]] , which does not allow for [[TIME]] flying . if these were hobbyist pilots , they would be allowed to fly at [[TIME]] , and are doing nothing illegal .
if there low enough nothing a [[CARDINAL]] g could n't fix like duck hunting
no was to know that the drones are [[CARDINAL]] ft ? could be just regular sized .
the article does n't make clear whether or not a law is being broken .
somebody ’s standing guard over their weed patch .
are they in a " v " ? they could be just migrating ?
they using heat seekers to search for blow growers
this is so stupid law enforcement can track signals back to locations have technology to take down drones no mystery just do your job . otherwise its probably law enforcement or govt doing the droning .
yep . it 's got ta be the [[NORP]] drug cartels . ever since [[ORG]] started building that border wall in [[GPE]] the [[NORP]] have been going nuts there .
they may be peeping toms
most likely mapping . game companies have done that in the past . and to those saying " shoot them down " , they are breaking no laws . leave them alone
[[NORP]] monitoring grave yards to get the vote out 🤯
[[GPE]] ’s deep state [[ORG]] is planning an attack on [[GPE]] making it look like [[GPE]] . she just ca n’t stand the [[ORG]] of a president named [[PERSON]] !
anyone try " drone " hunting with a goose gun yet ?
time to watch [[WORK_OF_ART]] re - runs .
thieves scoping out targets ?
advanced [[GPE]] controlled systems ?
these have a limited flight time . all it takes to find out who the operating entity may be is to track them when they land . it 's not rocket surgery to solve this ' mystery ' .
[[GPE]] ...
fly [[CARDINAL]] over my property and it 's the last time you 'll see it . everyone in my family is a good shot .
some ack ack from a goose gun will bring the owner out in a hurry !
[[QUANTITY]] wingspan , over the horizon ( autonomous navigation ) , across state lines ? sounds military ... much larger than the average commercial drone .
really good reason to take that plug out of your shotgun ... open season , no bag limit
[[PERSON]] .
probably just a bunch of rich college kids playing with their new [[DATE]] presents ... or aliens , better get a tin foil hat just in case !
? ? ? ? nobody has a 10ga and a spot light ? [[ORDINAL]] high brass ? ? ?
it could be [[ORG]] 's delivery testing [[QUANTITY]] away ?
pretty soon we 're going to have illegals falling from the sky , [[CARDINAL]] ' wing span ... a few modifications and boom you got your illegal immigrant dropper - offer !
if i had a drone that size i would be making beer runs with it ....
if obama was still in office the drones over civilians would worry me .
maybe it 's a drone gang , like a motorcycle gang
scully and [[PERSON]] are on it .
being a drone pilot myself , i can say that night flying is approved if one has taken a knowledge test and training that goes with [[TIME]] flying , as well as having the drone equipped with the proper anti - collision lighting visible for [[QUANTITY]] . the drones flying over the [[LOC]] are probably collecting some type of data and equipped with [[TIME]] vision cameras or even infrared cameras . no laws are being broken .
nothing that offering unlimited hunting licenses would n't cure . offer them , give a start date and let people know they need to control their little friends or they may not have them by [[TIME]] .
i have no doubt this is on orders of [[ORG]] . what are those villains up to ?
it 's trump looking for dirt on [[PERSON]] - he heard [[PERSON]] was involved in the [[GPE]] weed industry and [[PERSON]] refused to go to [[GPE]]
shot one down and see who calls about their exspensive drone . questions answered
chariots of the gods ... they're fallin out of the sky all the time .
send up an [[PRODUCT]] .
what facilities , military bases , mines , kids who belong to drone clubs , cartels , etc .. in those areas . start there . oh , yeah ...... and [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] . likely cartels .
if somehow can incorporate a christmas theme this would have the makings of a great [[ORG]] movie ...
back in the day i used to fly radio controlled model airplanes . [[GPE]] on those ran [[QUANTITY]] . we had someone about a mile from the club who would call the sheriffs department [[DATE]] or any other time we would fly . all it came down to is some people just ca n’t stand to see anyone have a good time . fast forwards to present times . people are so paranoid borderline panic attack . they think aliens are invading or terrorist attacking . it would be funny if not so pathetic .
sounds like some kind of drug deal goin on . the [[GPE]] is awash in drugs now .
get all you friend a bunch of [[CARDINAL]] gages and let em loose . if legal not drug cartels the owners will surface real quick ! if drug cartels money = party . drugs dependent on [[DATE]] party
[[QUANTITY]] wingspan ... not your typical multi - rotor consumer - grade toy .
i 'd say it might be trump scouting for some strange in the hinterlands .
kids having fun , oh the carnage .
the census count has begun .
[[PERSON]]
the [[CARDINAL]] liberal candidates finally figured out their [[DATE]] presents , and got off track to find [[GPE]] !
unnerving for sure .
[[ORG]] ?
12 gauge practice targets .
faa- [[ORG]] . get it right !
practice practice practice
[[PERSON]] . respectfully it ’s not your county . it ’s the people ’s county . remember that .
let me break the case , its [[NORP]] looking for collusion ....
[[QUANTITY]] wing span for a drone is pretty big .
just blast em
[[QUANTITY]] wide ! these are definitely not consumer grade , these are military or science grade drones .
drones with some generic programming slaved to [[CARDINAL]] remote , yawn . crop circles were more interesting .
take them down , remove the footage to see what they 're recording , and crush it . that 's the only way to be sure . however , my guess is amazon .
this blog is full of idiots ... shoot this , shoot that . you do n't own the sky . there are no 6 ' drones available to the public . my drone is one of the best one 's out there and it is [[DATE]] " rotor tip to rotor tip . it is used for aerial photography . they say it has a range of [[QUANTITY]] , but in reality , it is about 1 . so , these have to be commercial or governmental , or as one said , maybe [[ORG]] , but then again , they would have to file with the local airport authority , if they are within [[QUANTITY]] of an airport .
squadrons of [[CARDINAL]] ' drones operating every night without an explanation is certainly a [[ORG]] 's business . if the [[ORG]] is n't concerned , he knows who , what , and why . he either does n't want to say or he is assisting who ever is operating the drones . either way the sheriff may not be a person the public should fully trust .
wow sheriff really?a phenomenon?that is something unexplainable . people are flying drones for a reason . that is not a phenomenon . dont they have a police helicopter and can follow them ?
this is no mystery , it is about [[ORG]] people , if you want to know who is doing it , invest [[TIME]] and follow it , because that is about the battery life .
if its a problem they can bring them down with a radio drone jammer . search " how to build a radio drone jammer for $ [[MONEY]] " from the trenches world report which is good for [[QUANTITY]] . then you can sell the drone back to the bad guys or destroy it .
were the [[PERSON]] 's security team or any of their friends ever in that area ? they could be searching for bodies .
drugs
i doubt a person could control [[CARDINAL]] or possibly [[CARDINAL]] drones at a time and the are probably in line of sight ca nt be too far it does nt seem that hard to catch up to them , if they flee they lose their precious drone or it takes awile to retrieve it just saying
my pellet gun has taken down several so far . fly over my home more than once or even hover over it one time and its out of the sky
it could easily be just one guy . tune all the drone receivers to the same command module , and you 'd control the whole squadron .
these people are going to be screaming at the sky when [[ORG]] starts nationwide drone delivery .
what else is there to do ?
to my fellow [[ORG]] conversationalists ... wishing you and yours a great new decade . [[DATE]] : * re - elect president [[PERSON]] * give [[NORP]] control of the [[ORG]] * and * [[ORG]] * continue a healthy economy * and put the many guilty parties responsible for [[ORG]] collusion behind bars happy [[EVENT]] !
this is part of [[ORG]] 's deep state .
transfer of weed from a legal zone to an illegal zone ?
i would say it 's a group of guys ( or maybe just one with them linked together ) flying them around to simulate ufo flyovers , except that these babies should a little large and a little too coordinate to be just a fun prankster . who knows .
target practice
lock and load
[[GPE]] military searching for terrorist camps in the mountains ..... easier to pick up their heat signature at night time ..... that 's my theory .
it ’s amazon with my package i have n’t got yet .
the [[CARDINAL]] liberal candidates finally figured out their [[DATE]] presents !
nerd squadron !
[[CARDINAL]] with a scope should slow them down
ca nt anyone shoot there ?
conspiracy theories ... must be a [[NORP]] town .
now is the time to try out the ronco pocket emp you got for [[DATE]] .
[[GPE]] shoot [[CARDINAL]] down and do an autopsy .
frequency jamming is the safest way to defeat them
it 's [[ORG]] testing their delivery program , if it were to happen .
[[PERSON]] 😱
it ’s [[PERSON]] trying to look in childrens ’ windows .
mind your own bussiness .... [[MONEY]] trumpdrones2020 # trump2020landslide
[[GPE]] ! ! !
check for an [[ORG]] warehouse near by , they could be practicing for deliveries .
i saw some lurking over [[EVENT]] .
get your own drone and expert flyer and follow them . heck , i bet after reading this story , some enthusiast will volunteer their own drone and time .
either [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] .
[[PERSON]] ....
that is a peak time for pizza delivery ......
shoot one down and see who complains about it .
lawn mower man ... he took out [[CARDINAL]] of my men .. in a way i 've never seen before ...
it 's the [[NORP]] searching for more articles of impeachment .
well , you see , i was out bird hunting and saw something flying and well ... i shot and that 's how it happened .
hopefully they 're armed and heading to [[ORG]] , [[ORG]] 's , and [[GPE]] 's house
they 're here ...
ca n't be anything good .
just get granny with her shotgun and she will get your answer for you .
just a little clarity for the calamity ... the users of these drones might be violating [[ORG]] - but that is not criminal . it is only a regulation . only [[ORG]] can inact laws . also , if the drones are not registered - which is still not a criminal offense - then the serial number is largely useless . also , some commercial and military drones do have a [[CARDINAL]] ' wingspan . no idea what or why the drone activity - but flying multiple large drones in close proximity , at [[TIME]] , even with [[ORG]] or a flight management system requires several skilled drone pilots with more technology than the average recreational drone operator . however , the same flight management software could auto - fly the drones in grid patterns as described - but that type of flying , for multiple devices is not you average hobbyist . this could be as simple as commercial or military testing new equipment - or commercial operators performing lidar surveying - or ( of concern ) a rogue group learning to fly and operate in unison . sheriffs should take this serious . a drone with a [[CARDINAL]] ' wingspan could carry more than a camera . also , this is noticeably close to dia . despite the humor in the comments , the operators should be found .
" drones with [[QUANTITY]] wingspans " ?
a good rifle would solve this . shoot it down , and look too who manufactured it .... and trace it from there ...
avoiding ring
terrain mapping . case closed .
seems a 6 ft wingspan would potentially carry a lot of weight ...... is there an [[ORG]] or [[ORG]] fulfillment center close by ?
the sheriff should shoot one down to see what 's in it .
shoot the drones down a good strong shotgun could do the job .
i would say the [[ORG]] is lying
[[PERSON]] for president campaign committee looking for places to set up new offices in the area .
i 'm not saying it 's aliens … … . but it 's aliens
i thought all drones were supposed to be registered with the [[ORG]] ? not positive but i thought i remembered something about that . correct me if i am wrong please .. gently .. it is an actual question .
yeah , no big deal . let 's just wait until they blow something up , then we 'll worry about it .
wait until they go nano and then fly inside your body
google maps ! !
i thought it was federal law that drone operators had to be within a certain distance of their drones .
take them out . then you willfind the owners .
[[ORG]] down ...
a sniper will resolve this in no time !
“ we have no idea at this point . no leads and no thoughts . it ’s just an odd phenomenon . ” — [[PERSON]] sheriff carlton britton . great police work [[PERSON]] .
are they anywhere near our electrical power grid ?
thus far , it ’s all been speculation as to who is flying the drones with [[QUANTITY]] wingspans and what their purpose might be . a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan is big enough to carry drugs ... i ca n't see [[ORG]] of any other [[ORG]] needing more thasn one to fly a flir rig to look for illegals ... interesting ... some producer filming [[TIME]] shots for a movie like , " [[PERSON]] has fallen " ? and , you must have an [[ORG]] license to fly something that big .. curioser and curioser ... anyone try to shoot one down yet ? just how much of [[GPE]] is gun hating , anyway ...
poachers . the plot of several of [[PERSON]] mystery novels ( our hero is [[PERSON]] a game warden akin to [[ORG]] ) incorporated poachers tracking antelope and deer herds with drone fleets . apparently way too common for [[DATE]] now . maybe the locals should pick up a book .
[[ORG]] ?
most likely [[ORG]] . they do n't even trust their own agents . that being said , they have a new facility under the new [[FAC]] . which makes common sense due the the limited flight time of the drones .
drones should be illegal . furthermore , it should n't be a crime to take them down . they are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy .
wait . [[CARDINAL]] ft wingspans and sometimes they hover ? a fixed wing is not able to hover .
they are looking for [[ORG]] 's brain .
according to this [[TIME]] 's [[ORG]] site , waivers are still required for night flight or flight out of visual range ( paragraphs , [[CARDINAL]] and [[CARDINAL]] , respectively ) . if they are flying at [[TIME]] , the [[ORG]] should know about it . seems like regulation of drone flights is going the same way guns regulations are going . law beakers do n't care , nor will the [[ORG]] do anything until there is a disaster .
i 'm sure it 's [[ORG]] up to something else no good
some farmer will mistakenly shoot one down thinking it was a chicken hawk , then we 'll know .
must have [[ORG]] - vision , else how does one fly a line - of - sight drone ? [[QUANTITY]] and above needs a blinking red light to warn aircraft ( as in radio towers ) .
drones are both a menace and creepy . some people and their toys !
oh , i do not know , maybe delivering things they should not be like drugs .
most likely kids smoking weed
come on ..... same folks that did crop circles . laughing every morning ! !
[[PERSON]] is test flying [[PERSON]] inventions .
so , a drone flying hobbyist causes a national crisis ?
[[ORG]] is training for the rebellion .
beware ! … the crab people have finally learned how to fly …
nite all ! sleep tight !
lol another nail biting story from [[ORG]] . feeds the weak minds of it ’s readers an opportunity to tighten tin cap .
it sounds like a military drone . i can not for the life of me think of the need for a [[QUANTITY]] wingspan for any other use .
covert surveillance or smuggling operation . petition [[ORG]] to set up some anti - uav weapons and shoot them down .
anti gun groups using [[PRODUCT]] detectors .
of course the government is going to lie about it . start shooting them down and trace the serial numbers and you 'll find out real quick .
" alexa , destroy all inbound threats ! "
[[NORP]] delivering [[DATE]] . now can we please move on to the next story .
they are n't drones . [[ORG]] up with [[GPE]] and they figured out how to shrink objects . they are a highly trained squad of made up of the most elite squad of killers this planet has ever seen . strap in folks this is gon na get bumpy . lol my [[ORG]] version .
hunters tracking game at [[TIME]] . trying to learn the animal ’s patterns . possibly a predator is killing livestock .
just wait until we have armed drones with a hive mentality ! things are about to get real interesting !
dope ...... betcha a box of donuts .....
can you say pellet gun or .22 ? you will find out who is doing that real fast .
[[ORG]] deliveries .
[[PERSON]] drones from [[GPE]] into [[GPE]] .
[[CARDINAL]] ft . '' [[PERSON]] '' ? .... in multiples ? it 's drugs
my dji has a [[QUANTITY]] range . the [[ORG]] knows exactly where they are when they are flying they use [[ORG]] .
locals should publically declare these flights a possible danger and that residents are free to shoot them down . the full story will spill out before or shortly after the fist drone hits the ground .
dope is legal in [[GPE]] ..... not in [[GPE]] ......
well do n't drone on about it .
i do n't know anything about flying " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " , but i know i 'll fly down to my polling station on [[DATE]] to vote for president [[PERSON]] . [[ORG]] mr. president ! ! !
[[CARDINAL]] ft . '' wingspans '' ? ... in multiples ? it 's drugs
well , we know it was n't [[GPE]] , or else they would be denying it !
nobody knows ? if i was a enemy of the [[GPE]] this would be a good platform for eavesdropping .
it 's the government ! looking for undeclared property improvements made without building permits , and for increasing property taxes . drones are cheaper than helicopters previously used for the purpose .
hmmmm ... bunch of kids ( and immature adults ) trying out their new [[DATE]] presents . next ...
[[PERSON]] will let them deliver goods to form a solid case against perps .
shoot it !
well they 're drone ufos , obviously .
we need [[PERSON]] with tasers , i m thinking [[QUANTITY]] put a drone station , [[CARDINAL]] drone patrol [[QUANTITY]] . no more wall jumpers .
i think they 're looking for escaped mutants , trying to flee to [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] is just on the way .
simultaneously " [[GPE]] launches drone strikes in [[GPE]] after deadly car bombing . " i 'm guessing military training .
drugs involved .
[[ORG]] deliveries of course !
if you have a shotgun , time for some target shooting if they get low enough .
the truth is out there
if the cops really wanted to know they could take one down , get the serial number and do some uhhh i do n't know investigating . just a thought .
