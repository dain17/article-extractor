[[GPE]] is being smart . running out of low - grade weapons , it 's using low grade weapons from [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] to sustain the attack on the [[GPE]] . saving their own better stuff .
their cruise missiles are the low grade stuff ? btw , does [[GPE]] have any high grade military leadership left ?
by [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] standard , [[NORP]] “ better ” stuff is junk
their better stuff has been used up . that 's why they 're getting munitions and equipment from [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
their best stuff has n't even been deployed yet . meanwhile [[ORG]] nations are crying about their arsenals being depleted and say they ca n't keep it up much longer .
nope
.general kellogg and general [[PERSON]] are shills for the [[GPE]] defense industry . he is correct [[CARDINAL]] thing [[GPE]] has had a good couple of weeks . but do n't think that is the begining of the end . the counter offense in the north was accomplished by [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] troops trained by [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] , plus [[CARDINAL]] to [[CARDINAL]] mercenaries made up with many [[GPE]] , [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] contract fighters paid for by [[GPE]] with funds from [[GPE]] taxpayers . you would think with the recent success by [[GPE]] it would be perfect time to negotiate an end to conflict . but no , the escalation starts .
all this because [[PERSON]] refused to discuss [[ORG]] justified concerns with [[ORG]] expansion .
and now [[ORG]] expanded thanks to [[PERSON]]
all this because [[PERSON]] wanted a land - grab .
ww3 floating right under sleepy [[PERSON]] 's radar . god bless our youth .
i hear [[GPE]] may have some surplus supplies . maybe we could resupply our dwindling arms from them ?
after [[PERSON]] went under in [[DATE]] , one of [[LOC]] largest customers for used [[NORP]] helicopters and small arms was [[GPE]] . might as well . i 'd rather a friendly government get our leftovers . i 'd bet friendly governments are buying [[NORP]] military equipment from the [[NORP]] and the [[NORP]] are buying [[ORG]] . they hold up better .
except they have one less black hawk that they crashed recently while trying to learn to fly it .
they ran out of scud missiles
apparently , this [[GPE]] counteroffensive is n't as big of a " victory " as [[FAC]] and [[ORG]] hypes it to be . the recaptured areas had [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] troops consisting mostly of police units and reserve troops . they were pulled out immediately to save [[NORP]] from being captured or killed . they did leave their heavy equipment behind which the [[NORP]] use as props in their propaganda stunts which [[ORG]] eagerly eats up : " look , look , the [[NORP]] are blowing up [[NORP]] tanks . note that this [[GPE]] advance has stopped now that it ran into the real [[NORP]] defensive positions manned by regular troop . in [[DATE]] , the [[NORP]] will realize that they are trapped in a killing zone as the [[NORP]] counter offensive begins .
so , mobilization might soon be coming . got your bags packed yuri ? bring soap . not for you , but for that [[PERSON]] you 'll be sharing a foxhole with . i hear they do n't bathe .
remember [[ORG]] is owned by [[PERSON]] , yeah a [[NORP]] …
? [[ORG]] ?
well , [[ORG]] wo n’t be participating … .
so ... [[GPE]] only having [[ORG]] troops controlling an area the size of [[GPE]] , with equipment they do n't know how to operate , is proof of [[NORP]] military genius ... whatever you say [[PERSON]] ...
your basing your assessment on [[NORP]] intel ? ok , wanna buy a hastily compiled dossier on [[NORP]] wmds ? [[ORG]] nothing why do n't ya ?
[[PERSON]] 's " " foolish political involvement with [[GPE]] to get votes .... is backfiring as it only positions [[GPE]] for more death and destruction ...... plus wasting [[GPE]] tax payers money ..... midterms ... will determine a '' new direction for this [[PERSON]] mess ......
i heard that [[NORP]] drones had a lot of issues just like the [[NORP]] military . i doubt that all have been solved
never seen any technology come out of [[GPE]] . even the former [[GPE]] brought a car to the [[GPE]] market ! never seen any tech out of [[GPE]] either . they 're failed states due to oppressive political regimes - they 're in [[DATE]] .
in fairness , the [[PERSON]] was a very bad copy of a [[ORG]] .
it took [[DATE]] of himars strikes to put potholes in the [[PERSON]] bridge . it took a single [[NORP]] precision missile strike on [[ORG]] to destroy the power plant , dam , bridge , and every ukr bridgehead on the [[NORP]] river . the city is flooded and scores of ukr troops are trapped on the east side and are currently being decimated . the [[NORP]] took out the electricity on [[DATE]] so that people would n't get electrocuted while wading through the floodwaters [[DATE]] .
if [[GPE]] blew up some [[NORP]] dams , you would be ok with that ?
yes , it is after all a war …
you ’re onto something . [[ORG]] needs to start providing cruise missiles to [[GPE]] . i ’m all for it .
so your dropping the [[ORG]] is defensive narrative ?
[[GPE]] is defending itself . they deserve help with that . are you dropping the " this is not a war , just a special military operation " narrative ?
the problem with [[NORP]] drones is that they have to stop flying [[CARDINAL]] times a day to pray towards [[GPE]] .
yeah you can tell by the way they crashed …
hence the reason the [[GPE]] should support [[GPE]] over [[GPE]] . even countries are known by the company they keep .
i hope you do n't vote [[NORP]] then , pallets of cash for [[GPE]] and all that ....
a [[ORG]] official , who remained anonymous , in [[DATE]] told [[ORG]] that some munition supplies have hit " uncomfortably low " levels . do n't shot all of your bullets thinking there 's only [[CARDINAL]] bad guy !
easy win for [[GPE]] weapons .
a laboratory for wwiii .
[[PERSON]] and his invasion are finished , sooner or later , [[GPE]] lost ..
so maybe the [[NORP]] actually got one of those drones made in [[GPE]] to work ? understood they were having problems with the drones not functioning right . quality control issues ? or design problems ? maybe operator error on the [[NORP]] end .
“ [[GPE]] has built up an arsenal of locally produced drones and exported drone technologies to its allies , enhancing [[GPE]] ’s ability to threaten the [[GPE]] and its [[NORP]] allies . from [[DATE]] to the present , [[GPE]] has continuously advanced its military [[ORG]] program , seeking to improve its fleets ’ intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance capabilities and to field [[ORG]] able to carry out airstrikes . in [[DATE]] , in particular , [[GPE]] has unveiled numerous new drone systems , many of which have been used in combat , demonstrating the advancements [[GPE]] has made in the [[ORG]] space . [[GPE]] now claims to have drones capable of delivering precision - guided missiles with ranges of 2000 km . , flight endurances over [[TIME]] , and stealth capabilities . while its boasts are often exaggerated for propagandistic purposes , the advancement of its drone program represents a technological triumph for [[GPE]] . ”
do n't knock [[NORP]] drones . they were designed on [[GPE]] technology from the ones the [[NORP]] captured from [[GPE]] .
sounds like they ’re performing like [[GPE]] ’s aircraft carrier .
they 're nothing but cheap , [[ORDINAL]] rate knockoffs . just like the garbage that comes from [[GPE]] .
that downed [[ORG]] looks like it was made by [[PERSON]] or sauder .
mr. [[PERSON]] 's [[ORDINAL]] grade shop class .
geeze , if the [[NORP]] sell off their stocks of munitions to the [[NORP]] , what will they have to defend themselves with eh ? nice that the [[NORP]] are providing all that nice flight signature data on the [[NORP]] drones , eh ?
[[GPE]] has been a major exporter of arms for over [[CARDINAL]] generations . you must not read much . they ’re biggest export is weapons .
geeze , if the nk folks have such a manufacturing capacity , why are they selling back munitions that they bought from [[GPE]] , eh missy ? btw , i think that what " arms " the nk folks trade with are small arms and ammunition , eh ?
drones built with obama pallet cash
mighty [[NORP]] war machine ...
too many [[NORP]] bots here . no real [[NORP]] is siding with the [[NORP]] on this one ... we prefer winners .
far more [[NORP]] bots here . real [[NORP]] want to fix [[GPE]] and protect our borders instead of arming dictator countries like [[GPE]] .
real [[NORP]] know that our support for [[GPE]] transcends its people and border . if we do not rebuff [[PERSON]] 's brazen attempt at [[NORP]] reunification in [[GPE]] , incursions into [[ORG]] countries could be next , leading to direct [[GPE]] military involvement under our treaty obligations
you must be a millennial bc you ca n't remember [[EVENT]] .
nah , real [[NORP]] realize the less [[NORP]] there are the better off the world is
must be a woke radical - [[GPE]] too white for you ?
[[ORG]] neocon warmongers would - the spawn of the original [[NORP]] [[ORG]] .
millennial with either a very short memory or no education at all .
countries that oppress their people against countries who pretend they do n't .
so what ’s the point of this [[LAW]] shipped [[CARDINAL]] in weapons to [[GPE]] - so [[GPE]] bought a few [[NORP]] drones … …
the brit " intelligence " should find [[PERSON]] 's wmds [[ORDINAL]] .
fact : [[PERSON]] did at one time possess wmds in the form of chemical weapons . we know this because he used them against the [[NORP]] and the [[NORP]] , that is well documented . fact : when he signed the cease fire that ended guld war i he agreed to destroy his wmds and allow [[ORG]] weapons inspectors to verify they were destroyed . he spent [[DATE]] playing games with the weapons inspectors to prevent them from being able to verify the weapons had been destroyed and he had none remaining . speculation : he did that to keep his enemies guessing about whether he still had any wmds so they would think twice about attacking ? anyway , if [[PERSON]] had come clean about his wmds and let the [[ORG]] inspectors do their job and verify their destruction he might still be alive [[DATE]] .
and we know that because the [[ORG]] gave it to [[PERSON]] and told him to use it .
where are they ? it is [[DATE]] since war criminal george used them to go to war ! where are they ?
in [[GPE]] if there are any left .
[[GPE]] has gotten far more weaponry from the [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] .
and [[DATE]] the [[NORP]] dictator begs for more . what a get rich scheme for them .
no duh , sherlock and will continue to get it until [[PERSON]] is beaten .
back to your den , [[PERSON]] . i did n't give you permission . sherlock
what , from a sling shot ?
how sad does the [[NORP]] military have to be that they 're using [[NORP]] drones ? [[PRODUCT]] .
and [[GPE]] is using [[NORP]] drones - what ’s your point ?
[[GPE]] is n’t the mighty [[ORG]] . that ’s the point . the [[ORG]] is a [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] has more nukes than [[GPE]] . that ’s their weapon . try striking at [[GPE]] like we do to broke backs like [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] and see the real [[ORG]] .
[[GPE]] has [[ORG]] of world militaries , a paper tiger that runs on vodka
oh how the mighty have fallen . i ca n't believe i spent so much time training in the [[ORG]] to counter the big red threat . they were no threat at all apparently .
that was [[GPE]] . [[GPE]] on its own is a different story .
they still have some pretty potent capabilities and a nut for a leader .
famous last words when the air raid sirens go off signaling nukes on the way .
[[PERSON]] ! [[PERSON]] !
it 'll be way to late by the time you hear air raid sirens .
boring ... quit slacking off & play to win comrade .
so [[GPE]] is doing what [[GPE]] is doing . so what , it 's a war , have at it and may the best country win . not our problem .
yes [[PERSON]] , sure
why is [[ORG]] not covering how effectively [[GPE]] is regaining territory from [[GPE]] ?
agh zip it plenty of articles on here about that
why do leftist sights not allow you to comment ?
sights or sites ? the unedjumakted want to know
the uneducated probably do n’t have knowledge of autocorrect , or the fact that sentences should start with a capital and end with a period .
they do . but every now and again folks here need exposure to a fact .
really ? name [[CARDINAL]] leftist “ news ” organization that allows you to .
why is [[PERSON]] not covering how [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] nazis died in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] ?
for the same reason they 're not covering how many [[CARDINAL]] of [[NORP]] unicorns died in [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .
is there any increase in the [[GPE]] production of our own weapons and ammo ?
the war machine is going like crazy , i 'm not in the market , but everything i have heard and seen says they 're hiring
well they did n't buy them to deliver pizzas
this might seem like a lot of money , but this was a very cost effective way to see and analyze [[NORP]] military tactics ( or lack ) ; study their weaponry ( not very good as it turns out ) ; analyze [[GPE]] 's command and control structure ( fatally flawed ) ; supply chain methodology and measure the political will of [[GPE]] . we got this for [[MONEY]] and did n't get any [[GPE]] military killed and ... helped save a country . money well spent i 'd say .
that 's all you have to say now because the [[GPE]] spent [[MONEY]] to prop up the [[NORP]] and the [[NORP]] are still winning against our best weapons .
so losing territory the size of [[GPE]] and [[CARDINAL]] tanks , armored vehicles , artillery pieces and [[CARDINAL]] ammunition dumps is " winning " . pretty odd definition tovarisch ...
one can imagine the quality of weapons coming out of those [[CARDINAL]] .... holes .
more [[NORP]] troops have been defecting rather than fighting . [[PERSON]] has a horrible retention rate in this war . they even tried to pay [[NORP]] war criminals to be mercenaries and they preferred to stay in their home war zone . so yeah , he 's down to buying [[ORDINAL]] tier drones , not surprising . when he defaults on the nation 's next loan payments it will be the final nail in his coffin . may the god 's continue to bless [[GPE]] and the battle against fascism and dictators
as a former combat soldier , i hope you are correct , but the soldier in me believes that [[GPE]] is a long way from retiring from the field .
no problem , that just means more dead [[NORP]]
putins field is retiring on him . he will keep on keeping on until assassination but i do n't think that 's too far off . there 's a lot of windows for him to avoid
defense contractors in [[DATE]] warned that sustaining [[GPE]] ’s war effort was depleting the weapon supplies the [[GPE]] had . keep shooting , we 'll make more .
love the [[ORG]]
and how does that happen ? oh , [[ORG]] has to authorize the spending , and then authorize sending it ? [[PERSON]] will be bending over for [[GPE]] by then .
will be interesting to see the [[NORP]] response .
[[GPE]] has to use [[NORP]] drones and [[ORG]] is worried about [[GPE]] attacking other member nation [[ORG]] ?
yes things change quickly , [[GPE]] is exposing [[GPE]] as the paper tiger that it is it 's going to take a while for the world to realize how badly they got fooled by the [[NORP]]
[[CARDINAL]] of dead [[ORG]] and [[ORG]] who died in kharkiv against [[ORG]] , what was already withdrawing , would disagree with you .
i would think they would be using the [[PERSON]] we left in [[GPE]] to use against us . been done many times before .
we did n't leave any drones in [[GPE]] . a few prop driven aircraft , like [[PERSON]] and rotary assets like [[ORG]] .
oh yeah , because the [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] are on such good terms with [[GPE]] .
the [[ORG]] just singed a deal with [[GPE]] to buy oil , gas and wheat .
birds of a feather …
my kid got ahold of [[CARDINAL]] of them [[NORP]] drones he was flying it with a radio controller and it crashed and burst into flames
the same drone [[GPE]] gave [[GPE]] to strike aramco on the dot ?
every dollar spent on arming [[GPE]] turns more [[NORP]] orcs into soil compost
[[GPE]] 's drone that has been so successful in [[GPE]] is outdated by drone standards i seriously doubt that anything [[GPE]] could produce will be that effective
will be funny when z gets taken out by an [[NORP]] weapon lol
[[PERSON]] is much more likely to be taken out by someone close to him .
will be funnier when [[PERSON]] is taken out by [[PERSON]] .
looking forward to it - his incessant whining is tiresome
not really vlad .
he s the [[NORP]] dem equivalent to [[ORG]] .... go post on [[ORG]] you [[NORP]] they love your insight there .
[[PERSON]] is the equivalent to [[ORG]] ? you are giving [[ORG]] too much credit . how ever [[PERSON]] 's morals are like a dog in heat .
no please try to keep up sparky ... z is like [[ORG]] all about twitter , and social media ....
in light of news about [[NORP]] drones . [[GPE]] has announced its sending counter unmanned air systems to [[GPE]] in aid of their defense . most likely this is to test out their systems against [[NORP]] systems , but a win win for [[GPE]] .
[[GPE]] should have stepped in long time ago .
i 've been waiting for [[GPE]] to step up to the plate .
they 've been a little busy keeping a leash on [[GPE]] 's nuclear development program . remember all those " mysterious " explosions and fires at all the [[NORP]] research centers ? but they 'll be helping [[GPE]] out now .
like many things the [[GPE]] war has been , it 's been one of the largest platforms of testing for modern weapons systems . drone warfare / tactics , social media warfare , aa systems testing , effectiveness of western weapons vs [[LANGUAGE]] . this war is a huge befit to outside countries in terms of the conduct of a modern war would look / behave like and everyone is taking their notes . those that can afford it also get good data to take back home sending equipment / weapons as well as brownie points .
it 's always the " small wars " with everyone testing their new " toys " that lead up to the big wars .
it 's not my government , i refuse to pay any kinds of taxes . i reject all foreign policies of government , i blame [[NORP]] and [[ORG]] , both sides are cowards . no money for health , borders , education , kids and elderly population . all money for aggressive , pathological policies . [[ORG]] approves [[MONEY]] in military aid to [[GPE]] [[ORG]] has approved a bill to provide [[GPE]] with [[MONEY]] in military aid , committee chairman [[PERSON]] said .ria news " spoil the weather " : [[GPE]] accused of violating the peace between [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] it is assumed that the funding will speed up the republic 's military reform and expand the training of the country 's military .
sounds like you should move out of the [[GPE]]
your future cowards we will see serious decline in [[GPE]] dollar once [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] announce the new alternative currency and make final all commodity trading be done in that new currency or home currency of [[GPE]] . the additionally hammer to [[GPE]] dollar will be opening of [[FAC]] where all gold sales and purchases will be physical and no paper and settled in [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] currencies . that will bust [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] and expose financial scam or marginal requirements and actual physical traded . the reason this affects [[GPE]] dollar significantly is all commodities , gold , silver and energy including oil is all done in [[GPE]] dollars . once you remove that . its lights out . ( and remember that the majority of commodities and precious metals are mined and produced in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
he lives in [[GPE]] . not from the [[GPE]] .
i 'm [[GPE]] taxpayer [[DATE]]
hey genius , you pay tax evertime you pay your utilities bill , buy gas , buy groceries . so settle down and stop puffin up [[PERSON]] .
it 's your future cowards we will see serious decline in [[GPE]] dollar once [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] announce the new alternative currency and make final all commodity trading be done in that new currency or home currency of [[GPE]] . the additionally hammer to [[GPE]] dollar will be opening of [[FAC]] where all gold sales and purchases will be physical and no paper and settled in [[PERSON]] or [[PERSON]] currencies . that will bust [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] and expose financial scam or marginal requirements and actual physical traded . the reason this affects [[GPE]] dollar significantly is all commodities , gold , silver and energy including oil is all done in [[GPE]] dollars . once you remove that . its lights out . ( and remember that the majority of commodities and precious metals are mined and produced in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
does anyone remember what happened the last time [[GPE]] formed an alliance with another rogue nation ? they lost [[CARDINAL]] of people . that was in [[DATE]] . history loves to repeat itself .
ya it was the [[GPE]] and we beat the [[NORP]] ... what the point of your wierd analogy ?
[[GPE]] entered into a pact with the [[NORP]] long before they requested to be part of the allied nations fighting the [[NORP]] .
and that 's exactly what i was talking about . the [[NORP]] lost over [[CARDINAL]] people when their " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " turned on them . rogue nations never seem to fair well when they make a pact together .
no fake vet it was n't long . it was [[DATE]] , boy . they just wanted [[GPE]] . when the nazis attacked them they became our allies .
you realize the [[GPE]] was by far the last country to enter into ww2 . my grandpa was a pow in a concentration camp , i ve had plenty of history lessons on ww2 . the bad guys were [[NORP]] and [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] ... all of which we now consider to be allies ... come on man
repeat the [[ORDINAL]] grade , please . if you ca n't understand the question , there 's no need to comment . it 's above your head .
aww precious , lowbrainpowerdad speaks and says ... nothing ! now run along , boy
it is you who needs a history lesson on who took [[GPE]] . ww2 was won by [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] working together . if the [[NORP]] did not fight the [[NORP]] the allies might not have won , the [[NORP]] ran out of resources fighting on both fronts and [[NORP]] did lose [[CARDINAL]] to defend .. same thing they will do in [[GPE]] if they need to .
yeah , let me know when the ayatollah orders a blitzkrieg on [[GPE]] .
surely [[GPE]] know those [[NORP]] drones fly better when the towel is unwrapped and removed from the front !
and , remember that is takes [[DATE]] for [[GPE]] to develop and make a drone . have you considered how that plays with all the money obama gave them [[DATE]] back ? and , remember the [[GPE]] drone that landed in [[GPE]] one time , intact . so obama also gave them the technology , probably even the phone numbers of the [[NORP]] companies to call to order parts .
an [[NORP]] drone is really just a [[DATE]] 's [[ORG]] hammered out into the shape of something that wants to fly .
fsb news , aka [[ORG]] , has put [[GPE]] 's rout of the [[NORP]] on the back burner . not that i 'm surprised ..
right ? biggest news story of [[DATE]] besides the [[PERSON]] 's passing and nothing about it on [[ORG]] . very strange [[PERSON]] love going on here .
obama gave [[GPE]] drone technology .
and the pallets of cash to the materials .
why else would he fly a [[GPE]] drone over [[NORP]] military air space ?
gee , i do n't know why anyone would fly a reconnaissance drone over an area they wanted to reconnoiter ...
sold ?
no , one crashed in the [[NORP]] desert .
build our arsenals now ! !
