[[GPE]] is being smart . running out of low - grade weapons , it 's using low grade weapons from [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] to sustain the attack on the [[GPE]] . saving their own better stuff .
.general kellogg and general [[PERSON]] are shills for the [[GPE]] defense industry . he is correct [[CARDINAL]] thing [[GPE]] has had a good couple of weeks . but do n't think that is the begining of the end . the counter offense in the north was accomplished by [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] troops trained by [[ORG]] in [[GPE]] , plus [[CARDINAL]] to [[CARDINAL]] mercenaries made up with many [[GPE]] , [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] contract fighters paid for by [[GPE]] with funds from [[GPE]] taxpayers . you would think with the recent success by [[GPE]] it would be perfect time to negotiate an end to conflict . but no , the escalation starts .
all this because [[PERSON]] refused to discuss [[ORG]] justified concerns with [[ORG]] expansion .
ww3 floating right under sleepy [[PERSON]] 's radar . god bless our youth .
i hear [[GPE]] may have some surplus supplies . maybe we could resupply our dwindling arms from them ?
they ran out of scud missiles
apparently , this [[GPE]] counteroffensive is n't as big of a " victory " as [[FAC]] and [[ORG]] hypes it to be . the recaptured areas had [[CARDINAL]] [[NORP]] troops consisting mostly of police units and reserve troops . they were pulled out immediately to save [[NORP]] from being captured or killed . they did leave their heavy equipment behind which the [[NORP]] use as props in their propaganda stunts which [[ORG]] eagerly eats up : " look , look , the [[NORP]] are blowing up [[NORP]] tanks . note that this [[GPE]] advance has stopped now that it ran into the real [[NORP]] defensive positions manned by regular troop . in [[DATE]] , the [[NORP]] will realize that they are trapped in a killing zone as the [[NORP]] counter offensive begins .
[[PERSON]] 's " " foolish political involvement with [[GPE]] to get votes .... is backfiring as it only positions [[GPE]] for more death and destruction ...... plus wasting [[GPE]] tax payers money ..... midterms ... will determine a '' new direction for this [[PERSON]] mess ......
i heard that [[NORP]] drones had a lot of issues just like the [[NORP]] military . i doubt that all have been solved
it took [[DATE]] of himars strikes to put potholes in the [[PERSON]] bridge . it took a single [[NORP]] precision missile strike on [[ORG]] to destroy the power plant , dam , bridge , and every ukr bridgehead on the [[NORP]] river . the city is flooded and scores of ukr troops are trapped on the east side and are currently being decimated . the [[NORP]] took out the electricity on [[DATE]] so that people would n't get electrocuted while wading through the floodwaters [[DATE]] .
the problem with [[NORP]] drones is that they have to stop flying [[CARDINAL]] times a day to pray towards [[GPE]] .
yeah you can tell by the way they crashed …
hence the reason the [[GPE]] should support [[GPE]] over [[GPE]] . even countries are known by the company they keep .
a [[ORG]] official , who remained anonymous , in [[DATE]] told [[ORG]] that some munition supplies have hit " uncomfortably low " levels . do n't shot all of your bullets thinking there 's only [[CARDINAL]] bad guy !
easy win for [[GPE]] weapons .
a laboratory for wwiii .
[[PERSON]] and his invasion are finished , sooner or later , [[GPE]] lost ..
so maybe the [[NORP]] actually got one of those drones made in [[GPE]] to work ? understood they were having problems with the drones not functioning right . quality control issues ? or design problems ? maybe operator error on the [[NORP]] end .
“ [[GPE]] has built up an arsenal of locally produced drones and exported drone technologies to its allies , enhancing [[GPE]] ’s ability to threaten the [[GPE]] and its [[NORP]] allies . from [[DATE]] to the present , [[GPE]] has continuously advanced its military [[ORG]] program , seeking to improve its fleets ’ intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance capabilities and to field [[ORG]] able to carry out airstrikes . in [[DATE]] , in particular , [[GPE]] has unveiled numerous new drone systems , many of which have been used in combat , demonstrating the advancements [[GPE]] has made in the [[ORG]] space . [[GPE]] now claims to have drones capable of delivering precision - guided missiles with ranges of 2000 km . , flight endurances over [[TIME]] , and stealth capabilities . while its boasts are often exaggerated for propagandistic purposes , the advancement of its drone program represents a technological triumph for [[GPE]] . ”
do n't knock [[NORP]] drones . they were designed on [[GPE]] technology from the ones the [[NORP]] captured from [[GPE]] .
that downed [[ORG]] looks like it was made by [[PERSON]] or sauder .
geeze , if the [[NORP]] sell off their stocks of munitions to the [[NORP]] , what will they have to defend themselves with eh ? nice that the [[NORP]] are providing all that nice flight signature data on the [[NORP]] drones , eh ?
drones built with obama pallet cash
mighty [[NORP]] war machine ...
too many [[NORP]] bots here . no real [[NORP]] is siding with the [[NORP]] on this one ... we prefer winners .
countries that oppress their people against countries who pretend they do n't .
so what ’s the point of this [[LAW]] shipped [[CARDINAL]] in weapons to [[GPE]] - so [[GPE]] bought a few [[NORP]] drones … …
the brit " intelligence " should find [[PERSON]] 's wmds [[ORDINAL]] .
[[GPE]] has gotten far more weaponry from the [[GPE]] and [[ORG]] .
what , from a sling shot ?
how sad does the [[NORP]] military have to be that they 're using [[NORP]] drones ? [[PRODUCT]] .
boring ... quit slacking off & play to win comrade .
so [[GPE]] is doing what [[GPE]] is doing . so what , it 's a war , have at it and may the best country win . not our problem .
why is [[ORG]] not covering how effectively [[GPE]] is regaining territory from [[GPE]] ?
is there any increase in the [[GPE]] production of our own weapons and ammo ?
well they did n't buy them to deliver pizzas
this might seem like a lot of money , but this was a very cost effective way to see and analyze [[NORP]] military tactics ( or lack ) ; study their weaponry ( not very good as it turns out ) ; analyze [[GPE]] 's command and control structure ( fatally flawed ) ; supply chain methodology and measure the political will of [[GPE]] . we got this for [[MONEY]] and did n't get any [[GPE]] military killed and ... helped save a country . money well spent i 'd say .
one can imagine the quality of weapons coming out of those [[CARDINAL]] .... holes .
more [[NORP]] troops have been defecting rather than fighting . [[PERSON]] has a horrible retention rate in this war . they even tried to pay [[NORP]] war criminals to be mercenaries and they preferred to stay in their home war zone . so yeah , he 's down to buying [[ORDINAL]] tier drones , not surprising . when he defaults on the nation 's next loan payments it will be the final nail in his coffin . may the god 's continue to bless [[GPE]] and the battle against fascism and dictators
defense contractors in [[DATE]] warned that sustaining [[GPE]] ’s war effort was depleting the weapon supplies the [[GPE]] had . keep shooting , we 'll make more .
will be interesting to see the [[NORP]] response .
[[GPE]] has to use [[NORP]] drones and [[ORG]] is worried about [[GPE]] attacking other member nation [[ORG]] ?
i would think they would be using the [[PERSON]] we left in [[GPE]] to use against us . been done many times before .
my kid got ahold of [[CARDINAL]] of them [[NORP]] drones he was flying it with a radio controller and it crashed and burst into flames
every dollar spent on arming [[GPE]] turns more [[NORP]] orcs into soil compost
[[GPE]] 's drone that has been so successful in [[GPE]] is outdated by drone standards i seriously doubt that anything [[GPE]] could produce will be that effective
will be funny when z gets taken out by an [[NORP]] weapon lol
in light of news about [[NORP]] drones . [[GPE]] has announced its sending counter unmanned air systems to [[GPE]] in aid of their defense . most likely this is to test out their systems against [[NORP]] systems , but a win win for [[GPE]] .
it 's not my government , i refuse to pay any kinds of taxes . i reject all foreign policies of government , i blame [[NORP]] and [[ORG]] , both sides are cowards . no money for health , borders , education , kids and elderly population . all money for aggressive , pathological policies . [[ORG]] approves [[MONEY]] in military aid to [[GPE]] [[ORG]] has approved a bill to provide [[GPE]] with [[MONEY]] in military aid , committee chairman [[PERSON]] said .ria news " spoil the weather " : [[GPE]] accused of violating the peace between [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] it is assumed that the funding will speed up the republic 's military reform and expand the training of the country 's military .
does anyone remember what happened the last time [[GPE]] formed an alliance with another rogue nation ? they lost [[CARDINAL]] of people . that was in [[DATE]] . history loves to repeat itself .
surely [[GPE]] know those [[NORP]] drones fly better when the towel is unwrapped and removed from the front !
and , remember that is takes [[DATE]] for [[GPE]] to develop and make a drone . have you considered how that plays with all the money obama gave them [[DATE]] back ? and , remember the [[GPE]] drone that landed in [[GPE]] one time , intact . so obama also gave them the technology , probably even the phone numbers of the [[NORP]] companies to call to order parts .
fsb news , aka [[ORG]] , has put [[GPE]] 's rout of the [[NORP]] on the back burner . not that i 'm surprised ..
obama gave [[GPE]] drone technology .
build our arsenals now ! !
