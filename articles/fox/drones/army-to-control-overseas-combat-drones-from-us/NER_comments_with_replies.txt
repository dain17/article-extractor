correction to the story , drones do n't have pilots . they have operators who think they are pilots .
i thought they were controlling drones in [[GPE]] from [[GPE]] [[DATE]] .
i think it 's kind of cool to see articles like this published , which contain [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] serious sounding quotes , but contain not [[CARDINAL]] iota of truth about the platform , mission , technology , or anything real . y'all have fun puffing yourselves up at the [[ORG]] club [[DATE]] .
another " couch warrior " pretending to know more than the rest of us .
wow , all that hate - surprise surprise - coming from people who do n't work for the company that manufactures the [[ORG]] , & who have n't been to the [[ORG]] 's & worked with the " pilots " there . ( for those of you who hate me for supposedly avoiding facts , they 're not known as pilots . ) i almost always know more than the rest of you .
amazing times we live in . if i can squeeze [[DATE]] out of my life i 'll be happy .
yeah and when the [[ORG]] 's take out all satellite capability we are right back where we started , so do n't count on this high flying expensive hardware when the real battles begin .
that 's a lot of ignorance ....
this is old news
not certain assets in theater will be enhanced by this process . sounds plausible but time will tell .
when they move to object based video compression they can drop bandwidth exponentially and improve the performance . place the a.i. in theater and transmit only the video meta data for initial analysis .
satellite dependency is not a great thing .
... [[CARDINAL]] pixels ( dots per square inch ) ... no , this is incorrect .
kind of like [[LOC]] .
they used this on the new series " [[PERSON]] [[PERSON]] " . a guy here in the [[GPE]] would get up every morning , go to work , where he would sit in a trailer and control a drone in [[LOC]] , often taking out whatever target was assigned him [[DATE]] .
as a millennial , i can tell you without a doubt that my generation will jump at the chance to get paid for basically playing a more productive and patriotic version [[PRODUCT]] - just make sure to include [[PERSON]] in the rations .
they may wear an [[ORG]] uniform .. but in fact many are [[ORG]] officers picking out the targets ..
why even get out of bed ?
in other news : your [[NORP]] overlords are controlling you from [[PERSON]] .
this was breaking news ... [[DATE]] .
the [[CARDINAL]] in [[CARDINAL]] resolution does not refer to " dots per square inch " and [[CARDINAL]] k is way [[CARDINAL]] pixels . should probably just say resolution has greatly improved if you are not fully briefed on the technological terms .
so who maintains them and where are they based ? i guess it does n't matter where the pilot is but people are still exposed to some degree .
drones do n't have pilots . they have operators ( who think they are pilots . )
predator drones .....
