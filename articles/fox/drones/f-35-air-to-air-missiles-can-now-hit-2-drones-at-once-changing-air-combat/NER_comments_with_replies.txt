you know what i love about our rail - gun technology , the ordnance do not have a heat trail to track ...
[[PRODUCT]] could simultaneously track and engage many more targets than that . [[CARDINAL]] is a friggin joke .
the ooda loop . most people take a minimum of [[TIME]] to process , then act . that 's way too slow to survive an agressor . training is paramount , be it a pilot or a self - defense situation ..
when i saw the story i knew i would find a nest of liberal , nattering nabobs of negativity . i was not disappointed .
picture does not include a [[PRODUCT]] or kc-135 or even a boom from any refueling aircraft . false caption .
it is hard to know what to make of these stories as the plane performance details and full weapon system capabilities are likely classified , for good reason . it does sound like the new software systems and sensors are more capable than previous [[GPE]] versions , but the key is staying ahead of potential adversaries . that is hard for the [[NORP]] public to judge when the details are classified , as they should be . in addition , no one fully knows a system 's effectiveness from its capabilities and also its faults until the system is under the pressure of the demanding and unforgiving environment of combat .
but its still a [[MONEY]] piece of junk that ca n't seem to stay flying for very long without major modifications or the piolet passing out due to ventilation / breathing problem 's its pure junk
all other things being equal , you use a [[MONEY]] missile to shoot down a [[MONEY]] drone , you still lose .
i wonder if we can keep this development from the [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] . we seem not to be able to stop hacking or selling out by our politicians seeking more power .
big deal .... fox love to promote tax spending insanity in the military ..... must get a commission
ok , this is good , but [[PRODUCT]] , [[PRODUCT]] , [[PRODUCT]] , [[PRODUCT]] , and [[PRODUCT]] already have this capability .
i think maybe the [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter and surely the [[ORDINAL]] generation fighter will by unmanned autonomous platforms capable of complete missions against multiple targets at extreme environmental conditions and stresses that manned platforms can not handle . our technological ability to complete them without human controllers onboard has been developed for quite awhile , only our confidence in the artificial intelligence allowing split [[ORDINAL]] decision making has been lacking .
never let the mugger know you have a gun . surprise them . the look on their face is priceless .
so when will we being transferring this technology to the [[NORP]] ?
each plane should carry a " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " insignia on it 's wings . amazing weapon .
can it take down the new ultra - sonic weapons that [[GPE]] has produced ?
this is good . but i still do n't think we can afford the full [[CARDINAL]] or more that they wanted .
hummm
[[GPE]] has more nukes then [[GPE]] , end of story .
this is great . but what happens when the enemy takes out our satellites . cause any fool knows that 's the first thing to happen if a shooting war breaks out .
wonder why we always announce the development of a new system and show pictures of it to the world . if we were smart and if i was king of the world , the soonest an adversary would know of the latest weapon i developed would be when it blasted him into neverland .
it wo n't take long for [[GPE]] to sell that technology to [[GPE]] .
why not publish this straight up in [[NORP]] ?
the pilot should use keyboard shortcuts to be more effective .
i suppose that by now with our porous leak prone government , the [[NORP]] people are the last to learn about this , with the [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] probably already having the plans for the system in hand ... or computer . but would n't a new weapons system be more effective if the enemy did n't know what it does ? would n't they be less likely to develop a similar system if they did n't know for sure that it would work ?
seems like nothing to brag over [[DATE]] , [[PRODUCT]] an / awg-9 radar offers a variety of air - to - air modes including long - range continuous - wave radar velocity search , range - while - search at shorter ranges , and the [[ORDINAL]] use of an airborne track - while - scan mode with the ability to track up to [[CARDINAL]] airborne targets , display [[CARDINAL]] of them on the cockpit displays , and launch against [[CARDINAL]] of them at the same time . this function was originally designed to allow the [[ORG]] to shoot down formations of bombers at long range . ( per [[ORG]] . ) this radar was designed to work aim-54 [[GPE]] which had range or [[QUANTITY]] and [[PERSON]] 5 speed .
i hope they 'll keep the design in a safe place far from [[NORP]] thieves .
i think somebody needs to go back and look what the f 14 tomcat was capable of before bragging about shooting down [[CARDINAL]] targets at once .
i m not sure what this article is crowing about . the fact that an [[PERSON]] missle , which has been in service since [[DATE]] , was able to hit targets ( like its been doing for [[DATE]] ) , or the fact that the [[ORG]] was the delivery vehicle that carried them ... [[ORG]] : impressive aircraft . great tech . very pricey . would have preferred to buy [[CARDINAL]] , maybe [[CARDINAL]] f15es for that same cost as one [[ORG]] -but that s just me ..
while working on the integrated weapons team at [[ORG]] . we shot down [[CARDINAL]] targets , at [[CARDINAL]] time , with [[GPE]] missles launched from an f14a in [[DATE]] . the [[NORP]] cost [[MONEY]] each back then .
my only concern is there is now so much more that can go wrong with these planes , similar to when they started adding all these electrical and computer gadgets to cars . when i owned my vega , showing my age , not much could go wrong because there was nothing in the car .
where are the laser weapons ? we should have them by now
drones are [[CARDINAL]] thing but missiles traveling at hyper velocity are another . [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] supposedly are testing their own . we have our own program but are lagging behind in that technology . after the veiled threats [[GPE]] 's military made about sinking [[CARDINAL]] or [[CARDINAL]] of our carriers , i 'd be a little worried .
i 'll bet in real time it 's capable of shooting down at the same the total armament it 's able to load .
this tech is mind blowing !
the headline implied that a single missile was used to hit [[CARDINAL]] drones . clickbait at it 's best .
holy crap ! !
heh , heh . cool . heh , heh .
probably do have them . can not publicize everythin to the public . i wish they could .
these are cooler and more impressive than words ! unlike past presidents , let 's hope [[PERSON]] keeps playing tough on keeping / minimizing the vile cheating [[NORP]] from stealing these technologies ...
soon china will try to copy but they will get the success upto wall - mart shelves for users [[DATE]] .
obama just took credit for this as well .
drones are n't shooting back or evading and they are alone without a wingman or other supporting aircraft .
if only scientists would isolate the liberal gene , and remove it , humankind could be saved from extinction .
wow ... we're still wasting money on trying to justify the billions that have been or will be spent on this malfunctioning money hole ? wow ... this [[MONEY]] beast can take out [[CARDINAL]] drones at once - yep , it 's totally worth [[DATE]] of development and 10s of [[CARDINAL]] wasted so far to create a multi - malfunctioning machine one more wow - the helmet worn by pilots costs $ 300,000 to $ [[MONEY]] each - a real bargain ...
it 's the next thing on [[GPE]] 's list to steal .
why are socialist here if they do n't like this country move the hell out period
is this money pit immune to all sams ?
the [[NORP]] or the [[NORP]] do n't mind spending money to bury you !
so , the war in [[GPE]] should only last another , what , [[DATE]] , [[DATE]] ? what ? tell us how we get our money out of this .
i 'm not gon na lie , that picture makes me hard to be an [[NORP]] ... truth !
how much did that cost ? like a trillion dollars ? or [[CARDINAL]] ? who 's counting huh ...
[[ORG]] has [[CARDINAL]] military preparedness stories on their front page . wonder what they are up to ?
enemies of america take notes ; do n't mess with the [[GPE]]
a money pit with wings , for the price it should take out [[CARDINAL]] drones at once and fly itself
this is great news if it means we could liquidate putin and [[PERSON]] simultaneously .....
[[GPE]] , are you paying attention ?
[[PERSON]] suggests replacing the [[FAC]] with a botanical garden . we 'll toss bouquets at our enemies and win their hearts .
we should have stuck with the [[PRODUCT]] . i 've talked to pilots of both and the raptor is simply unmatched . [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] bowed to lobbyists to kill the most advanced fighter in the world . now , all of a sudden , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] are catching up per [[ORG]] .
only downside to this , is the army is retiring the a-10 for this . its far superior i know but the low and slow [[PRODUCT]] and it 's [[QUANTITY]] cannon sure was awesome , only plane built around a gun . gun is so powerful if not shot in bursts can actually stop the plane in flight now that 's a gun
good . time to take out those pesky [[NORP]] and [[NORP]] fighters .
lol ! yesss !
why do we constantly tell our enemies what our weapons are capable of doing ?
i want lasers . now !
that 's a lot of acronyms and initialisms ....
if i ever see [[CARDINAL]] of drones over my yard i will send a [[MONEY]] .22 to take it down .
where are all the [[NORP]] to tell us this is a waste of money
i thought my ride in an [[PERSON]] was just amazing , could n't imagine what the 35 would be like .
an [[PRODUCT]] shot 4 qf-105 drones out of the sky using [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] [[CARDINAL]] [[ORG]] missiles simultaneously in the mid 80 's at [[FAC]] . so how is this a game changer that [[PRODUCT]] the job [[DATE]] ? oh and the missile used could not have been an aim-9 , that 's a sidewinder .
[[ORG]] news , the new [[ORG]] leakers
[[ORG]] is a beast . too many details in this article . nice work , now the enemies have detailed specifics .
scary how advanced weaponry is becoming , ... because they 're trying to disarm us as they get upgrades .
“ the most surreal was taking the jet into the climatic chamber and freezing it down to [[CARDINAL]] below and baking it up to [[QUANTITY]] [[ORG]] … ” next thing you will be publishing blueprints .
so do we have any [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , or [[NORP]] immigrants working on this project ?
who here actually believes the arms race ever took a detour ... difference is , now , we 're funding the military .
[[ORG]]
best damn technology ever . best damn military ever . best damn country ever .
one word " bandersnatch "
the drones had [[PERSON]] 's face painted on it though .
[[GPE]] had just fired its hypersonic ‘ avangard ’ ballistic guided missile system . and everything seemed to work fine . [[PERSON]] declared [[GPE]] to be “ untouchable ” as no other nation had such “ invincible ” nuclear - capable missiles can skip through the upper atmosphere at [[CARDINAL]] times faster than the speed of sound . no defense system exists that can track it fast enough , react fast enough or hit it fast enough to prevent it reaching its target . [[GPE]] hypersonic missile scientists arrested , accused of treason
too little for too much money . how long until [[GPE]] has [[CARDINAL]] drones that can out perform ?
cool !
how advanced are [[GPE]] 's drones ? oh yeah , they control the market . and their dji ( the best ) drones control like [[CARDINAL]] of it . ..... so you know who we would be likely to be fighting in this scenario .
the [[ORG]] probably already stole the technology due to our lax immigration system .
cue the [[NORP]] agents attacking the [[ORG]] 's effectiveness ....
nobody has actualy seen these plane 's fly but of course fox and the milloterry keep printing these artacle 's
come get ya some ! we are still the best military in the world . sidenote , my brother is getting ready to load up his platoon [[DATE]] on the train . they are getting ready to head to [[GPE]] .
good job raytheon !
why does the world need to know all our military secrets ? maybe that 's the problem when hiring unqualified , never served civilians to be our elected representatives and run our government .
[[PERSON]] invented [[CARDINAL]] g ’s
the [[NORP]] already stole the technology and are manufacturing their knockoffs as we speak . we just ca n’t keep secrets .
it was the same in the early 90 's - we get told of technology advancements [[DATE]] after the fact ....
" when a single [[PRODUCT]] used sensors , onboard computers and targeting systems to find , track and destroy [[CARDINAL]] airborne drones at the same time with air - to - air missiles , the emerging [[ORDINAL]] gen fighter transitioned into a new era for offensive attack missions . " great pr but why not tell the public the real truth ...... these planes can track multiple ground targets , air targets and receive and send real time data / video back to command for decisions the human pilot does not have to make . this article insults those who know the truth .
so . . . how well does this optical system work in ifr conditions ?
[[PERSON]] would accuse you of warming the planet if you used too much hot sauce . drones ? oh , right ! !
a cheap drone costs $ [[MONEY]] maybe a more expensive one that has some offensive capability ~$20,000 . what does the [[PERSON]] cost ?
at first i thought it was " clones " and i wondered if [[PERSON]] would be going down soon .
my " [[PERSON]] " rc plane does [[CARDINAL]] g 's .
but will they stand up against these so - called [[ORG]] cruise missile threats that we 've been reading about ?
here is the [[PERSON]] folks . i had a military circuit board account that i had chemical processes for building multi layer high reliable circuit boards for on board avionics . they had invited [[NORP]] [[NORP]] nationalist engineers to their plant in [[GPE]] to learn how to build these military circuit boards . that was on [[PERSON]] [[CARDINAL]] 's watch folks . yes ! it is true store .
the [[NORP]] spend a lot of time attacking the [[ORG]] program . a lot of time . that makes me happy .
bring it on china ! ! ! !
[[NORP]] agents are robbing our military contractors blind . they have infiltrated into [[GPE]] . [[DATE]] .
game changer . [[CARDINAL]] hell of an engineering achievement . worth [[MONEY]] if it keeps [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] at bay .
the [[NORP]] have a sharing radar system between ther mig [[CARDINAL]] and mig 31 planes . they fly [[CARDINAL]] at a time and all their radars share information and so [[CARDINAL]] plane can track multiple targets at once . they have had this for [[DATE]] .
[[PRODUCT]] equipped with the aug9 system and [[GPE]] missiles could target [[CARDINAL]] targets simultaneously back in the [[DATE]] 's . i 'm not sure how the [[PRODUCT]] only being able to hit [[CARDINAL]] simultaneously is such a milestone .
sigh ... it 's been done before and should of been easy to do for this fighter right off the bat . pheonix missiles used to be able to be pickled off [[CARDINAL]] at a time to attack multiple targets at once under the right circumstances but due to the speed of the missile , [[CARDINAL]] - 4 could usually be in the air at once . that was with [[DATE]] 's tech . with the [[GPE]] , they were able to fire [[CARDINAL]] - 3 missiles ( rated for [[CARDINAL]] targets at once but the speed of missiles limited the number in the air due to repositioning because of limits to the angles of attack the lower generations of missiles had ) at separate targets with the testing gear though it was never implemented in the early [[DATE]] 's off of [[PRODUCT]] 's because the military considered it " wasteful " in their push for " assymmetrical " " warfare as large scale combat was deemed low risk .
we have the greatest military the world has ever seen . that 's why the enemy has infiltrated our gov't . looking at you , dims .
and what you are reading is the unclassified version ...
too bad all this technology will go to waste when [[PERSON]] shuts the [[GPE]] military down to pay for abortions and free liquor and rent for everyone . maybe we can sell it to pay for more people to get free diapers and make ms. [[PERSON]] happy
uh .... this is nothing new . f-15c 's with pulse dopplar can track and engage more than one target at a time . so can [[GPE]] ....
all [[ORDINAL]] and [[ORDINAL]] generation jet fighters can do this what s the hubbub
only medium range , [[PERSON]] ... [[PRODUCT]] with [[CARDINAL]] [[FAC]] shot down [[CARDINAL]] targets . the [[GPE]] can lock on at [[QUANTITY]] . no medium range , no dog fighting needed = no harm to out pilots .
our enemies ca n’t kick our door in and beat us that ’s why they teamed up with the libbies .
they 'll need to hit [[CARDINAL]] at the same time . drones are so much cheaper to mass produce , can fly in ways that would kill a human , and are evolving far faster than the flying dinosaurs .
am i supposed to be impressed with [[ORG]] generated articles ? this reads like a translation out of [[LANGUAGE]] into [[NORP]] and back again . the headline was impressive .
hmm and all you have to do is jam that ability .
actually that is old technology . the mig 25 had a private network that enabled it to launch missiles against aircraft targeted by a different [[ORG]] . it could target [[CARDINAL]] aircraft simultaneously . [[PRODUCT]] had a similar system .
great , [[MONEY]] missiles taking out [[CARDINAL]] k dollar drones .
its not official until the [[NORP]] combat test it for us .
seeing an f-35a lightning ii aircraft with an [[NORP]] flag visible in the window should give every citizen a woody ! [[GPE]] ! [[GPE]] ! [[GPE]] !
all of the taxes you will ever pay in our entire life wo n't even pay for the landing gear for one of these .
" file photo - f-35a lightning ii aircraft receive fuel from [[PRODUCT]] from [[FAC]] , [[GPE]] , [[DATE]] , during a flight from [[GPE]] to the [[GPE]] ( [[ORG]] photo / staff [[PERSON]] . [[PERSON]] ) " umm , no , it 's not .
on a more serious note , can these [[PERSON]] 's use photon [[PERSON]] 's or is that just a vicious rumour ?
bring it on and beyond ! ! 😁 [[PERSON]] 😎
very old concept , modified to use more capable weapons . [[PERSON]] used cameras with long range optics to identify targets , and could engaged up to [[CARDINAL]] enemy aircraft simultaneously while keeping their radars turned off so the enemy would n't even know they were around . sadly the [[GPE]] missile , while great at long range engagement well out of the range of enemy missiles of the time , was not much good against lighter fighters due to limited maneuverability .
great
lets hope they 've fixed the aim-9x so it does n't get fooled by [[DATE]] 's era [[NORP]] countermeasures / flares ? !
so it fired [[CARDINAL]] missiles at [[CARDINAL]] different targets at the same time ? could n't the [[PRODUCT]] do that back in the 70s ? i assumed every fighter jet designed since [[PRODUCT]] had that capability too . and most of them carry more than just [[CARDINAL]] air - to - air missiles .
[[CARDINAL]] lines of code .
an f14 could do that in the [[DATE]] 's and a f18 could do multiple so this is no big deal . the major drawback of the f35 it 's only a single engine plane . if it had dual be a much much better fighter .
need start up full rate production of new a [[CARDINAL]] 's .
that same technology can be used on the [[PRODUCT]] which is a far less expensive platform to acquire and maintain .
please just build a wall and then defend it . fix the visa overstay problem . export illegals and then watch wages rise !
more f-22s please .
* yawn * the [[GPE]] missile system did [[DATE]] , and wore it better too .
newly elected [[ORG]] will demand all aircraft , submarines and aircraft carriers be powered by solar energy by [[DATE]] .
do the [[NORP]] have this technology , or did they steal it ?
why are our stupid military commanders and journalists telling the world what our fighter jets can and can not do ? court - martial these fools !
[[CARDINAL]] drones at once ? so ... one of these things can take out [[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] simultaneously ?
ca n't wait until lasers are perfected . we are close .
" he who sees [[ORDINAL]] has [[CARDINAL]] the battle . " ~ [[PERSON]] , top ace of [[EVENT]] .
something else besides just being [[CARDINAL]] targets has to be what 's special about this . [[PRODUCT]] demonstrated [[CARDINAL]] simultaneous aim-54 [[GPE]] kills ( against drones ) [[DATE]] . maybe it was all passive or just that this is the [[ORDINAL]] time that an [[PRODUCT]] did it ?
few [[NORP]] have any idea at what these aircraft are capable of . ask any aerospace engineering professional , and you 'll see how incredibly advanced these crucial aircraft have become .
