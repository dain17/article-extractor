With the AAMRAM, they were able to fire 2-3 missiles (rated for 5 targets at once but the speed of missiles limited the number in the air due to repositioning because of limits to the angles of attack the lower generations of missiles had) at separate targets with the testing gear though it was never implemented in the early 2000's off of F-16's because the military considered it \"wasteful\" in their push for \"assymmetrical\"\" warfare as large scale combat was deemed low risk.",
