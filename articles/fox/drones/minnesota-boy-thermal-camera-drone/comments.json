Many people live in “safe” communities where neighbors look out for each other.  I do. It is always sad to see neighborhoods where parents must fear to be more than a few feet from their children, or keep them in locked houses all day because of safety.  That doesn’t mean parents should be unaware of their children’s location. \n\nKids need to be able to “run and play” to build strength and mental agility.  This kid just got lost.  A GPS locator is called for on most kids like that. Loyal dogs are often a good idea.  We had one that stopped unauthorized adults from coming near the children. The kids loved him. Thank goodness for his dog.",

In fact, God given.  \n\nEven like the GPS locator.  Great idea!  \n\nNo animal, child or adult should ever have to fear and be locked in.  However, reality is, parenting is more than giving birth and letting them run wild and not pay attention to their whereabouts.  Granted, we can all get lost (no matter the age).  Therefore, even more important that the parenting skills be in place to be able to assist in an emergency.  Forget the outside concern of mankind, but include mother nature issues such as holes, sprains, tangled in brush etc.  Children require supervision.  Supervision is the parents responsibility.  \n\nNow, add the financial resources expended by the community.  Yes, 600 volunteers working together...beautiful community and unity.  However, not always the case.  First responders who may have aided elderly folks but were spending their time walking around looking for this child.  An elderly family member that may need assistance, but everyone took off to look for the kid that the parents lost sight of during the day...I question several decisions on behalf of the parents parental skills.\n\nWhen the child does grow up and relocates or travels, that support system may not exist for him outside the community.  Will he be equipped with the necessary skills or will he think back and believe...  oh, someone will take care of me.",

I need an animal strong enough to pull sleds and find bombs and yet gentle enough to love babies, find the lost, lead the blind and help a soldier forget the horror of war. An animal that will spend all day on a couch with a resting head and supportive eyes for the broken heart.\n\nSo God made a Dog.\n\nIt had to be an animal who would remain patient and loyal even through loneliness. An animal who would bring the family together with an open heart. An animal to bark, and then pant and then reply with the rapid wag of a tail, when their best friend says, “let’s go for a ride in the car.”\n\nSo God made a Dog.\n\nGod said I need an animal who would stand at your side when the world around you collapses. An animal to lie next to you during the long nights of pain and sorrow when it hurts to move, to talk, or think, or even be. An animal to give you strength when you have none of your own. An animal to fight when you have no fight left, to hold onto your soul to keep you in this world. An animal to be your companion and guide in this world and the next. An animal to wait for you on the other side or stand guard in your absence until they can join you for eternity.\n\nSo God made a Dog.",
