hero involves great sacrifice . good deed , good man sure . hero , like he said no . this was once normal behavior .
aww the dog is a [[PERSON]] spaniel .
[[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] - [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] -- thank you
do you know where your kids are ?
[[ORG]] ! ! ! !
your dog will be your best friend and loyal to you until the end ! i 'm very happy little [[PERSON]] had his best friend , [[ORG]] , with him !
good thing pup kept him warm ! ! !
wow
after this story broke [[DATE]] [[TIME]] , i had to google wednesday morning , to find out they were found and where [[ORG]] !
and on [[DATE]] god looked down on his wide eyed children and decided , they need a companion . so god made a dog . god said i need an animal who no matter what you did n’t do or could n’t take or did n’t win or could n’t make , will love you without judgment just the same . i need an animal strong enough to pull sleds and find bombs and yet gentle enough to love babies , find the lost , lead the blind and help a soldier forget the horror of war . an animal that will spend [[DATE]] on a couch with a resting head and supportive eyes for the broken heart . so god made a dog . it had to be an animal who would remain patient and loyal even through loneliness . an animal who would bring the family together with an open heart . an animal to bark , and then pant and then reply with the rapid wag of a tail , when their best friend says , “ let ’s go for a ride in the car . ” so god made a dog . god said i need an animal who would stand at your side when the world around you collapses . an animal to lie next to you during the long nights of pain and sorrow when it hurts to move , to talk , or think , or even be . an animal to give you strength when you have none of your own . an animal to fight when you have no fight left , to hold onto your soul to keep you in this world . an animal to be your companion and guide in this world and the next . an animal to wait for you on the other side or stand guard in your absence until they can join you for eternity . so god made a dog .
absolutely beautiful . i have always trusted my dogs instincts over a human being . there is [[CARDINAL]] exception ; my late husband . god bless ...
i remember a man saying something just like this almost but i ca n't remember his name ! i am 61 yrs old and i have always had a dog ever since i could remember , sometimes we had 2 dogs like i do now . i have cats to and love them but i really love my dogs !
[[PERSON]] invented happy endings ...
thank you [[PERSON]] for staying with your best bud .
that 's what i thought , too . best friends for life . :)
absolutely . not to mention a great name for a dog . this family is my kinda people .
i agree ! !
good job mr fines !
why is the dad and the boy bare foot the the nitwitter video ?
who cares ! just you i guess .
is that all you took away from this ? ? lol ! !
dogs and drones , lifesavers !
so happy they were found !
great ending ! [[ORG]] deserves some extra treats for staying with his pal .
good there was n't social media involved in this story .
always good news when little ones are found safe !
what a great story and what a great effort by the community . the loyalty of a family pet is an amazing thing
nice to hear some stories with a great ending for a change !
wonder full story ! but why was n't there someone waiting to pick him up ?
this best result is great . he was into a one dog night for sure . savor the moment folks the statistics on this are horrible . i would like to think some friendships have blossomed because of this .
why did n't the dog take him out of the field and back home ?
i imagine it got hungry and wanted to . pack mentality kept it close .
such great news ! thank you , lord !
thank you , good samaritan with a thermal seeking drone
best story of [[DATE]] .
a++++++++++++ !
thank you god and thank you ' village ' ! !
they would have found him a harvest time anyway .
" lassie go home girl ! call 911 and tell ma and pa i fell in a well ! "
if not [[DATE]] then definitely next .
you hooked one .
yes , but the outcome might not have been very good . corn combines can be dangerous to get caught up in if the child is not in the row right in front of the operator . he could have been seriously maimed or even killed ! ( i grew up on a farm and know about these things ! )
naughty boy . it 's going to happened again .
it does n't normally . kids who wander off at that age learn from being afraid and alone in the dark .
thanks for your opinion dolly [[PERSON]] . are you ever happy about anything ?
happy they found the little guy :)
cute little tyke , awesome story , thank god for all those that searched and found them safe .
yes ! bet mom meets that bus until he graduates from now on .
what awesome news . glad he was found ok and happy he had his dog with him .
good dog . kept [[PERSON]] warm
what a great story to help my heart after all of the other awful news ..... a boy and his dog , there are few couples that can beat that !
amazing that thermal cameras have dropped so much in price that ordinary people can afford them for their drones .
makes you wonder why the fire department did n't have [[CARDINAL]] .
budget issues ? [[ORG]] said , " if not for that drone , i 'm not sure we would have found him . " a state patrol helicopter and another thermal imaging drone from [[ORG]] were also used in the search .
typical small town .... everyone rallies to help those in need .... our big cities need to adapt more of that attitude .... ' me [[ORDINAL]] , others [[ORDINAL]] ' .... great encouraging story ! ! !
in a modern town , [[ORG]] would be arguing on how many people from each race should be put on the rescue team ?
lol !
great job by all ..... also , there 's nothing like a good dog ! ! !
best story on fox [[DATE]] . so happy he was found safe . god bless everyone involved .
gack ! shades of [[PERSON]] tall grass story ! ! ! !
i 'm just glad it did n't end with something from the lawnmower man ...
great story ! !
the dog had the look on its face that said ' there was nothing to worry about . the kid was with me . we knew you 'd find us . ' .
dogs are the best !
amen ! ca n't see a furry feline doing the same thing ..... a cat would take off to find a mouse !
and a cat would n’t share .
i needed that , thank you . glad they are safe .
[[ORG]] ..... thanks for sharing a story with a happy ending .......... :) .
lots of people lost in cornfields were found way before there were ever drones . drama queens .
nice ! ! drone would also come in handy during hunting season ...
great news . that drone with the heat imaging camera is awesome .
i am surprised it worked if there were that many searchers in the area .
maybe it was the position and it was n't moving ? ?
" [[ORG]] him to the cornfield ! "
read this story [[DATE]] before they found him , and my heart sank . awesome job by all who helped and thanks and praise be to god for the positive outcome .
the kid must have watched [[ORG]] 's in the tall grass .
that 's very cool tech . happy outcome .
nice ..
lassie would have shown the kid the way out of the corn field
but he / she would have demanded more than union wages !
this could be a brand new game . release kids in cornfields and contestants with drones compete for prizes as they find them .
well , that over time would just morph into the ol' " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " scenario , would n't it ? lol !
thank god ! some good news !
thank you to [[PERSON]] for saving [[CARDINAL]] lives that day ! you are a hero .
the kid is only six years old and they let him get off a bus by himself out in the country near a cornfield without any adults watching him ? ? ?
he got off the bus with his siblings ....
seems like you have never been to the [[NORP]] [[LOC]]
yes . it 's called living a normal life in [[GPE]] .
children of the [[PERSON]] .. ?
thank god for drones .
police departments would love to have this technology , but unfortunately liberals do n't want the police to have it and wo n't allow them to purchase them . just think of the time saved in searching for missing individuals , if the police , upon learning of a missing child , could have this in the sky looking , while search parties are being formed . it would allow officers to search trended in yards instead of having to enter yards and get bit by dogs . also saving on manpower needed to search .
finally a feel good story ..
extra help in finding someone - a drone with heat - seeking technology . volunteers are great !
thank god !
and the drone operator
god can use people who are willing and available ... not everything has to be a lightning bolt from above ... sometimes it 's a drone .
what about the dog ? he is a hero too !
how come mom or [[PERSON]] was n't at the bus stop .. ?
sounds like the bus stopped in front of their house , which explains [[ORG]] being there waiting .
really ............
he got off the bus with his siblings . i 'm sure it 's a [[DATE]] routine ...
he probably got off the bus at the end of his driveway .
and people believe that [[PERSON]] exists ? drone can spot a [[DATE]] boy with an [[ORG]] camera , but not a [[QUANTITY]] tall primate ? lol ...
[[NORP]] job in finding [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] . is n't modern technology wonderful when good things like this happen ! ! ! god bless all who worked to find them .
i needed this [[DATE]] ! hallelujah ! great job volunteers , that is what community is all about !
" so i told corn pop ; if you do nt help that kid get out of the corn field , you ai nt getting the money ! and son of a scarecrow ! ! ! the kid got out ! - [[PERSON]]
do you require a welfare check ?
probably for [[MONEY]] pr [[MONEY]] ... to cover party expenses .
i meant the type of welfare check where the cops stop by to check your " condition " .
ca n't you give politics a rest for [[TIME]] ?
finally , some good news .
good . dogs surely do define loyalty .
why do n't the police and such have this tech ? it is about time that they do . it is cheaper than the overtime pay and better equipped to handle such emergencies .
they do have it . the story mentions state patrol helicopter and another police drone were involved in the search .
if you read the article it says that the police dept also had a drone with thermal imaging in the air ...
it saved a young boys life .
they are not search and rescue .
perhaps in small communities police and search and rescue are combined .
i think many police departments do have drones .
because cities and localities do n’t support their police departments , for one . where does all the money go ?
been there done that and got a whuppin for it !
great news .
best story of [[DATE]] . god bless all the searchers especially the drone owner .
so wonderful they found this little one alive . things like this are so much more important that politics .
that ’s a good story .
there is more to this story that is not being told . many times these are autistic children that hide to keep out of sight of the searchers . why was this boy missing ? maybe someone was suppose to be watching him and did n't ?
for crying out loud , the world has turned so negative that enjoying a heart warming story is not allowed ?
go to disneyland if you have to have a happy ending . [[DATE]] in the mountains of [[GPE]] , a family with [[DATE]] boy were camping . on the way back to camp from the lake he took off a different direction . there were about 500 responders looking for him for [[DATE]] . he was finally coaxed - out of the trees [[QUANTITY]] from camp . he had been hiding the whole time even when responders were just feet from his location . the police and his family failed to mentioned his condition and that he would hide on purpose . it was nice that he was found but it sure left a sour taste in all our mouths .
i know the world is far from perfect and i certainly do n't know the whole story but i i am sorry for what your search team went through . however , what part of this little boy 's missing was his fault ?
i understand . i 'm not blaming the child and i 'm not blaming this child . i 'm saying the family needs to release this kind of information to the search responders . this search seems similar to the [[GPE]] one . it might make it easier and faster to locate the child .
i totally agree . have [[DATE]] .
happiest story ever . ! ! ! ! so glad he was found and great work by drone guy and rest of this community .
glad to see a responsible drone operator using it for good ! drones are excellent tools if used properly - ie : below [[CARDINAL]] ft and nowhere near an airport or congested flight zones .
scary thing is when people start using drones for bad things like the mass shooters .
i agree .
his dog acted as his guardian angel .
my dog would have abandoned me then return to eat me when he got hungry .
what a wonderful story , so happy for this little guy , his adorable dog and his family .
just made me think of that [[ORG]] episode . send him to the cornfields became literal this time .
sometimes the good guys win . good job finding this child and his faithful companion .
great . now recall [[PERSON]] .
ca n't you go [[TIME]] without inserting politics into a decent story ?
science , yo
[[ORG]] are [[ORG]]
thermal cameras do n't work in [[GPE]] .....
everyone 's cold - blooded ? ?
the heat bro , the heat !
tough kid , and cute .
an awesome use for this type of drone . i ’m so glad they found him ! wonderful news .
what a good dog , [[ORG]] . he stayed faithfully with his person . dogs are a gift from god and could teach us humans a thing or [[CARDINAL]] .
humans bred dogs to be loyal . give humans some credit .
if you are learning from your dog , you might have a disability to deal with .
give that dog a treat . it probably helped keep the boy warm .
thank you [[PERSON]] for inventing drones .
lol
a little tiny gps tracker on the dogs collar would have made this a non issue . they are literally the size of a quarter , and you can track / find it with your phone ........
anyone can track you with those . i value privacy over safety , [[DATE]] long . who know who could come for you .
great seeing a community pull together when someone is in need . not as common as it used to be , at least in [[GPE]] .
i am so glad the [[CARDINAL]] are safe ! ! !
cuddos to the drone flyer !
truly a heart - warming story ! so glad both were found alive and safe ! god bless you , son !
nice to see some news with a happy ending for a change ....
affordable drones for the masses have been changing the world for the better since they [[ORDINAL]] came out .
so , we know he 's going to be a camper :) glad they found him !
thankful the child and his dog were found safe and are now back home . it 's such a dangerous world anymore and even in isolated places , so this little guy is so lucky ( or his guardian angel was watching over him ) no one evil intercepted him . parents need to ensure this does n't happen again , with him , or any of their other children .
that 's cool .
love this happy ending !
bad boy , great dog 👍 🏼
really ? i bet you 're one of those people who tell a young child if they do n't behave well the police man " will come and take you away " .
sweet ! !
just my word at the end of this story .
dog kept him warm !
they did n't have a helicopter with thermal camera ?
" a state patrol helicopter and another thermal imaging drone from [[ORG]] were also used in the search . " i guess you did n't actually read the story .
i did read it . the helicopter did n't have thermal . right ?
helicopter has thermal . but , was probably searching another portion of the grid .
probably a little hard to come by . drones are everywhere .
and less expensive " manpower " ...
you mean a heart warming story and [[ORG]] has n't denied comments , what 's up with that ? god bless those who went on the search and helped rescue these [[CARDINAL]] young pups !
so , for all those who 've been paranoid about hobbyist drone ( [[ORG]] - unmanned [[ORG]] ) operating in / around your neighborhoods , cut them some slack ... they do more good than you 'll ever know .
very cool . good dog , too .
thank god for a good ending to this story ! !
it 's good to see a community outpouring to help find a child ! this is what [[GPE]] is all about !
good job by all including the dog .
:)
thanks to all who looked for him and to remington for staying with him ! good story to start [[DATE]] !
yes !
the dog is the real hero who stayed with that kid and kept him warm .
way to go ........ great news !
great news !
finally a positive story about what a drone equipped with a flir camera can do .
thank you jesus ! so happy this story ended with good news , god bless that community and mr. [[PERSON]] , for his fine work !
brittany , a great bird - dog . methinks it 's no accident the dog 's name is [[ORG]] .
perhaps they felt " [[ORG]] " sounded a bit tedious .
parents should buy gps devices for their children to wear ! it 's available .
a cell phone with a tracking app provides that .
but gps devices can be pinned on a little kid and easy to use
find a kid with a phone [[DATE]] that does n't take it with them . if you merely pin something to a child it 's basically forcing them to wear it and would be something bullies would [[CARDINAL]] in on like bees to honey . but a phone is something more and more kids are getting at younger and younger ages . aside from that , moving all their expensive school books to a tablet which could also have gps would not only also get the children less to carry around but by allowing some games on the devices ( locked out during school and parent defined [[TIME]] ) would also give them a reason to keep the device with them . so a phone itself is only one item that could be used to assist .
too bad we do n't have the boy scouts around anymore to teach kids how to use a compass and whatnot .
[[DATE]] ? he would have been maybe been working on his [[ORG]] badge in [[ORG]] . i was in [[ORG]] and boy scouts and we did n't do any orientation with a compass until [[ORG]] .
they still have the boy scouts but now they teach [[PERSON]] and interior design .
a [[DATE]] ran off to play with his dog and got lost in a cornfield ... and you are talking about compass use ?
if you want to praise technology , praise the thermal imaging camera ... a thousand drones or [[CARDINAL]] searchers in hot air balloons would not have found him without thermal imaging ... btw , the technology is [[CARDINAL]] century old , just more affordable now -- i used one that would track warm footprints on a carpet floor [[DATE]] , but it cost [[MONEY]] ... now you can get low res models for your smart phone for [[MONEY]] ...
drone = good .
well done .
i 'd have been welcomed home with love , then spanked . bless the drone guy , though
why ? the boy did n't intentionally get lost . if you 've ever been in a cornfield , you 'd know it 's easy to get turned around .
that kind of bothered me when they guy was telling he was a good boy . does n't that encourage him to go out and do it again ?
hence the spanking - probably go to jail [[DATE]] in mn except at [[FAC]] .
that 's [[CARDINAL]] of the reasons why [[ORG]] is a top state in education . they focus on things that actually help children .
hold on there -i got spanked and have [[QUANTITY]] from [[ORG]] .
the parents ? ? ?
this is awesome .
that dog is no lassie ...
great job by all . there are good people in [[GPE]] ... just not in [[ORG]] .
strong work .
so glad they found him and the dog . thank you to all of the people that looked for him .
it 's good the dog was there to keep him calm and warm . it would have been much more terrifying and dangerous if he was alone .
what a great way to start [[DATE]] . also , brittanies are some of the best family ( and bird hunting ) dogs . had one for years and still miss him . god bless you [[PERSON]] .
thanks to god . the little dog never left his side . no i 'm not crying ... that 's you crying ...
ban cornfields !
and little kids with dogs ! ! !
[[CARDINAL]] happy story .
good work ! good dog too !
flir = forward looking [[ORG]] . .
so glad they found [[PERSON]] and his dog . boys and dogs go together , such companions when your lost . thank you to the guy who found him , beautiful ending !
that 's awesome !
so glad you found me . you made my heart full . wow . such words from a child . truth . learn from it people .
meanwhile in [[GPE]] residents are spitting on those they disagree with .
so glad it had a happy ending
nice ! great job all !
although i am very happy for the child & his family , i 'd much rather watch a video of [[PERSON]] being carried - away by authorities .
she 's cold - blooded , and a drone with heat - seeking capability would n't find her in a haystack .
that says all we need to know about you .
[[ORG]] will be issuing subpoenas .
was the dog ok ?
good story for [[DATE]] . to many times it ’s the other way
glad he was found . glad he had his dog with him .
drones , they just are n't for killing terrorists anymore !
glad he was found safe and that we got to see [[ORDINAL]] hand an actual wonderful use of drone tech .
a relief , but maybe parents can convince him to check in [[ORDINAL]] and stay closer to home !
thanks to the owner of the drone for an awesome ending . praise god
amazing
children of the corn .
[[ORG]] job by all involved
thank [[PERSON]] , that ’s the scariest feeling in the world when a little one goes missing
great story and the best part is , it had absolutely nothing to do with [[NORP]] vs. [[NORP]] .
he is white , so i ’m sure only [[NORP]] bothered to search
unfortunately , you 're probably right .
dogs are the best .
happy ending and great job by the people in that community .
there are good people everywhere ! what a great story ! this is why we should leave the " helping our fellow man " to local communities and private citizens , and not delegate it to government . if there were a federal lost child location task force , it would cost [[MONEY]] per year , lose [[PERCENT]] of that in corruption , and the actual task force would have arrived after [[DATE]] ... just in time to find the body . then they 'd ask for a budget increase for [[DATE]] so they could do their jobs better .
thanks to that drone w/ thermal screening power .... kuddos to whoever had that idea ... people are amazing ....
thanking god , and the drone owner !
why thank god , he should n't have let the kid wander away in the [[ORDINAL]] place ...
a little corny but good story .
[[GPE]] work .. glad the kid was found
there will probably be an investigation . the dogs name is [[ORG]] .
lol . i read it to my wife and she laughed as well . it only goes to show you how old we all are .
someone did something with a dog . [[PERSON]] , [[GPE]] representative for [[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] congressional district
how 's the pheasant population around there ?
so there were children in the corn ? ? ? glad he is safe . and the dog too .
ppl ! it was just a lil kid playing with his dog and he got too far away from his house . just enjoy one of the few stories with a happy ending . stop trying to analyze it to death !
[[ORG]] !
so thankful for a great outcome !
[[GPE]] drone story for a change .
yay hooray !
[[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] were seen fleeing the scene with disappointed looks on their faces . . .
thanks for the low_iq comment . would n't expect anything more from a lib
you ’re trying too hard
the last holdout in the country ... a place where kids can still be kids .
many libs around , never ever safe for a kid to be left alone
he was safe . he had his dog to protect him and keep him company . a big relief for the parents .
he was lost in [[DATE]] in a snow covered cornfield in [[GPE]] . not my definition of safety for a child his age .
it was covered in snow ? where did it say that ? article said low [[DATE]] ...
nice !
[[ORG]] story ! god bless the volunteers that put this little boy [[ORDINAL]] and did everything to find him . seriously guys great job !
if this child had been sweep across this corn field by a winged angel , and the world witnessed it , there would still be someone that would make a stupid remark .
good news for a change ...
is it just me or did anyone else check to make sure the dog was ok ? ?
that ’s your big concern ? most people would think the boy was more important
a happy ending , good . we do not have enough of those [[DATE]] .
basically a group of conservative men found the boy ! ! !
i 'm happy to hear this ended positively .
it ’s heartwarming to see a community come together to help search for a lost little boy and his dog . [[CARDINAL]] people pulling together to conduct the search was incredible . thank god the little boy and his dog were found safe and quickly . excellent job folks . you should all be very proud and of course , relieved .
nice to have a story with a happy ending . that boy looks just like my grandson .
wonderful news !
that kid needs to be taught what s what !
he was . he was taught about community and love . there 's no greater lesson than that .
lame and sad ..
oh stop it . the kid and his dog were playing after being apart [[DATE]] . were you never six ? i hope you were just being snarky .
the kid needs to be taught not to wander away from home unsupervised .. what s wrong with you ?
please forgive me , oh wise and merciful one . i will never try to just enjoy a good news story ever again . you are correct . someone should be beaten and have their dog put down and have their family locked up for neglect .
glad you agree . you are dismissed . and that s all you can say when the truth is right there for you to see huh .
[[ORG]]
that s still not a worthy retort .
just part of growing up . we all make many mistakes and somehow we are still here .
ok then the parents need to be arrested for child neglect and the kid taken away
[[ORG]] ! ! !
good dog .
what a great news ! ! ! !
great that someone was watching from above - in more ways than one ! stay warm !
so when they are n't found , its because god was nt watching ?
i think many [[NORP]] ask the same questions . sometimes we do n't know why good and bad things occur in life . faith helps during both , with death not being the end of life for a [[NORP]] .
i believe they call that an " unlearned question " ...
unlearned is [[ORG]] 's base . i thought it would be acceptable .
happy ending ! wish more news stories ended that way .
great story , except for the part where a [[DATE]] was n’t met at the bus stop by [[CARDINAL]] of his parents . way too young to be left walking home alone . way too you to be left outside doing anything alone
he was with his siblings . who could only be older than he . and every child needs to be outside as much as possible . i suspect [[ORG]] has not watched enough lassie . else he would have led [[PERSON]] home .
they could be younger , or [[CARDINAL]] of them .
you are just looking for someone to blame , how about you worry about getting a life of your own .
he was with his siblings , he is out in the country , they are just fine , ca n't live in fear of everything , dontchaknow ?
he got off the bus with his " siblings " he was not alone ... geez leave the parents alone ... helicopter much ? ? ?
he was with his older siblings . maybe re - read .
it does n’t say “ older , ” maybe you should reread genius
well , it was a school bus .......... so i 'm thinking toddlers were not involved , [[PERSON]]
true , but how did he manage to get away from his siblings ? they did n't all get lost together .
at home , he and his dog ran off . there is not always someone to blame . it is perfectly normal in rural areas for children to run around out in the fields to play . it 's just that this time one got lost . the story here is how the community came together and the drone that located the boy and his dog
thank the gods .
[[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] , glad to see you home safe , also glad i did n't have a hard time trying to figure out the spelling and pronunciation of your names .
kudos to [[PERSON]] , of [[ORG]] , .. a very well done job [[PERSON]] !
that 's cool .
thank god he and the dog were found alive .
great news and a happy ending ! ! ,
thanks be to god and [[PERSON]] for finding the little guy and his dog
miracles do happen .
what a cute little fella ( and the pup ) , glad they were found safe !
hmmm children of the corn ? ? ? ?
different ending .
thank you , mr. [[PERSON]] ! great use of technology !
.. thank you for finding me , you make my heart full ... that says it all .
that god the child was found , a boy and his dog , what a great story !
[[PERSON]] invented cornfields .
[[PERSON]] invented lost children !
mr. [[PERSON]] is mighty fine .
i could n't understand what the boy said , why did he leave home ? sounded like he said he saw a hot pterodactyl ?
great news . now i hope they find cupcake in [[GPE]] .
[[PERSON]] are very smart dog , he stood with his friend until they found him .
smart people all the way around . the boy did what the boy should have done . stayed put . many lost people wander off and are found miles away from where they were lost . corn field would have been tough to find him . good dog stayed with him . good all the way around .
the [[NORP]] saved the kid 's life by keeping him warm . dogs are the only things on earth that love you more than they love themselves . my [[CARDINAL]] labrador retrievers literally " saved " and comforted me [[DATE]] when i was diagnosed with and treated for a potentially fatal disease . they stayed with me and not let me out of their sights for about 6 months ( except when i was at the doctor 's office or in the operating room ) .
dog spelled backwards is god . they will love you unconditionally and give their life for you . how do people come to harm and abuse them .... will never understand !
fact
it is too bad you do n’t have that opinion of your parents .
this is the truth .
police should have thermo drones as part of its arsenal .
liberals hate police and will never give them funding for this equipment .
good dog
happy to hear that !
i love his dog 's name ! good dog ! i 'm sure a cat would have stayed with the child .
cat ha !
what is missing from this is that it was the community looking for him , white , black , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] . it 's also missing from our country
c'm on you know the [[NORP]] did n't leave their x - box and hot pockets for a missing kid .
aw ! good dog !
now this is what technology should be used for . not wasted on social media . bravo to all of the rescuers .
yup .... perfect . :)
like handguns drones can kill but also save .
so glad to see a happy ending to this story !
awesome awesome story ! ! ! love this kind of news ! ! i would have [[ORG]] to be there with everyone when he was found ! !
that 's what 's good about [[NORP]] helping people ! ! !
what a great story with a happy ending ..
not nearly enough of those in this world !
thank the lord !
thank the mother for not watching her kid properly . this should ’ve never happened
i 'm guessing this triggered something inside you . maybe a little mental health treatment would be good for you .
because i wrote down who was actually responsible for the situation ? hmmmmm your response says a lot about you . i hope things start getting better for you .
way to go , dude ! and good dog , spot !
good old fashioned love of family and community , a boy and his dog ... kindness , caring .... makes me remember the [[DATE]] 's . no those year were not perfect .... nothing is perfect .... but it was [[GPE]] at it 's best . morals , character and values stood strong .... moms cared for their families , and by doing so women " ruled . " .... and we traded it all for what ?
a boy and his dog ! makes my heart happy !
he was just hanging out in the corn field with his pup .
good ending , good dog
praise god for the finding of this child alive and well !
who is god ? you mean the dog ?
wish people loved as much as our pets love us .....
good outcome . if you have kids , this hits your heart . poor little fella .
yeah people !
grateful the little guy and his dog were found . wonder how the parents lost him ... what were they doing ? a lot of love from the community of [[CARDINAL]] volunteers to help the parents , parent .
kids should be able to walk a short distance in safe areas . they can also move fast when playing and get lost . at [[CARDINAL]] , there are lots of investigations and explorations some of them do to understand the world around them . a gps locator is a good idea for some .
thanks , do agree the gps locator is a worthwhile tool . safe areas to me is questionable . [[CARDINAL]] never knows what dangers exists , thus the reason for my comment . believe a parent is responsible for bringing a child into the world and responsible for their lifetime support and care . too many people have children that are not committed or fitted to parents themselves .
i agree . however , kids should be encouraged to explore their surroundings and learn about their world . many people live in “ safe ” communities where neighbors look out for each other . i do . it is always sad to see neighborhoods where parents must fear to be more than a few feet from their children , or keep them in locked houses all day because of safety . that does n’t mean parents should be unaware of their children ’s location . kids need to be able to “ run and play ” to build strength and mental agility . this kid just got lost . a gps locator is called for on most kids like that . loyal dogs are often a good idea . we had one that stopped unauthorized adults from coming near the children . the kids loved him . thank goodness for his dog .
agree ... children and animals require space to explore and learn . nature truly is magnificent ! in fact , god given . even like the gps locator . great idea ! no animal , child or adult should ever have to fear and be locked in . however , reality is , parenting is more than giving birth and letting them run wild and not pay attention to their whereabouts . granted , we can all get lost ( no matter the age ) . therefore , even more important that the parenting skills be in place to be able to assist in an emergency . forget the outside concern of mankind , but include mother nature issues such as holes , sprains , tangled in brush etc . children require supervision . supervision is the parents responsibility . now , add the financial resources expended by the community . yes , [[CARDINAL]] volunteers working together ... beautiful community and unity . however , not always the case . [[ORDINAL]] responders who may have aided elderly folks but were spending their time walking around looking for this child . an elderly family member that may need assistance , but everyone took off to look for the kid that the parents lost sight of during [[DATE]] ... i question several decisions on behalf of the parents parental skills . when the child does grow up and relocates or travels , that support system may not exist for him outside the community . will he be equipped with the necessary skills or will he think back and believe ... oh , someone will take care of me .
that is why we need to learn as much about the world around us as we can . we also need to teach our children how to plan activities and defend themselves . bumps and a few bruises are normal and helpful to learning .
agree
so glad he is safe and sound . i have to say though , it took them [[TIME]] to find him . a trained dog would have found him much faster , he was [[QUANTITY]] away .
thank the lord ! so glad the dog stayed by his side to keep him safe and warm !
so happy he is safe .
what a cute little guy ! so glad they found him and his dog .
a boy and his dog , lost . sounds like the title of a good book .
