hero involves great sacrifice . good deed , good man sure . hero , like he said no . this was once normal behavior .
aww the dog is a [[PERSON]] spaniel .
[[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] - [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] -- thank you
do you know where your kids are ?
[[ORG]] ! ! ! !
your dog will be your best friend and loyal to you until the end ! i 'm very happy little [[PERSON]] had his best friend , [[ORG]] , with him !
good thing pup kept him warm ! ! !
wow
after this story broke [[DATE]] [[TIME]] , i had to google wednesday morning , to find out they were found and where [[ORG]] !
and on [[DATE]] god looked down on his wide eyed children and decided , they need a companion . so god made a dog . god said i need an animal who no matter what you did n‚Äôt do or could n‚Äôt take or did n‚Äôt win or could n‚Äôt make , will love you without judgment just the same . i need an animal strong enough to pull sleds and find bombs and yet gentle enough to love babies , find the lost , lead the blind and help a soldier forget the horror of war . an animal that will spend [[DATE]] on a couch with a resting head and supportive eyes for the broken heart . so god made a dog . it had to be an animal who would remain patient and loyal even through loneliness . an animal who would bring the family together with an open heart . an animal to bark , and then pant and then reply with the rapid wag of a tail , when their best friend says , ‚Äú let ‚Äôs go for a ride in the car . ‚Äù so god made a dog . god said i need an animal who would stand at your side when the world around you collapses . an animal to lie next to you during the long nights of pain and sorrow when it hurts to move , to talk , or think , or even be . an animal to give you strength when you have none of your own . an animal to fight when you have no fight left , to hold onto your soul to keep you in this world . an animal to be your companion and guide in this world and the next . an animal to wait for you on the other side or stand guard in your absence until they can join you for eternity . so god made a dog .
[[PERSON]] invented happy endings ...
thank you [[PERSON]] for staying with your best bud .
good job mr fines !
why is the dad and the boy bare foot the the nitwitter video ?
dogs and drones , lifesavers !
so happy they were found !
great ending ! [[ORG]] deserves some extra treats for staying with his pal .
good there was n't social media involved in this story .
always good news when little ones are found safe !
what a great story and what a great effort by the community . the loyalty of a family pet is an amazing thing
nice to hear some stories with a great ending for a change !
wonder full story ! but why was n't there someone waiting to pick him up ?
this best result is great . he was into a one dog night for sure . savor the moment folks the statistics on this are horrible . i would like to think some friendships have blossomed because of this .
why did n't the dog take him out of the field and back home ?
such great news ! thank you , lord !
best story of [[DATE]] .
a++++++++++++ !
thank you god and thank you ' village ' ! !
they would have found him a harvest time anyway .
naughty boy . it 's going to happened again .
happy they found the little guy :)
cute little tyke , awesome story , thank god for all those that searched and found them safe .
yes ! bet mom meets that bus until he graduates from now on .
what awesome news . glad he was found ok and happy he had his dog with him .
good dog . kept [[PERSON]] warm
what a great story to help my heart after all of the other awful news ..... a boy and his dog , there are few couples that can beat that !
amazing that thermal cameras have dropped so much in price that ordinary people can afford them for their drones .
typical small town .... everyone rallies to help those in need .... our big cities need to adapt more of that attitude .... ' me [[ORDINAL]] , others [[ORDINAL]] ' .... great encouraging story ! ! !
great job by all ..... also , there 's nothing like a good dog ! ! !
best story on fox [[DATE]] . so happy he was found safe . god bless everyone involved .
gack ! shades of [[PERSON]] tall grass story ! ! ! !
great story ! !
the dog had the look on its face that said ' there was nothing to worry about . the kid was with me . we knew you 'd find us . ' .
i needed that , thank you . glad they are safe .
[[ORG]] ..... thanks for sharing a story with a happy ending .......... :) .
lots of people lost in cornfields were found way before there were ever drones . drama queens .
nice ! ! drone would also come in handy during hunting season ...
great news . that drone with the heat imaging camera is awesome .
" [[ORG]] him to the cornfield ! "
read this story [[DATE]] before they found him , and my heart sank . awesome job by all who helped and thanks and praise be to god for the positive outcome .
the kid must have watched [[ORG]] 's in the tall grass .
that 's very cool tech . happy outcome .
nice ..
lassie would have shown the kid the way out of the corn field
this could be a brand new game . release kids in cornfields and contestants with drones compete for prizes as they find them .
thank god ! some good news !
thank you to [[PERSON]] for saving [[CARDINAL]] lives that day ! you are a hero .
the kid is only six years old and they let him get off a bus by himself out in the country near a cornfield without any adults watching him ? ? ?
children of the [[PERSON]] .. ?
thank god for drones .
finally a feel good story ..
extra help in finding someone - a drone with heat - seeking technology . volunteers are great !
thank god !
what about the dog ? he is a hero too !
how come mom or [[PERSON]] was n't at the bus stop .. ?
and people believe that [[PERSON]] exists ? drone can spot a [[DATE]] boy with an [[ORG]] camera , but not a [[QUANTITY]] tall primate ? lol ...
[[NORP]] job in finding [[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] . is n't modern technology wonderful when good things like this happen ! ! ! god bless all who worked to find them .
i needed this [[DATE]] ! hallelujah ! great job volunteers , that is what community is all about !
" so i told corn pop ; if you do nt help that kid get out of the corn field , you ai nt getting the money ! and son of a scarecrow ! ! ! the kid got out ! - [[PERSON]]
finally , some good news .
good . dogs surely do define loyalty .
why do n't the police and such have this tech ? it is about time that they do . it is cheaper than the overtime pay and better equipped to handle such emergencies .
been there done that and got a whuppin for it !
great news .
best story of [[DATE]] . god bless all the searchers especially the drone owner .
so wonderful they found this little one alive . things like this are so much more important that politics .
that ‚Äôs a good story .
there is more to this story that is not being told . many times these are autistic children that hide to keep out of sight of the searchers . why was this boy missing ? maybe someone was suppose to be watching him and did n't ?
happiest story ever . ! ! ! ! so glad he was found and great work by drone guy and rest of this community .
glad to see a responsible drone operator using it for good ! drones are excellent tools if used properly - ie : below [[CARDINAL]] ft and nowhere near an airport or congested flight zones .
his dog acted as his guardian angel .
what a wonderful story , so happy for this little guy , his adorable dog and his family .
just made me think of that [[ORG]] episode . send him to the cornfields became literal this time .
sometimes the good guys win . good job finding this child and his faithful companion .
great . now recall [[PERSON]] .
science , yo
thermal cameras do n't work in [[GPE]] .....
tough kid , and cute .
an awesome use for this type of drone . i ‚Äôm so glad they found him ! wonderful news .
what a good dog , [[ORG]] . he stayed faithfully with his person . dogs are a gift from god and could teach us humans a thing or [[CARDINAL]] .
give that dog a treat . it probably helped keep the boy warm .
thank you [[PERSON]] for inventing drones .
a little tiny gps tracker on the dogs collar would have made this a non issue . they are literally the size of a quarter , and you can track / find it with your phone ........
great seeing a community pull together when someone is in need . not as common as it used to be , at least in [[GPE]] .
i am so glad the [[CARDINAL]] are safe ! ! !
cuddos to the drone flyer !
truly a heart - warming story ! so glad both were found alive and safe ! god bless you , son !
nice to see some news with a happy ending for a change ....
affordable drones for the masses have been changing the world for the better since they [[ORDINAL]] came out .
so , we know he 's going to be a camper :) glad they found him !
thankful the child and his dog were found safe and are now back home . it 's such a dangerous world anymore and even in isolated places , so this little guy is so lucky ( or his guardian angel was watching over him ) no one evil intercepted him . parents need to ensure this does n't happen again , with him , or any of their other children .
that 's cool .
love this happy ending !
bad boy , great dog üëç üèº
sweet ! !
dog kept him warm !
they did n't have a helicopter with thermal camera ?
you mean a heart warming story and [[ORG]] has n't denied comments , what 's up with that ? god bless those who went on the search and helped rescue these [[CARDINAL]] young pups !
so , for all those who 've been paranoid about hobbyist drone ( [[ORG]] - unmanned [[ORG]] ) operating in / around your neighborhoods , cut them some slack ... they do more good than you 'll ever know .
very cool . good dog , too .
thank god for a good ending to this story ! !
it 's good to see a community outpouring to help find a child ! this is what [[GPE]] is all about !
good job by all including the dog .
:)
thanks to all who looked for him and to remington for staying with him ! good story to start [[DATE]] !
yes !
the dog is the real hero who stayed with that kid and kept him warm .
way to go ........ great news !
great news !
finally a positive story about what a drone equipped with a flir camera can do .
thank you jesus ! so happy this story ended with good news , god bless that community and mr. [[PERSON]] , for his fine work !
brittany , a great bird - dog . methinks it 's no accident the dog 's name is [[ORG]] .
parents should buy gps devices for their children to wear ! it 's available .
too bad we do n't have the boy scouts around anymore to teach kids how to use a compass and whatnot .
if you want to praise technology , praise the thermal imaging camera ... a thousand drones or [[CARDINAL]] searchers in hot air balloons would not have found him without thermal imaging ... btw , the technology is [[CARDINAL]] century old , just more affordable now -- i used one that would track warm footprints on a carpet floor [[DATE]] , but it cost [[MONEY]] ... now you can get low res models for your smart phone for [[MONEY]] ...
drone = good .
well done .
i 'd have been welcomed home with love , then spanked . bless the drone guy , though
the parents ? ? ?
this is awesome .
that dog is no lassie ...
great job by all . there are good people in [[GPE]] ... just not in [[ORG]] .
strong work .
so glad they found him and the dog . thank you to all of the people that looked for him .
it 's good the dog was there to keep him calm and warm . it would have been much more terrifying and dangerous if he was alone .
what a great way to start [[DATE]] . also , brittanies are some of the best family ( and bird hunting ) dogs . had one for years and still miss him . god bless you [[PERSON]] .
thanks to god . the little dog never left his side . no i 'm not crying ... that 's you crying ...
ban cornfields !
[[CARDINAL]] happy story .
good work ! good dog too !
flir = forward looking [[ORG]] . .
so glad they found [[PERSON]] and his dog . boys and dogs go together , such companions when your lost . thank you to the guy who found him , beautiful ending !
that 's awesome !
so glad you found me . you made my heart full . wow . such words from a child . truth . learn from it people .
meanwhile in [[GPE]] residents are spitting on those they disagree with .
so glad it had a happy ending
nice ! great job all !
although i am very happy for the child & his family , i 'd much rather watch a video of [[PERSON]] being carried - away by authorities .
[[ORG]] will be issuing subpoenas .
was the dog ok ?
good story for [[DATE]] . to many times it ‚Äôs the other way
glad he was found . glad he had his dog with him .
drones , they just are n't for killing terrorists anymore !
glad he was found safe and that we got to see [[ORDINAL]] hand an actual wonderful use of drone tech .
a relief , but maybe parents can convince him to check in [[ORDINAL]] and stay closer to home !
thanks to the owner of the drone for an awesome ending . praise god
amazing
children of the corn .
[[ORG]] job by all involved
thank [[PERSON]] , that ‚Äôs the scariest feeling in the world when a little one goes missing
great story and the best part is , it had absolutely nothing to do with [[NORP]] vs. [[NORP]] .
dogs are the best .
happy ending and great job by the people in that community .
there are good people everywhere ! what a great story ! this is why we should leave the " helping our fellow man " to local communities and private citizens , and not delegate it to government . if there were a federal lost child location task force , it would cost [[MONEY]] per year , lose [[PERCENT]] of that in corruption , and the actual task force would have arrived after [[DATE]] ... just in time to find the body . then they 'd ask for a budget increase for [[DATE]] so they could do their jobs better .
thanks to that drone w/ thermal screening power .... kuddos to whoever had that idea ... people are amazing ....
thanking god , and the drone owner !
a little corny but good story .
[[GPE]] work .. glad the kid was found
there will probably be an investigation . the dogs name is [[ORG]] .
someone did something with a dog . [[PERSON]] , [[GPE]] representative for [[GPE]] 's [[ORDINAL]] congressional district
how 's the pheasant population around there ?
so there were children in the corn ? ? ? glad he is safe . and the dog too .
ppl ! it was just a lil kid playing with his dog and he got too far away from his house . just enjoy one of the few stories with a happy ending . stop trying to analyze it to death !
[[ORG]] !
so thankful for a great outcome !
[[GPE]] drone story for a change .
yay hooray !
[[PERSON]] and [[PERSON]] were seen fleeing the scene with disappointed looks on their faces . . .
the last holdout in the country ... a place where kids can still be kids .
many libs around , never ever safe for a kid to be left alone
he was safe . he had his dog to protect him and keep him company . a big relief for the parents .
nice !
[[ORG]] story ! god bless the volunteers that put this little boy [[ORDINAL]] and did everything to find him . seriously guys great job !
if this child had been sweep across this corn field by a winged angel , and the world witnessed it , there would still be someone that would make a stupid remark .
good news for a change ...
is it just me or did anyone else check to make sure the dog was ok ? ?
a happy ending , good . we do not have enough of those [[DATE]] .
basically a group of conservative men found the boy ! ! !
i 'm happy to hear this ended positively .
it ‚Äôs heartwarming to see a community come together to help search for a lost little boy and his dog . [[CARDINAL]] people pulling together to conduct the search was incredible . thank god the little boy and his dog were found safe and quickly . excellent job folks . you should all be very proud and of course , relieved .
nice to have a story with a happy ending . that boy looks just like my grandson .
wonderful news !
that kid needs to be taught what s what !
[[ORG]] ! ! !
good dog .
what a great news ! ! ! !
great that someone was watching from above - in more ways than one ! stay warm !
happy ending ! wish more news stories ended that way .
great story , except for the part where a [[DATE]] was n‚Äôt met at the bus stop by [[CARDINAL]] of his parents . way too young to be left walking home alone . way too you to be left outside doing anything alone
thank the gods .
[[PERSON]] and [[ORG]] , glad to see you home safe , also glad i did n't have a hard time trying to figure out the spelling and pronunciation of your names .
kudos to [[PERSON]] , of [[ORG]] , .. a very well done job [[PERSON]] !
that 's cool .
thank god he and the dog were found alive .
great news and a happy ending ! ! ,
thanks be to god and [[PERSON]] for finding the little guy and his dog
miracles do happen .
what a cute little fella ( and the pup ) , glad they were found safe !
hmmm children of the corn ? ? ? ?
thank you , mr. [[PERSON]] ! great use of technology !
.. thank you for finding me , you make my heart full ... that says it all .
that god the child was found , a boy and his dog , what a great story !
[[PERSON]] invented cornfields .
mr. [[PERSON]] is mighty fine .
i could n't understand what the boy said , why did he leave home ? sounded like he said he saw a hot pterodactyl ?
great news . now i hope they find cupcake in [[GPE]] .
[[PERSON]] are very smart dog , he stood with his friend until they found him .
smart people all the way around . the boy did what the boy should have done . stayed put . many lost people wander off and are found miles away from where they were lost . corn field would have been tough to find him . good dog stayed with him . good all the way around .
the [[NORP]] saved the kid 's life by keeping him warm . dogs are the only things on earth that love you more than they love themselves . my [[CARDINAL]] labrador retrievers literally " saved " and comforted me [[DATE]] when i was diagnosed with and treated for a potentially fatal disease . they stayed with me and not let me out of their sights for about 6 months ( except when i was at the doctor 's office or in the operating room ) .
police should have thermo drones as part of its arsenal .
good dog
happy to hear that !
i love his dog 's name ! good dog ! i 'm sure a cat would have stayed with the child .
what is missing from this is that it was the community looking for him , white , black , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] , [[NORP]] . it 's also missing from our country
aw ! good dog !
now this is what technology should be used for . not wasted on social media . bravo to all of the rescuers .
like handguns drones can kill but also save .
so glad to see a happy ending to this story !
awesome awesome story ! ! ! love this kind of news ! ! i would have [[ORG]] to be there with everyone when he was found ! !
that 's what 's good about [[NORP]] helping people ! ! !
what a great story with a happy ending ..
thank the lord !
way to go , dude ! and good dog , spot !
good old fashioned love of family and community , a boy and his dog ... kindness , caring .... makes me remember the [[DATE]] 's . no those year were not perfect .... nothing is perfect .... but it was [[GPE]] at it 's best . morals , character and values stood strong .... moms cared for their families , and by doing so women " ruled . " .... and we traded it all for what ?
a boy and his dog ! makes my heart happy !
he was just hanging out in the corn field with his pup .
good ending , good dog
praise god for the finding of this child alive and well !
wish people loved as much as our pets love us .....
good outcome . if you have kids , this hits your heart . poor little fella .
yeah people !
grateful the little guy and his dog were found . wonder how the parents lost him ... what were they doing ? a lot of love from the community of [[CARDINAL]] volunteers to help the parents , parent .
so glad he is safe and sound . i have to say though , it took them [[TIME]] to find him . a trained dog would have found him much faster , he was [[QUANTITY]] away .
thank the lord ! so glad the dog stayed by his side to keep him safe and warm !
so happy he is safe .
what a cute little guy ! so glad they found him and his dog .
a boy and his dog , lost . sounds like the title of a good book .
