think though , what else will these drone be doing as the deliver packages ?
people are gon na need actual skills soon !
i have enough google trying penetrate my life and do nt need it overhead as well . they will add heat sensors , listening devices and cameras to detect everything about each delivery because that is what google does .
have fun with that with all the restricted airspace in the [[GPE]] . even if you fly below 300 feet .
that is the part that concerns me . how are commercial [[ORG]] pilots supposed to make a living if that happens ? i guess becoming a drone pilot for amazon is the answer . no way not happening . [[PERSON]] is a serious thing that must be what is holding them up from doing this , the technology it there .
[[CARDINAL]] of the big problems with drones is that you can lose control of it for a number of reasons .
my drone has a database of regulated airspace that gets updated regularly that allows the flight plan to work around them automatically . the drone is n't the problem here , it 's dropping packages with a string in the front yard that seems to be a issue . in the [[GPE]] , drones are considered aircraft , anyone wanting to take a potshot , would be met by the [[ORG]] since they have gps accordance of last known location .
i would n't be so sure . the gps coordinates may give the location of the drone , but they wo n't give the coordinates of the shooter . in a populated area , that could be quite a number of people . making suspects out of everyone is never in the interests of law enforcement .
these drones will have hd cameras and [[ORG]] , take a pot shot and your face will be on the [[TIME]] news .
a guy taking a potshot at a drone would fill maybe [[CARDINAL]] pixels of a frame , which is n't enough to make an identification . ( that 's assuming the camera was pointed in the correct direction . ) what would be on the [[TIME]] news is a blurry fuzzball .
you 're assuming [[CARDINAL]] improvement in camera tech ... not likely
are you anticipating hdx10 cameras anytime soon ? the only ones with cameras like that is the military , not google .
just turn on any cheap radio jammer and , bam , free stuff !
likely they would fly preprogrammed journeys based on gps coordinates . if gps ( or any radio comms ) were n't available , it would fall back to inertial guidance , and probably just return to base on its own . the only radio piece would be communicating to home base to provide status and location , but not to receive realtime flying directions for a delivery , of which it would only have one per flight . you could laser it though , and kill the flight computer or props .
the word of the day boys & girls is " highjack " … can you say that ?
open season .... lol this will be costly adventure ..
they 're gon na lose a lot of drones . free stuff if you can clip that flying toy , guys .
when that [[MONEY]] of coffee just wo n't cut it any longer and you just got ta have that [[MONEY]] , google to the rescue . . .
they busted a local kid in my city for doing dope delivers by drone . he used a money transfer app then made the drop . it apparently worked for a while until drone crashed in to a yard off a [[ORG]] home owner .
hey ! where those wing we ordered coming from ? " outback "
[[CARDINAL]] to [[CARDINAL]] . unbelievable .
on the other hand .... very large remote controlled shipping drones might just work .
here 's your new set of wine glasses delivered right to your front door ....... from [[QUANTITY]] up .
we in [[GPE]] call that " skeet with prizes " .
wait till the seagulls hear about this one .
all the hawks in my neighborhood are going to have a strong opinion about these drones .
i do n't see this working out well . there will be too many issues with this type of delivery service .
[[ORG]] practice ? especially when they fly over another persons personal residence ... ( it has to have a camera and be remotely operated so there are a whole bunch of privacy issues that will surely be violated . )
we could n’t get [[PERSON]] with a drone . what makes you think i ’m going to trust one to deliver my new [[ORG]] .
cell phones require a signature ...
horrible idea , soon looking up a beautiful blue sky will be something we refer to doing in the " good ole days " . enjoy the view while you can .
i ca n't wait to shoot down my [[ORDINAL]] [[ORG]] drone .
boycott all drove deliveries . people need good jobs .
agreed . i do n't even use the self - checkout lanes . puts people out of work .
i think having your own attack drone is [[CARDINAL]] answer . no guns , no fire , just a liberal loony playing with his new drone . i 'd be so sorry , so sorry .
it 's an april fool 's joke , just late with the delivery .
i dare you to fly over my property . go ahead , make my day .
you do not own or control the airspace over your property . shooting down a delivery drone would knock a big hole in your wallet .
way wrong answer . better look it up .
and what do they do after multiple reports of stolen packages swiped from front yards ?
the packages are place on the roof .
exactly . listen for the buzz , hone in , free products [[DATE]] long . the thieves are drooling already .
when they figure out manned drones are easier to protect and have a much greater carry capacity and do n't reduce jobs those mini drones will be quickly replaced for shipping items ... as will cars . that s not to say there is nt a good use for those tiny drones for some things ... but i 'm counting on the bigger things becoming the prefered method of delivery ... the ones you can actually fly inside . there will come a point where we will have to redefine the word " drone " .
i 'm surprised that [[GPE]] , with its excessive regulations , would be the [[ORDINAL]] country to get this service .
it will be [[DATE]] before " everyone " can get a service like this . for now it will only be available in more affluent communities where they are less likely to be vandalized . this is incredibly cool though , and if humans in general were more trustworthy , it could become the norm .
i 'm wondering whether drone delivery will be much more expensive that a normal delivery . i 'm not sure how much these commercial delivery drones cost , but it has to be much more than the small drone i can buy . buying the drone . training people to keep it flying . recharging the drone . drone down time for repairs or maintenance . all of that times [[CARDINAL]] of drones in a drone delivery squadron . somehow keeping them all flying [[TIME]] a day ? i think this type of service is going to be niche and much more expensive than waiting [[DATE]] two days for your amazon prime delivery .
my neighbor kept flying his drone over my house at [[TIME]] , my scoped pellet rifle ended that little game .
craigs mom 's [[PERSON]] ..... this is how it begins . that poor woman .
i was raised in a house with [[ORG]] , that had a well for water . from that time , i have watched tech advance until .. shockingly , [[DATE]] i was able to purchase , and own my very own [[ORG]] . an incredible thing . then came " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " , that you carried in a bag , they were rather large , and very cumbersome . now my smart phone , is small , light weight , and has more processing power than my [[ORDINAL]] computer , far more . today i read of drones that can deliver items you order , over the internet , using a mobile device . i love technology , i just hope i live long enough to see the next few amazing things that are coming in the future .
i wonder how many will be shot out of the sky ? if you do n't think people will make sport out of destroying these things you would be a true clown .
since it would be a federal crime i think not many after the [[ORDINAL]] few .
in [[GPE]] ? probably not many at all .
what are they delivering ? ? ? just a picture of the search engine ?
lots of trustworthy , [[NORP]] " hood - citizens " ca nt wait for these .
