think though , what else will these drone be doing as the deliver packages ?
people are gon na need actual skills soon !
i have enough google trying penetrate my life and do nt need it overhead as well . they will add heat sensors , listening devices and cameras to detect everything about each delivery because that is what google does .
have fun with that with all the restricted airspace in the [[GPE]] . even if you fly below 300 feet .
just turn on any cheap radio jammer and , bam , free stuff !
the word of the day boys & girls is " highjack " … can you say that ?
open season .... lol this will be costly adventure ..
they 're gon na lose a lot of drones . free stuff if you can clip that flying toy , guys .
when that [[MONEY]] of coffee just wo n't cut it any longer and you just got ta have that [[MONEY]] , google to the rescue . . .
they busted a local kid in my city for doing dope delivers by drone . he used a money transfer app then made the drop . it apparently worked for a while until drone crashed in to a yard off a [[ORG]] home owner .
hey ! where those wing we ordered coming from ? " outback "
[[CARDINAL]] to [[CARDINAL]] . unbelievable .
on the other hand .... very large remote controlled shipping drones might just work .
here 's your new set of wine glasses delivered right to your front door ....... from [[QUANTITY]] up .
we in [[GPE]] call that " skeet with prizes " .
wait till the seagulls hear about this one .
i do n't see this working out well . there will be too many issues with this type of delivery service .
[[ORG]] practice ? especially when they fly over another persons personal residence ... ( it has to have a camera and be remotely operated so there are a whole bunch of privacy issues that will surely be violated . )
we could n’t get [[PERSON]] with a drone . what makes you think i ’m going to trust one to deliver my new [[ORG]] .
horrible idea , soon looking up a beautiful blue sky will be something we refer to doing in the " good ole days " . enjoy the view while you can .
i ca n't wait to shoot down my [[ORDINAL]] [[ORG]] drone .
boycott all drove deliveries . people need good jobs .
i think having your own attack drone is [[CARDINAL]] answer . no guns , no fire , just a liberal loony playing with his new drone . i 'd be so sorry , so sorry .
it 's an april fool 's joke , just late with the delivery .
i dare you to fly over my property . go ahead , make my day .
and what do they do after multiple reports of stolen packages swiped from front yards ?
when they figure out manned drones are easier to protect and have a much greater carry capacity and do n't reduce jobs those mini drones will be quickly replaced for shipping items ... as will cars . that s not to say there is nt a good use for those tiny drones for some things ... but i 'm counting on the bigger things becoming the prefered method of delivery ... the ones you can actually fly inside . there will come a point where we will have to redefine the word " drone " .
i 'm surprised that [[GPE]] , with its excessive regulations , would be the [[ORDINAL]] country to get this service .
it will be [[DATE]] before " everyone " can get a service like this . for now it will only be available in more affluent communities where they are less likely to be vandalized . this is incredibly cool though , and if humans in general were more trustworthy , it could become the norm .
i 'm wondering whether drone delivery will be much more expensive that a normal delivery . i 'm not sure how much these commercial delivery drones cost , but it has to be much more than the small drone i can buy . buying the drone . training people to keep it flying . recharging the drone . drone down time for repairs or maintenance . all of that times [[CARDINAL]] of drones in a drone delivery squadron . somehow keeping them all flying [[TIME]] a day ? i think this type of service is going to be niche and much more expensive than waiting [[DATE]] two days for your amazon prime delivery .
my neighbor kept flying his drone over my house at [[TIME]] , my scoped pellet rifle ended that little game .
craigs mom 's [[PERSON]] ..... this is how it begins . that poor woman .
i was raised in a house with [[ORG]] , that had a well for water . from that time , i have watched tech advance until .. shockingly , [[DATE]] i was able to purchase , and own my very own [[ORG]] . an incredible thing . then came " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " , that you carried in a bag , they were rather large , and very cumbersome . now my smart phone , is small , light weight , and has more processing power than my [[ORDINAL]] computer , far more . today i read of drones that can deliver items you order , over the internet , using a mobile device . i love technology , i just hope i live long enough to see the next few amazing things that are coming in the future .
i wonder how many will be shot out of the sky ? if you do n't think people will make sport out of destroying these things you would be a true clown .
what are they delivering ? ? ? just a picture of the search engine ?
lots of trustworthy , [[NORP]] " hood - citizens " ca nt wait for these .
