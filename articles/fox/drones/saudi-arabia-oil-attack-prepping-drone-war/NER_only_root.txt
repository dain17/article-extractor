just install a couple of phalanx ciws systems . problem solved .
the threat of drones had to be known to every military . difficult to think this was a total surprise .
send more troops to the region yet apparently drone strikes and a defense against them is not [[PERCENT]] . so are we giving them our troops for drone target practice ?
we 're wide open for the same style attack here from drones . everybody owns [[CARDINAL]] now .
no [[GPE]] bots on the ground , technology support and kill [[GPE]] economy , if the [[NORP]] want they can shot a dozen missiles against [[GPE]] and we will see [[ORG]] 2020 65 [[NORP]] seats in [[ORG]] [[DATE]]
[[GPE]] was attacked by [[GPE]] , and the [[NORP]] should be the ones that respond to them , not the [[GPE]]
attacking unarmed civilians with weapons of war ? that is a violation of [[LAW]] . let â€™s not usher in a new era of drone warfare , rather let governing bodies of the world realize that there is something cruel about the inherent lack of accountability with drones that will never be reconciled .
ban drones .
it 's like having a pool full of gasoline in your backyard and fire flies are n't allowed to land in or on it .
there is more to this than we know . this is the future of warfare . nanotechnology could be the answer to defend against this .
[[ORG]] bomb the country of origin . problem solved .
forget the ar-15 . drones are the new thing . [[ORG]] will protect my right to own a drone ?
[[PERSON]] has to know the manufacturer and origin of these drones by now . they just are n't saying . this could all end badly for everyone .
where is [[PERSON]] when you need him ?
i do not believe for one second that this attack was unstoppable . the largest oil refinery on earth and it had no air defenses ? ? please .... nobody shot down the drones because they did not want to . best way to goad [[GPE]] into proxy war with [[GPE]] .
well , a lot of companies are planning to use drone package delivery systems in near future . probably a good time to buy a gun so you can shoot drones for fun . shooting drones are allowed in states with stand your ground laws .
[[CARDINAL]] way to address this is to turn a 10mile radius around the launch site for each drone or missile into a smoking hole in the ground , regardless of what lies inside that radius . if that does n't work , start with the closest known government center and obliterate it . this latest attack is a [[NORP]] problem , the next attack on any [[GPE]] civilian or military target should be viewed as a declaration of war and all level of responses should be on the table . it would n't take long to get [[GPE]] under control . if the [[NORP]] do n't like that prospect , they can fix it themselves - now .
[[ORG]] , [[ORG]] ... sounds like a star wars sequel .
the best way to defend against drone attacks is to take them out before they take off . it is almost time to stop [[GPE]] dead in it 's tracks . just like [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] ca n't fly their drones and aircraft without fuel . [[GPE]] was attacked and they should be the ones who use an equal military response . if any country attacked a [[GPE]] oil factory i am sure they would have already faced the might of the [[GPE]] military .
sending armed drones and missiles , just like bombers or ground troops into a country is an act of war , if you do n't mind that ... prepare to be conquered . if you do mind , fight back ... hint , hint .
the country / entity with the most technology and wealth wins the drones wars . winning against [[GPE]] will just take patience and a cool head . [[PERSON]] beat the [[NORP]] with a star wars approach . [[GPE]] and it 's allies can get [[GPE]] back in line by having a coordinated response .
