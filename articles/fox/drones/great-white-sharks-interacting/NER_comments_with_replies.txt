that 's the technique i use , too .
i was expecting something of more profound value here - they knew they bite each other from time to time and ca n't tell what happened in the video exactly .
that water looks pretty shallow .
he was just trying to get some she rebuffed his advances and found the nearest exit having been through this more times than i care to admit , i feel your pain mr . [[PERSON]]
nice burst of speed there
i 'll never get that [[TIME]] back ...
[[ORG]] stated---- " we 're clueless . but because i have [[DATE]] of education , we ca n't just come out and say we 're clueless " .
" experts knew that great white 's interacted before , " . what gave it away , the baby white sharks ? lol
the continued presence of baby sharks tells me they interact plenty ...
shark love !
[[ORG]] and [[GPE]] .
looks like [[FAC]] loves to slap around with that fist she need to get examined starting to go flopsy .
geez , guys ! give them some privacy ! i think that was a little love nibble .
ashley grace sounds like a porn star name .
you mean shark interact ! ! . i thought the came from immaculate conception .
come on ! we all have the same goal ... sharks are n't any better .
[[PERSON]] silly fast !
and we grant money for this ? ? ? ?
well , there would n't be any little [[ORG]] if they did n't interact .
white sharks matter .
not true . we 've seen them interacting before . please . science , shmience .
interacting or sizing each other up ? i 'm going with the latter [[CARDINAL]]
" some of the sharks were spotted using [[LOC]] conservancy app . " how they accessed the app remains a mystery .
is that some sort of dating app the sharks use to find each other ?
so if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound ? this is silly , all species interract with one another . how do they think the animals reproduce ? we 've seen mamas swimming with their young . just because it has n't been recorded does n't mean it does n't happen .
artificial insemination ?
in the video , a smaller shark ... we'll call him " biden" .... swims up to a larger shark .... we'll call her " jailbait" .... and attempts to sniff and grope her .... "jailbait " clearly wants nothing to do with " [[PERSON]] " and fights him off and swims away as quickly as possible ...
she 's just playing hard to get . they will be making more man eaters shortly .
[[ORG]] ! this going to rewrite everything they know about sharks !
if they never interact , how are baby great whites made ?
is n't it shark week ?
do sharks yell , “ shark ! ” ?
they are proud of their great white privilege .
if dr. [[PERSON]] of [[ORG]] is being quoted correctly ( “ experts knew that great white 's interacted before , but had never seen it in action ” ) , then he is either severely incompetent or lying ( or an incompetent liar , perhaps ? ) . [[DATE]] i saw a documentary showing a group of [[ORG]] feasting on a dead whale . the sharks ate so much , they started acting as if in a stupor . the documentary explained that perhaps those calming feasts provide an opportunity for the sharks to get friendly and mate . perhaps i should apply for a federal grant to research the name of the documentary , so i can then share it with the “ experts ” .
that could explain all of the little [[ORG]] sharks
wrong ! [[PERSON]] invents them silly ..... smh
you 've got a point
if the animal world ever develops the power of reasoning we are all in alot of trouble .
looks like he was just trying to get some lovin . seems like she had a headache .
lazy days of summer when a young shark 's mind turns to loveeee ...
it looked like a minor scuffle over territory .
or [[CARDINAL]] was a [[NORP]] and the other a [[NORP]]
wearing a maga hat . :)
sorry but [[NORP]] have filmed this shark behavior for [[DATE]] off the western cape .
is n't it racial prejudice for the media to concentrate on [[FAC]] sharks and ignore any great black sharks . where are the activists and protesters on this issue ?
there is only one " black shark " and that 's the black demon shark in [[LOC]]
do n't take my word , " [[ORG]] it " ... it 's relative of the megaladon
i guess the black sharks just are n't all that great ? are they mediocre ?
she was playing hard to get .
they seemed to be communicating together just fine when searching for nemo
hehe
how do they think baby sharks are made ?
by the stork fish
i do n't know , but from the looks of it i 'd say very carefully .
so the big white shark is called great and the largely black whale is called [[PERSON]] ? is [[PERSON]] aware of this outrage ?
[[PERSON]] ... i never thought of it before ... now i bet aoc will demand they be renamed , and any past references be eliminated .
one asked the other " you gon na eat that fatty ? " they other said " nope i m on a gluten free diet "
