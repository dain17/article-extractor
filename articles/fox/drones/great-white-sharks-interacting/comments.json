The sharks ate so much, they started acting as if in a stupor. The documentary explained that perhaps those calming feasts provide an opportunity for the sharks to get friendly and mate.\n \nPerhaps I should apply for a federal grant to research the name of the documentary, so I can then share it with the “experts”.",
