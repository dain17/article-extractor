[[ORG]] , without [[ORG]] 's crew .
they are in cahoots with the [[ORG]] robots ! ! ! !
autonomy and robotics will replace [[PERCENT]] of existing employment in [[GPE]] before [[DATE]] . [[GPE]] did not affect manufacturing nearly as much as [[ORG]] , for example a car used to take more than 40 factory hours to build in [[DATE]] ... today it is less than 18 factory hours . all due to [[WORK_OF_ART]] . the port of [[GPE]] loads and unloads [[CARDINAL]] ships simultaneously with a single person overseeing all [[CARDINAL]] autonomous systems , that system will spread to the world not just for ports but across logistical supply chain .
new careers for the joystick generation .
i think that they should have a class of drones that swarm a ship and when they get close , fire off a field of chaff to block the ship 's radar . we would still be able to spot them on radar ( albeit kind of fuzzily ) , but they would n't be able to get any signal in or out .
wonder when all these drones and bots finally get tired of taking orders from humans .
with [[DATE]] 's mentality , you are best suited into quadrupling the robotics order ... you are going to need all the help you can get , at least this way , you do n't have to worry about offending anyone !
a vehicle that runs on water . i knew it could be done .
maybe they can get the enemy to wear [[ORG]] vests .
make sure that when the link with the mother ship is broken , that the drone and boats can still carry out their attack without human intervention . that way when [[ORG]] and total civil war the world over comes as promised in the [[FAC]] , where almost all men are killed when set to war , then the survivors can curse you for your terminator machines , after the remaining women have sex ( [[WORK_OF_ART]] ) with the fallen angels again ... [[PERSON]] for [[DATE]] that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until [[DATE]] that [[PERSON]] entered into the ark , isa 4:1 and in [[DATE]] women shall take hold of [[CARDINAL]] man , saying , we will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by thy name , to take away our reproach .
a good idea as long as they do n't make it so expensive that we ca n't afford enugh ,
its all good until it becomes self aware .. .
i think its is great . now enemies wo n't have the death of sailors on their conscious when they sink one of our ships .
drone wars ... well , better than humans .
" he 's a robot from the future . living tissue over a metal skeleton . he means you no harm . " [[PERSON]]
skynet , waternet
more like , free arms for pirates ...
i wonder if the shielding will stand up to a massive [[ORG]] burst . most electronics are rendered dead once an [[ORG]] is detonated . drone wars . this would be an awesome movie .
all that grand theft auto time is paying off for some kids ..
the congressional [[NORP]] have already filed a cease and desist order based on the fact this military move gives [[GPE]] an unfair advantage to less advanced countries .
[[PERSON]] has been replaced with a boat .
imagine that ! arming attack boats !
[[GPE]] has become aware .
will they run shallow , like in [[FAC]] ? lots of work down there for them ....
the future is [[ORG]] ! ...
cyberdyne systems
what could possibly go wrong ?
president [[GPE]] should declare climate change to be an emergency and then divert funding being wasted on this bs into green energy intiatives .
anyone else imagining the [[PRODUCT]] carrier ship with drones ?
great ! as long as it does n't get hacked or an electromagnetic pulse ( [[ORG]] ) does not render it useless . that said , i like the idea of " drones " in warfare .
i doubt the [[NORP]] would try to take one of these .
