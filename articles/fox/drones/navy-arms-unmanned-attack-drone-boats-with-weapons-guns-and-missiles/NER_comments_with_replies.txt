[[ORG]] , without [[ORG]] 's crew .
they are in cahoots with the [[ORG]] robots ! ! ! !
beginning to sound just like beginnings of [[GPE]] .
autonomy and robotics will replace [[PERCENT]] of existing employment in [[GPE]] before [[DATE]] . [[GPE]] did not affect manufacturing nearly as much as [[ORG]] , for example a car used to take more than 40 factory hours to build in [[DATE]] ... today it is less than 18 factory hours . all due to [[WORK_OF_ART]] . the port of [[GPE]] loads and unloads [[CARDINAL]] ships simultaneously with a single person overseeing all [[CARDINAL]] autonomous systems , that system will spread to the world not just for ports but across logistical supply chain .
why then do we keep allowing low educated , unskilled , parasites into this country ? oh yeah , that 's right . they 're future [[NORP]] .
[[PERCENT]] of [[ORG]] workers that actually pick crops are illegal aliens , that is [[ORG]] numbers .
so you are making the case for the end of money , since people wo n't be able to earn it anyway . maybe we should just all work for the betterment of humanity instead . free everything .
new careers for the joystick generation .
times change and warfare evolves . there will always be a need for that human touch though .
i think that they should have a class of drones that swarm a ship and when they get close , fire off a field of chaff to block the ship 's radar . we would still be able to spot them on radar ( albeit kind of fuzzily ) , but they would n't be able to get any signal in or out .
wonder when all these drones and bots finally get tired of taking orders from humans .
with [[DATE]] 's mentality , you are best suited into quadrupling the robotics order ... you are going to need all the help you can get , at least this way , you do n't have to worry about offending anyone !
a vehicle that runs on water . i knew it could be done .
maybe they can get the enemy to wear [[ORG]] vests .
make sure that when the link with the mother ship is broken , that the drone and boats can still carry out their attack without human intervention . that way when [[ORG]] and total civil war the world over comes as promised in the [[FAC]] , where almost all men are killed when set to war , then the survivors can curse you for your terminator machines , after the remaining women have sex ( [[WORK_OF_ART]] ) with the fallen angels again ... [[PERSON]] for [[DATE]] that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until [[DATE]] that [[PERSON]] entered into the ark , isa 4:1 and in [[DATE]] women shall take hold of [[CARDINAL]] man , saying , we will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by thy name , to take away our reproach .
a good idea as long as they do n't make it so expensive that we ca n't afford enugh ,
its all good until it becomes self aware .. .
i think its is great . now enemies wo n't have the death of sailors on their conscious when they sink one of our ships .
drone wars ... well , better than humans .
for us ..... not for our enemies üëç
[[GPE]] and [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] , all have pretty advanced drone tech ... the danger is [[GPE]] teaming with [[GPE]] ... [[NORP]] technology with [[NORP]] manufacturing capacity ... they can cranks out [[CARDINAL]] of drones a day .
" he 's a robot from the future . living tissue over a metal skeleton . he means you no harm . " [[PERSON]]
skynet , waternet
more like , free arms for pirates ...
i wonder if the shielding will stand up to a massive [[ORG]] burst . most electronics are rendered dead once an [[ORG]] is detonated . drone wars . this would be an awesome movie .
all that grand theft auto time is paying off for some kids ..
the congressional [[NORP]] have already filed a cease and desist order based on the fact this military move gives [[GPE]] an unfair advantage to less advanced countries .
[[PERSON]] has another agenda .
no doubt !
[[PERSON]] has been replaced with a boat .
[[PERSON]] [[GPE]] has been replaced . [[PERSON]] has been replaced with a chip .
imagine that ! arming attack boats !
[[GPE]] has become aware .
" it 's in your nature to destroy yourselves "
how true that actually is ...
will they run shallow , like in [[FAC]] ? lots of work down there for them ....
the future is [[ORG]] ! ...
cyberdyne systems
what could possibly go wrong ?
president [[GPE]] should declare climate change to be an emergency and then divert funding being wasted on this bs into green energy intiatives .
you know [[GPE]] is a member of the [[ORG]] agreement yet is the world 's [[MONEY]] . trump was right for pulling out of that , you are just too ignorant to understand why . you only see the face value " trump is against the green movement " when in reality he is n't . he did n't want to be part of something that would hamstring the [[GPE]] while it continued to allow [[GPE]] to treat the world like an industrial toilet .
it 's assumed . she does n't have to say it .
professor [[ORG]] said [[CARDINAL]] [[PERSON]] i will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully . titus 2:5 to be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of god be not blasphemed .
tell that to [[GPE]] .
anyone else imagining the [[PRODUCT]] carrier ship with drones ?
great ! as long as it does n't get hacked or an electromagnetic pulse ( [[ORG]] ) does not render it useless . that said , i like the idea of " drones " in warfare .
i doubt the [[NORP]] would try to take one of these .
that 's probably why we got them .
