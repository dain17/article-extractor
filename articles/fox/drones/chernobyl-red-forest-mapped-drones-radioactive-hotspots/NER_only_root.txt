[[PERSON]] is worse
[[GPE]] is plenty safe place for the proponents of nuclear power to live . they should n't take any women as the children might not be normal .
[[ORG]] . why in the hell do you show videos that play themselves with load narration that do n't pertain to the article sometimes and when they do pertain to the article you put the caption in front of the video so you ca n't see it ? so what is the sense in having videos ?
i know all of the radiation hotspots . i played that call of duty 4 mission a [[CARDINAL]] times .
there was a lack of feedback of operating experience and the inadequacy of communication between designers , engineers , manufacturers , constructors , operators and regulators . these deficiencies , coupled with a lack of clear lines of responsibility , were critical factors in the events leading up to the [[GPE]] accident .
the lack of nightmarish man - eating mutant creatures emerging from [[GPE]] is a grave disappointment .
third trumpet in [[GPE]] ? [[GPE]] 's direct translation from [[WORK_OF_ART]] . star = nuclear , poisoned the waters .. etc etc .. makes sense to me . there is also a memorial there of an angel blowing a trumpet called the star of wormwood memorial .. seems the whole world aknowledges this reality ..
ah those fun loving [[NORP]] such a great asset to this world .
the fruits of communism .
nuclear power plants are extremely clean . the only reason that this plant fail was because the workers were not paid enough to care . that 's communism for you .
and this was just [[CARDINAL]] nuclear reactor . political party affiliation does n't matter here . mankind better wake the up . hope i 'm not here when the hits the fan .
solar panels at the site ? wth ?
make it the new congressional chamber .
when [[GPE]] is down by natural disasters , [[GPE]] will nuke [[GPE]] [[GPE]] [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] accept jesus repent forgive
now that is a great place for solar panels .
when asked for comment about this [[ORG]] replied .... "yes i think [[PERSON]] is very noble and a good [[NORP]] too "
nonsense ! nuclear energy is the safe alternative to fossil fuels . we need to concern ourselves with cow farts , skyscrapers and plastic straws if we 're going to save the world .
whatta mess ...... ever seen those weird looking creatures living there now ?
perfect place to house our illegal immigrants while they wait [[DATE]] for their asylum cases to be heard
no kidding .
read the survey , basically they found that the current levels of contamination are not " evenly distributed . " most areas are totally fit for human habitation , though " elevated above that of most natural sites . " the most contaminated area is an old spent fuel warehouse where " exposure for [[TIME]] would dose a person with as much radiation as is normally absorbed over [[DATE]] . " the average [[DATE]] exposure for a person from natural sources is [[QUANTITY]] , so the site maxes out at [[QUANTITY]] per hour . the maximum dose allowed by our government is 5 rem ( [[QUANTITY]] ) per year , which is so low there is no detectable risk , so one could tour the most contaminated parts of the area for over 24 hours without risk . interesting study .
build more nuclear plants in [[GPE]] , [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] .
welcome to our future .
that ’s a very large oof
seems like the perfect vacation spot for the [[NORP]] .
[[PERSON]] would have never let this happen . [[PERSON]] !
this would be a great place for pelosi to mix up her evil brews for president [[PERSON]] .
it 's those [[CARDINAL]] ft squirrels you really have to watch our for .
[[PERSON]] told [[ORG]] was fake news , [[ORG]] says he believes him .
[[PERSON]] invented radiation
send all our [[NORP]] there .
it 's only a matter of time before a rave festival happens here ... if it has n't already ...
there are people that refused to evacuate from [[GPE]] and are still living there . mostly old women now .
no telling what they are chem trailing us with now .
this was such a great tragedy in world history . so many people died and this area destroyed . i hope we learned from this great mistake and never let it happen again .
[[ORG]] documentary included a field trip into [[GPE]] zone , and details on after effects . nothing like the wild horror stories . other reactors at the site kept on operating for [[DATE]] .
[[PERSON]] blames trump for [[GPE]]
i watched that [[GPE]] movie . it 's all good now . just do n't eat the fish and you wo n't glow in the dark .
i know a teacher there after the blast who was ordered to clean the desks with soap and water , without protective gear and she ended up with thyroid cancer . soap and water
[[PERSON]] is worse than [[GPE]] . [[PERSON]] is still dumping radiated water into the [[LOC]] . we wo n't know the extent of this damage for [[DATE]] to come . humans need to develop other power sources than nuclear . nuclear power is not the way to go .
between articles like this and the new " [[GPE]] " miniseries on [[ORG]] , i am beginning to wonder if the environmental lobby is trying to stifle the renewed interest in nuclear power .
the [[ORG]] series about the disaster began [[TIME]] ... for the younger people , it would be a good idea to watch how [[NORP]] work .
[[GPE]] ’s final weather forecast : “ overcast and [[QUANTITY]] . “
what is up with including a ' slideshow ' of the same exact wording in the story below it ? i can understand embedding video that supports the story .... but to click play only to see a ' powerpoint ' presentation with music and the same wording from the story is a waste of time .
soon to be call [[GPE]] . yes . let us all keep ruining the only planet to sustain human life . as long as ego and greed rule the world ...
drones ? why did n't they just ask the people who still live there to do the survey ? [[CARDINAL]] former residents returned shortly after the accident , [[CARDINAL]] still live there [[DATE]] .
relocate [[ORG]] headquarters there please
despite all the bad press and the couple of rare accidents , it still seems that nuclear is the most efficient form of clean energy . true , the rare accident is quite deadly but so is a plane crash .
it is a beautiful place now , no people just nature and animals retaking the planet .
the left should be happy they hate [[GPE]]
who are the poor workers that are going to install the solar panels in that area ! crazy !
have n’t heard much about [[PERSON]] . that ’s a pretty bad one too .
[[ORG]] should go visit the location to see if there is anything she can do to help
i would be curious to know about the boar in [[GPE]] . it seems strange that his levels were so high . it makes me wonder how often countries cover their own nuclear blunders by blaming [[GPE]] . i ’m not that well educated on radiation exposure , so i may be off base , but i would think that if the boar had radiation levels that high , then many other creatures in the region should too . it should n’t be rare . perhaps he came in contact with something more contained and a bit closer to home ?
