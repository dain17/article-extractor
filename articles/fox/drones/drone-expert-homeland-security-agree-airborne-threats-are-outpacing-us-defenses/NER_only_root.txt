< < < agrees that airborne threats like mosquitoes are threatening defenses
shotguns for everybody ! problem not solved but greatly diminished .
just put a bounty on them ... it 's good practice for dove season .
i suggest they train some people with 10 gauge goose guns . a few good shooters can take out a " flock of drones " given enough practice .
it 's going to happen eventually . it 's no great feat to rig an improvised directional mine similar to a claymore to the underside of [[CARDINAL]] of these & set it off above a crowd . there 's plenty of expertise in [[ORG]] right now that could do it & it will make its way here .
[[GPE]] just passed a law that forces drone manufactures to hard code a unique id on the circuitry and on the parts of a drone . the drone when purchased must be licensed with the [[NORP]] government along with the [[NORP]] id of the drone . people who fly drones must be licensed to fly drones . the licensee must provide the [[NORP]] id of all drones they fly . all drones must respond with their [[PERSON]] when scanned by [[ORG]] . all drones that do not meet this criteria will be considered hostile and destroyed .
solution ? [[ORDINAL]] shotgun , [[CARDINAL]] in magnum loads , # [[MONEY]] shot , full choke .
... just wait until the bad guys start weaponizing squirrels , pigeons , dogs , and cats ... then we 'll have real problems !
must be a [[NORP]] push perceived threat and nothing more . so far the odds are about 1 in [[CARDINAL]] . not sure we need regulations for something that has n't proven to be a threat . the threat is n't single drones . it 's the [[CARDINAL]] pretargeted drones a [[NORP]] sub could launch . it takes [[MONEY]] to produce a drone capable of carrying enough explosive to be a concern .
[[DATE]] defense budget should be increased to [[MONEY]] per year .
drones are scary business . they should be illegal for non - commercial and non- military consumers .
come - on , this is intelligence ? ok , let me make it simple for you guys , these drones work on a set range of frequency for control , overwhelm the frequency with a powerful signal , total loss of control will occur . if only our intelligence agencies has some intelligence it would make it a lot easier .
time to get the navair spike missile into production . it 's a " fire and forget " optically guided mini - missile , with a low cost compared to most guided missiles . it 's perfectly suited for these drones .
let 's do away with another fun toy / tool ... because there are some twisted enough to use them to destroy ... sounds like a solid plan . but wait , cars can carry bombs too , why are n't we regulating those off the market ... or planes ? ? ? we have seen what a plane can do ... you cannot regulate yourself into a safe place ... laws give consequence for acting incorrectly , they simply do not make anyone act the way they should ...
scramble their control frequencies , watch them crash .
must be a [[NORP]] push for more regulation . wow , do they run scared all the time ? " [[ORG]] was able to confirm that some of the best - selling consumer / commercial drones – which are widely available in stores and on the internet - are indeed capable of carrying enough weight to deliver payloads that could do serious damage . " [[QUANTITY]] at best for a store purchased drone . is [[ORG]] available to a consumer . nope .
