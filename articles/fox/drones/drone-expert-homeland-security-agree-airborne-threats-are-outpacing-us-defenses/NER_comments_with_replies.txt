< < < agrees that airborne threats like mosquitoes are threatening defenses
shotguns for everybody ! problem not solved but greatly diminished .
just put a bounty on them ... it 's good practice for dove season .
that is actually an excellent idea ! make the bounty 1/2 the retail price of the drone model and legalize shooting if it 's semi - over your or your neighbors ' private property , or outside of approved " drone zones " . [[ORG]] ! !
i suggest they train some people with 10 gauge goose guns . a few good shooters can take out a " flock of drones " given enough practice .
it 's going to happen eventually . it 's no great feat to rig an improvised directional mine similar to a claymore to the underside of [[CARDINAL]] of these & set it off above a crowd . there 's plenty of expertise in [[ORG]] right now that could do it & it will make its way here .
[[GPE]] just passed a law that forces drone manufactures to hard code a unique id on the circuitry and on the parts of a drone . the drone when purchased must be licensed with the [[NORP]] government along with the [[NORP]] id of the drone . people who fly drones must be licensed to fly drones . the licensee must provide the [[NORP]] id of all drones they fly . all drones must respond with their [[PERSON]] when scanned by [[ORG]] . all drones that do not meet this criteria will be considered hostile and destroyed .
solution ? [[ORDINAL]] shotgun , [[CARDINAL]] in magnum loads , # [[MONEY]] shot , full choke .
... just wait until the bad guys start weaponizing squirrels , pigeons , dogs , and cats ... then we 'll have real problems !
must be a [[NORP]] push perceived threat and nothing more . so far the odds are about 1 in [[CARDINAL]] . not sure we need regulations for something that has n't proven to be a threat . the threat is n't single drones . it 's the [[CARDINAL]] pretargeted drones a [[NORP]] sub could launch . it takes [[MONEY]] to produce a drone capable of carrying enough explosive to be a concern .
[[DATE]] defense budget should be increased to [[MONEY]] per year .
drones are scary business . they should be illegal for non - commercial and non- military consumers .
people misuse all kinds of technology . nanny cams removed and put in bathroom stalls , skimmers to get your cc info ... not saying what you are experiencing is justified or right , because it is n't ... but you do n't outlaw computers because a very small number ( compared to the general populace ) twisted individuals do illegal and despicable thing on them .
yes , every piece of technology has the potential to be abused . the problem with drones is they can be armed and dangerous to civilians , and surreptitiously so .
and cellphones can be attached to incendiary devices and bombs . nails can be used in bombs as well for shrapnel . a car remote starter can be used as a remote detonator . all just as dangerous ... potentially . go after the people that misuse the tech , not the tech that can and usually is beneficial tot he public .
if you feel that way , you should also be asking for the confiscation and destruction of all camera ready phones , lol . camera 's are everywhere . i do n't have a drone nor have a desire for one , but can see their appeal .
unless you 're a peeping tom at the window , your phone camera is n't going to invade my privacy . but i 've already seen drones hovering high above my bathroom skylight . i 'm not cool with that .
drones are scary except when the military uses them .... for killing .....
drones are scary , regardless of who is using them .
that [[PERSON]] is already out of the bottle . you can buy parts to make your own drones , and the programs or controlling them are online in many places .
i know , and we 're all going to regret it . i saw a drone looking into our house through our skylight . not good .
come - on , this is intelligence ? ok , let me make it simple for you guys , these drones work on a set range of frequency for control , overwhelm the frequency with a powerful signal , total loss of control will occur . if only our intelligence agencies has some intelligence it would make it a lot easier .
give me an example of what you think these " other ways " are .
not true regardless of the frequency it is just as easy to jam , and very easy to control the area being jammed . that is exactly why the frequency that military drone function on is such a guarded secret .
uh , spread - spectrum is a form of frequency hopping . it 's a wide - band signal , harder to jam . it 's not a single frequency .
that is not a problem , it can be done even with rotating frequency , wide - band frequency is not a problem at all , it really boils down to signal strength .
many small " hobby " drones are controlled by cellphone comm frequencies , so to jam them would be shutting down everybody 's phones , and other devices too . it 's also harder to jam spread - spectrum frequencies . then there are the rc model frequencies , etc , etc . btw , rc hobby planes are a type of drone , and they can carry fairly heavy payloads . many of the military 's drones derived from rc controlled hobby planes . some of the drones [[ORG]] built could carry grenades or larger explosive packages . some were quite large .
true , over the counter drones use set frequencies .... which are easily modified . what self respecting terrorist would use the out of the box channels ?
time to get the navair spike missile into production . it 's a " fire and forget " optically guided mini - missile , with a low cost compared to most guided missiles . it 's perfectly suited for these drones .
let 's do away with another fun toy / tool ... because there are some twisted enough to use them to destroy ... sounds like a solid plan . but wait , cars can carry bombs too , why are n't we regulating those off the market ... or planes ? ? ? we have seen what a plane can do ... you cannot regulate yourself into a safe place ... laws give consequence for acting incorrectly , they simply do not make anyone act the way they should ...
dummy , this article is n't talking about regulating drones , it 's about how to deal with them when one is detected . [[GPE]] airports have had several close encounters with small drones . the problem is detecting them approaching , and how to down them or jam them before they get close enough to detonate or drop a pound of anthrax or ricin .
no , you are highly limiting the scope of the discussion . if what you are saying is all the article was about there would not be further discussion in it about the usefulness of drones far outweighing the current risks there in .
scramble their control frequencies , watch them crash .
must be a [[NORP]] push for more regulation . wow , do they run scared all the time ? " [[ORG]] was able to confirm that some of the best - selling consumer / commercial drones – which are widely available in stores and on the internet - are indeed capable of carrying enough weight to deliver payloads that could do serious damage . " [[QUANTITY]] at best for a store purchased drone . is [[ORG]] available to a consumer . nope .
