and , here , boys and girls , is further demonstration of the subterranean oolite bubble subsidence , which now is becoming apparent in other places like [[GPE]] .
doggone ! wish i would have become involved in one of these ' scientific studies ' [[DATE]] . like most government programs they do n't seem to ever expire .
imagine all those poor oysters ...
with the advent of drones , no need for explorers to trudge miles for [[DATE]] on end to remote parts in hopes of discovering ancient sites . [[ORG]] mapped out in advance with precise locations , gps in flight . [[GPE]] takes the excitement and sense of adventure out of the equation , little left but for the digging , pilfering and cataloguing to begin . [[ORG]] would not be pleased .
you can almost make out the shuffleboard courts ! cool !
they were building earthan mounds [[DATE]] . yet up to the time the [[NORP]] came they were still stone age people . no wheel , no metal working of any sort , no beasts of burden . i always found it amazing that there was no progession at all .
if researchers would go offshore about 40 to [[QUANTITY]] , off [[LOC]] they would find much more of these things , the coast rises [[QUANTITY]] there , and it is know that the ocean has raisin [[QUANTITY]] in [[DATE]]
a [[DATE]] burial site found " below " [[LOC]] . so the rising sea level is nothing new and has nothing to do with global warming ? [[GPE]] .
cool !
what is so unique about a place where the people were singing , " ymca " , and " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " ? ;-) just kidding !
[[PERSON]] invented this village
in related news [[PERSON]] excitedly announced that her ancestral village has been located
find me bigfoot or this tech is being underutilized .
[[PRODUCT]] is incredible technology . they should use it to see if they can find any brains in [[NORP]] .
hmmm , walls and rising waters . must have been a chief trump and climate change back then too .
note there is a [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] . the fact that its underwater indicates sea levels have been rising for [[GPE]] .
its no joke people . sea level rise gon na get us all one day ..... not
ancient alien theorist believe : the beads were actually used by sasquatch to fuel his fleet of ufos .
an extention of [[ORG]] !
imagine it now : [[GPE]] , the sequel .
next will be claims of sacred religious sites . then comes the casinos and smoke shops .
those are obviously gigantic dog paw prints from prehistoric giant dino dogs put on earth by god to test us duuuuuh
so cool ! ! !
curiously scientists also found symbolic representations of a mouse 's head in several locations ...
maybe
nice find !
so that 's where puka shells came from !
" the ancient people of [[LOC]] started building mounds as early as [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] , experts say . " i guess that is why when the [[NORP]] arrived they were still in the stone age .
huh ? this scan in and the photos of the artifacts look like a bunch of random rocks to me . not seeing the rings . sorry .
i bet the people of that town where tired of the sky screaming socialist too !
[[DATE]] of looking and still nothing to give the tree huggers .
keep in mind that they were still immigrants from [[LOC]] , who crossed t he bering sea land bridge [[DATE]] .
[[PERSON]] grand father is from there
“ lasers ”
impossible ! ! ! ! [[GPE]] did n't discover [[GPE]] until the 1500 's ! ! ! obviously , fake news ! ! ! !
wow . so it 's true the ocean is rising . dang them climate deniers .
looks like a pile of dirt to me . but good enough for a government grant i suppose .
[[NORP]] camp fires put off too much co2 and caused the ice caps to melt and flooded the settlement . same thing is happening [[DATE]] with so much co2 that [[GPE]] is going underwater so say [[ORG]] .
a key fact was left out , ( unless i missed it ) , at what depth were these structures ?
reading some of these comments it seems some readers missed the part about this village being found on an island . an island called [[FAC]] which is as an island above the sea . though other villages have been discover under [[LOC]] off the [[GPE]] coast .
it was the farts of their pre - columbian cows that caused the water to rise ... don'cha know ...
it 's ok . they are still voting [[NORP]]
look closely , you can see the remnants of a old [[CARDINAL]] .
the village people .
so many fish up that way , probably why they chose there . plenty to eat
[[QUANTITY]] wide [[ORG]]
more proof the [[WORK_OF_ART]] is real !
if this is n't proof that global warming is fake i do n’t know what else is . you mean to tell me you ’re going to dig up something that old in that location and the most amazing thing you can determine from it is linkages to shell walls ?
funny how an ancient village on an island is still above sea level in [[LOC]] . yeah , i am pretty sure the oceans go up and down like lakes do . [[DATE]] are either hotter , colder , or long spells of drought . i am more worried about chemical pollution than global warming . that is where the [[NORP]] have missed the boat . we exhale [[PERSON]] , the earth releases huge amounts of methane and natural gas by itself . now putting fertilizer , gasoline , insecticides etc into our water supply and food chain is a travesty , but global warming and cooling gon na happen either way . [[NORP]] should have focused on tangible pollution , not c02 that we exhale . that is baloney .
said to be a thriving village at one time an [[NORP]] queen by the name of lie - awatha took the throne , soon after she enacted what was known as the witch doctor - for - all program . in [[DATE]] the residents had depleted all resources and turn to cannibalism , all hope gone the few remaining tribesmen left allowing the thick vegetation to reclaim the village .
well , this blows the claim of [[LOC]] 's recent warming and climate change to heck . proves the rising ocean levels have been happening over centuries .
you mean to tell me the earths ocean rose and covered these structures ? interesting [[ORG]] , is n't it .
[[PERSON]] remembers teaching them how to make beads .
read the headline again , there was a [[GPE]] village that is using drones and lasers . wow !
" “ as items of ritual significance , shell beads were intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms throughout eastern [[LOC]] starting in [[DATE]] ce . ” heh . i guess that explains how the [[NORP]] picked up [[GPE]] so cheaply --- they had glass ones .
boys , now find me a bigfoot .
we should do the right thing and give this land back to the [[NORP]] .
hmmm okay ...
was the fountain of youth there ?
why they use the term pre columbian when it pertains to the [[GPE]] is beyond me . [[GPE]] never set foot , here .
these village people were down south because of all the glaciers in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] where is was just too cold to live [ for some ] . heat good , cold bad .
[[GPE]] is an old red fishing hole i have fished at for [[DATE]] . it is at the entrance of [[GPE]] . the redfish migrate to [[FAC]] during the winter and hang out there until the water starts to warm . we launch our boat at [[ORG]] . this article mentions mounds . there are several large mounds [[QUANTITY]] high of oyster shells . we always were told it was where the [[NORP]] buried their dead on top of each other . the area is right next to [[LOC]] in [[GPE]] . lots of history in that area .
i thought it might be the " village " that [[PERSON]] said it takes to raise a child . the village that raised [[PERSON]] must have been equipped with [[CARDINAL]] helluva ugly stick .
looks like mounds of ancient sand that might have been anthills
i 'd like to see some actual evidence that these were homes for humans , cuz most like likely these were probably traps to catch sea creatures that get washed in with the tide ... hence the shells ... but lets now let logic cloud our thinking right ?
that was a pretty unique ancient village if they were using drones and lasers .
[[PERSON]] said the village was pretty rad back in [[DATE]] .
dang , if they only had all driven [[PERSON]] , they still might be above sea level .
the birthplace of ' [[WORK_OF_ART]]
i bet somehow in time for [[DATE]] all the ancient inhabitants are registered [[NORP]] and wind up voting in the election
[[PERSON]] and sea level rise combined with [[PERSON]] book on it convinced them to build the mounds and vote for [[NORP]] . look what it got them .
it is quite possible that due to the increase in sea level over [[DATE]] , this village originally was on the mainland , not an island .
[[ORG]] is creating a new golden age in archeological discovery all over the world ! cool and useful technology
maybe , just maybe this is obama 's homestead .
they would n't have died out if they had [[ORG]] - for - all .
being shells , maybe they thought they would float
so these people were sitting around , had rocks , trees and shells all over the place . and they decided to use [[ORG]] to make buildings . the smallest of all the material at their disposal . obviously liberals were in charge at the time .
the original [[PERSON]] 's island .
they also found the skeleton of a [[ORG]] greeter ...
can find this but not bigfoot ? maybe use this technology in the [[ORG]] ?
there were some homeless wandering around the area so they think [[PERSON]] pelosi was once ruler
" researchers led by [[PERSON]] , a doctoral student in anthropology , spotted [[CARDINAL]] “ residential spaces ” enclosed by walls of oyster shells up to [[QUANTITY]] high . " so they had walls back then too ?
their chief was the great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather of [[ORG]] , maybe ...
i wonder if they can use it to locate hillaries 33,000 missing emails .
i 've read some on [[PRODUCT]] cultures of [[NORP]] along the [[GPE]] coast . they were much taller than many of the inland indigenous people , possible because of their high protein sea food diet . this also occurred among [[LOC]] cultures .
if only the dinosaurs had not died off , the natives could have domesticated them and rode them to safety .
who was crying global warming [[DATE]] ? instead of beads , these folks should have been making canoes .
[[PERSON]] original homestead ?
lidar was used to find [[GPE]] of [[PRODUCT]] . i saw it on a documentary entitled " [[WORK_OF_ART]] . " great movie . very educational . i recommend it . :-)
ha ! that is not an ancient village ! that 's where they dumped all of the hanging chad [[DATE]] .
the beads were to be found later at a site in modern day [[GPE]] with a sabre tooth sign reading ' have some pity .... ' unfortunately that 's all that was left of the sign .
i ’m sensing [[PERSON]] here ...
headline should have read , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] by [[PERSON]] " the have proof that the oceans are rising since " in a separate project , archaeologists discovered an “ unprecedented ” [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] off the coast of [[GPE]] . "
" in a separate project , archaeologists discovered an “ unprecedented ” [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] off the coast of [[GPE]] . " so that area must have been above high tide [[DATE]] . see what global warming caused . [[GPE]] did it .
that 's cool
hold on , the water level has been the same for [[DATE]] ?
those liberal hippie bead industries of the big business liberals caused their global climate change . [[ORG]] should have passed the green sea shell bead act , no bead strings with a capacity of [[CARDINAL]] shells . did n't they have an anti - indigenous group to shell them back to the dinosaur age ?
all they had to do was ask rbg .... she would of told them what it was ....
looks as if the inhabitants had built walls around their homes as if to keep the [[LOC]] from flooding them ? were they experiencing high tides or global warming ?
you mean that the water level on earth was lower at some point in the distant path and that it has risen for possibly [[DATE]] ? maybe due to the [[LOC]] 's natural heating and cooling cycles ? you do n't say ?
probably a pretty good simple life . good climate , plenty food , no [[NORP]] . awe ! what a life !
" there are things we do n't know we do n't know . " - [[PERSON]]
lidar is amazing technology , its amazing how many discoveries lidar has been central in .
[[ORG]] , they found no evidence of the oil spill . eaten by microbes .
[[PERSON]] is flying down to her stake claim on the shells .
so the oil spill did not end civilization as we know it .
they must have been really good at holding their breath to live like that . amazing .
[[NORP]] are wrong again climate change is their pyramid scheme and you are not included .
law enforcement are using a similar detection device to root out misinformation : liars .
probably moved out when they realized all the liberal [[NORP]] came to [[GPE]] . the [[NORP]] naturally ruined it [[DATE]] .
great find . a better [[NORP]] drone footage would be over the villages around sunset .
looks like [[PERSON]] did n't stop the sea 's from rising so soon lol
drones and lasers cause climate change . ~aoc
[[PERSON]] invented [[ORG]] .
[[NORP]] , [[CARDINAL]] to [[DATE]] lived in [[GPE]] too !
folks , this was on land , not underwater .
maxine could have taken them right to it if they had only asked . she grew up there !
i know what happened : the natives used so many oyster shells ( presumably they ate the oysters [[ORDINAL]] ) to build their homes , that the ocean level rose and flooded the village . [[PERSON]] to be learned : do not eat oysters .
[[PERSON]] caused seas to rise . [[ORG]] .
there are many more cities underwater . the next ice age will bring them to light and rewrite history .
what is the [[ORDINAL]] century c.e. ?
did they find evidence of [[PERSON]] " [[WORK_OF_ART]] being an [[NORP]] yet ?
" ... shell beads were intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms throughout eastern [[LOC]] starting in [[DATE]] ce . " i wonder what commodity is " intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms " [[DATE]] ?
man has been globetrotters long before [[ORG]] will admit !
very curious . here are pre - colum , [[NORP]] artifacts , evidently a village , still there on the coastline while we have [[DATE]] left until the planate destroys itself due to man . we are on our [[ORDINAL]] or [[ORDINAL]] cycle of " [[DATE]] left . " " when will people stop believing this hyper - tripe of global climate change , or global warming , or global cooling or whater the hysteria of the day is ? ? just curious .....................
fascinating stuff , to me anyway . cool
due to earths tectonic plate movement and subduction .. we have no idea how many civilizations or life has been here .. and there is no way to ever know ..
put some lasers to work on the [[NORP]] cartels .
" the village on [[GPE]] dates back to between a.d. 900 and 1200 " sorry evolutionists ; not 900 bn to [[CARDINAL]] bn years ago , so nothing here for you .... ;d
the [[NORP]] cultures of the [[LOC]] and southeast [[GPE]] were a lot more advanced than we usually think .
