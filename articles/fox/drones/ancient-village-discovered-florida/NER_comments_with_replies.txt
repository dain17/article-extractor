and , here , boys and girls , is further demonstration of the subterranean oolite bubble subsidence , which now is becoming apparent in other places like [[GPE]] .
doggone ! wish i would have become involved in one of these ' scientific studies ' [[DATE]] . like most government programs they do n't seem to ever expire .
imagine all those poor oysters ...
with the advent of drones , no need for explorers to trudge miles for [[DATE]] on end to remote parts in hopes of discovering ancient sites . [[ORG]] mapped out in advance with precise locations , gps in flight . [[GPE]] takes the excitement and sense of adventure out of the equation , little left but for the digging , pilfering and cataloguing to begin . [[ORG]] would not be pleased .
you can almost make out the shuffleboard courts ! cool !
scateboard ramps
they were building earthan mounds [[DATE]] . yet up to the time the [[NORP]] came they were still stone age people . no wheel , no metal working of any sort , no beasts of burden . i always found it amazing that there was no progession at all .
if researchers would go offshore about 40 to [[QUANTITY]] , off [[LOC]] they would find much more of these things , the coast rises [[QUANTITY]] there , and it is know that the ocean has raisin [[QUANTITY]] in [[DATE]]
' raisin ' ?
did you get the point
so another inch in [[DATE]] is nothing
right but it 's more like 6 inches
lol , really ? should n't world coastlines be flooded out on a permanent basis ? it is not happening
a [[DATE]] burial site found " below " [[LOC]] . so the rising sea level is nothing new and has nothing to do with global warming ? [[GPE]] .
it has rose [[QUANTITY]] in [[DATE]]
the ocean only appears to rise where the land subsides .
so the land bridge in the being strait sunk , along with the land around what is now the sea of [[GPE]] , and filled the valley of what is the black sea , and along the coast of [[GPE]] . i have catch mammon bones in [[QUANTITY]] of water along the coast there along with old petrified trees . maybe you need to read and live a different life , city boy
probably does have something to do with global warming , but this is yet more evidence that climate cycles have been going on for a long , long time ( i.e. we ai n't the cause ) ..
cool !
what is so unique about a place where the people were singing , " ymca " , and " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " ? ;-) just kidding !
[[PERSON]] invented this village
why [[PERSON]] ?
in related news [[PERSON]] excitedly announced that her ancestral village has been located
find me bigfoot or this tech is being underutilized .
[[PRODUCT]] is incredible technology . they should use it to see if they can find any brains in [[NORP]] .
[[PRODUCT]] ...
mission impossible .
hmmm , walls and rising waters . must have been a chief trump and climate change back then too .
if you did not have walls back then , you died . similar to today but less screaming hordes with spears now .
note there is a [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] . the fact that its underwater indicates sea levels have been rising for [[GPE]] .
that is very interesting because most geological evidence shows that the sea level was actually [[QUANTITY]] years ago . this area may be subsiding .
you beat me to it .
thumbs up for ya !
its no joke people . sea level rise gon na get us all one day ..... not
i saw that movie , we slowly turn into fish people ( muto ) , we still have boats and [[EVENT]] is run by a crazy guy .
my favorite part was when he turned his head too quickly and his new eyeball flew out ! lol
ancient alien theorist believe : the beads were actually used by sasquatch to fuel his fleet of ufos .
an extention of [[ORG]] !
wrong location
wrong noun .
imagine it now : [[GPE]] , the sequel .
as we [[PERSON]] as that show is , there is a fascinating psychological observation to made that one can dig holes over and over again and not find anything nor realistically expect to find anything , and still make a good wage doing nothing productive on tv for [[DATE]] . it must be how [[ORG]] stays in business .
next will be claims of sacred religious sites . then comes the casinos and smoke shops .
not where that island is at
those are obviously gigantic dog paw prints from prehistoric giant dino dogs put on earth by god to test us duuuuuh
so cool ! ! !
curiously scientists also found symbolic representations of a mouse 's head in several locations ...
maybe
nice find !
so that 's where puka shells came from !
" the ancient people of [[LOC]] started building mounds as early as [[CARDINAL]] [[GPE]] , experts say . " i guess that is why when the [[NORP]] arrived they were still in the stone age .
huh ? this scan in and the photos of the artifacts look like a bunch of random rocks to me . not seeing the rings . sorry .
i bet the people of that town where tired of the sky screaming socialist too !
[[DATE]] of looking and still nothing to give the tree huggers .
i like to give tree huggers termites .
keep in mind that they were still immigrants from [[LOC]] , who crossed t he bering sea land bridge [[DATE]] .
really ? you were there ? how about [[ORG]] , which did not come from that direction .
was n't [[PERSON]] brother or was he on [[PERSON]] ? i 'm certain he had a guest appearance on [[GPE]] .
drop the ocean levels [[CARDINAL]] ft and you can walk to every continent of the world , even [[GPE]] , [[PERSON]]
[[PERSON]] grand father is from there
“ lasers ”
impossible ! ! ! ! [[GPE]] did n't discover [[GPE]] until the 1500 's ! ! ! obviously , fake news ! ! ! !
[[ORG]] did n't discover [[GPE]] .
we just ended the indigenous stone age . something they should be thankful for
apparently , you have n't been to [[GPE]] , [[GPE]]
[[PERSON]] did ...
wow . so it 's true the ocean is rising . dang them climate deniers .
yes and apparently it 's been doing so since well before the development of automobiles and power plants .
yep , that 's why [[GPE]] ( [[ORG]] ) is [[QUANTITY]] below sea level now . oh wait , sorry , it is nearly sea level and has been since recorded history !
or even people and cows .
or liberal people and cows .
or is the land sinking , those pesky geologists could be right too ...
yet the ocean used to be in [[GPE]] and western [[GPE]] , so i guess the sea levels have also gone down ... weird !
geology amiright ? who knew techtonic shifts can also thrust land upward as well as downward !
looks like a pile of dirt to me . but good enough for a government grant i suppose .
lol , right !
[[NORP]] camp fires put off too much co2 and caused the ice caps to melt and flooded the settlement . same thing is happening [[DATE]] with so much co2 that [[GPE]] is going underwater so say [[ORG]] .
a key fact was left out , ( unless i missed it ) , at what depth were these structures ?
most likely these are islands . the lidar sees through vegetation . probably covered by mangroves
on an island above the water .
reading some of these comments it seems some readers missed the part about this village being found on an island . an island called [[FAC]] which is as an island above the sea . though other villages have been discover under [[LOC]] off the [[GPE]] coast .
it was the farts of their pre - columbian cows that caused the water to rise ... don'cha know ...
it 's ok . they are still voting [[NORP]]
look closely , you can see the remnants of a old [[CARDINAL]] .
the village people .
so many fish up that way , probably why they chose there . plenty to eat
plus the local [[GPE]] girls were easy .
[[QUANTITY]] wide [[ORG]]
that 's smaller than the average house perimeter .
more proof the [[WORK_OF_ART]] is real !
so are comic books !
why bring the [[WORK_OF_ART]] into this ?
jesus is in that person 's head , and he / she ca n't get him out . ;)
if this is n't proof that global warming is fake i do n’t know what else is . you mean to tell me you ’re going to dig up something that old in that location and the most amazing thing you can determine from it is linkages to shell walls ?
funny how an ancient village on an island is still above sea level in [[LOC]] . yeah , i am pretty sure the oceans go up and down like lakes do . [[DATE]] are either hotter , colder , or long spells of drought . i am more worried about chemical pollution than global warming . that is where the [[NORP]] have missed the boat . we exhale [[PERSON]] , the earth releases huge amounts of methane and natural gas by itself . now putting fertilizer , gasoline , insecticides etc into our water supply and food chain is a travesty , but global warming and cooling gon na happen either way . [[NORP]] should have focused on tangible pollution , not c02 that we exhale . that is baloney .
come on , stop it . we all know climate change science is real , that 's why every prediction has been right for [[DATE]] . [[DATE]] it rained and [[DATE]] before that it was n't raining ! obvious signs of climate change .
see , i would be more concerned with what industrial , commercial , and human caused chemicals that are in that rain . not worried about the co2 we exhale .
said to be a thriving village at one time an [[NORP]] queen by the name of lie - awatha took the throne , soon after she enacted what was known as the witch doctor - for - all program . in [[DATE]] the residents had depleted all resources and turn to cannibalism , all hope gone the few remaining tribesmen left allowing the thick vegetation to reclaim the village .
[[ORG]] 's meemaw told her that her ancestors lived there once .
well , this blows the claim of [[LOC]] 's recent warming and climate change to heck . proves the rising ocean levels have been happening over centuries .
how so , sand flats slowly sink into the ocean to this day . go look at the [[LOC]] river delta for current evidence of sinking sand at the oceans edge .
sorry , the delta used to grow from the silt deposits from the river , it only reversed after [[ORG]] dug a deep and wide ship channel that then washed the silt deep into the [[LOC]] instead of depositing it on the shoreline .
rivers move , the sand deposits sink here and increase elsewhere , the only reason the [[GPE]] quit moving was human intervention in [[DATE]] . also sand can deposit from currents , currents also shift , when currents are gone , those deposits also sink .
you mean to tell me the earths ocean rose and covered these structures ? interesting [[ORG]] , is n't it .
not this one . it was found on an island .
[[PERSON]] remembers teaching them how to make beads .
chief corn pop took him under his wing .
read the headline again , there was a [[GPE]] village that is using drones and lasers . wow !
yes indeed , since educated people are now discriminated against they hire more " diverse " writers and change our language to fit them .
" “ as items of ritual significance , shell beads were intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms throughout eastern [[LOC]] starting in [[DATE]] ce . ” heh . i guess that explains how the [[NORP]] picked up [[GPE]] so cheaply --- they had glass ones .
boys , now find me a bigfoot .
we should do the right thing and give this land back to the [[NORP]] .
hmmm okay ...
was the fountain of youth there ?
it ran out of water , that 's why they are all dead .
why they use the term pre columbian when it pertains to the [[GPE]] is beyond me . [[GPE]] never set foot , here .
perhaps " [[WORK_OF_ART]] " would be more appropriate .
you want to give him credit for something that was already found by some [[NORP]] ?
these village people were down south because of all the glaciers in [[GPE]] and [[GPE]] where is was just too cold to live [ for some ] . heat good , cold bad .
[[GPE]] is an old red fishing hole i have fished at for [[DATE]] . it is at the entrance of [[GPE]] . the redfish migrate to [[FAC]] during the winter and hang out there until the water starts to warm . we launch our boat at [[ORG]] . this article mentions mounds . there are several large mounds [[QUANTITY]] high of oyster shells . we always were told it was where the [[NORP]] buried their dead on top of each other . the area is right next to [[LOC]] in [[GPE]] . lots of history in that area .
i thought it might be the " village " that [[PERSON]] said it takes to raise a child . the village that raised [[PERSON]] must have been equipped with [[CARDINAL]] helluva ugly stick .
back in the 90s we used to say that [[PERSON]] was so ugly cuz [[PERSON]] was her dad ... 😂
good one !
i think you mean , [[PERSON]] . stop spreading that fake news
nope . [[PERSON]] wrote a book on it .
looks like mounds of ancient sand that might have been anthills
[[GPE]] aints in [[ORG]] .
i 'd like to see some actual evidence that these were homes for humans , cuz most like likely these were probably traps to catch sea creatures that get washed in with the tide ... hence the shells ... but lets now let logic cloud our thinking right ?
some walls [[QUANTITY]] high .
that was a pretty unique ancient village if they were using drones and lasers .
[[PERSON]] said the village was pretty rad back in [[DATE]] .
dang , if they only had all driven [[PERSON]] , they still might be above sea level .
the birthplace of ' [[WORK_OF_ART]]
i bet somehow in time for [[DATE]] all the ancient inhabitants are registered [[NORP]] and wind up voting in the election
[[PERSON]] and sea level rise combined with [[PERSON]] book on it convinced them to build the mounds and vote for [[NORP]] . look what it got them .
it is quite possible that due to the increase in sea level over [[DATE]] , this village originally was on the mainland , not an island .
[[NORP]] caused global warming
they could n't have been [[NORP]] because [[GPE]] did n't invent that [ without [[PERSON]] help ] until [[DATE]] or so . they were just indigenous village bead hippies .
uh , [[PERSON]] is what [[GPE]] was named after ...
technically you 're right , but you probably the only one whose head it went over .
[[ORG]] is creating a new golden age in archeological discovery all over the world ! cool and useful technology
maybe , just maybe this is obama 's homestead .
this is [[GPE]] , not [[GPE]] .
as in nobody is available to contradict obamas village birth certificate since they do n't exist anymore .
yep , and the one woman that could in the [[GPE]] went down in a plane crash in [[GPE]] during [[GPE]] ’s birth certificate controversy .
they would n't have died out if they had [[ORG]] - for - all .
being shells , maybe they thought they would float
so these people were sitting around , had rocks , trees and shells all over the place . and they decided to use [[ORG]] to make buildings . the smallest of all the material at their disposal . obviously liberals were in charge at the time .
similar structures are found in other places in [[GPE]] as well . oyster shells are a very abundant material in that region . what rocks are there in [[GPE]] that could be used for structures ? a google search about using palm trees : " some may want to use it -- the [[NORP]] supposedly did long ago and [[ORG]] built bunkers of palm trees in [[LOC]] -- but it is hard to find many buildings today made of the palm logs . for [[CARDINAL]] thing , palm logs consist of packed fibers like grasses which runs parallel to the length of the stem so boards ca n't be made out of them . a palm log will tear up a saw blade and dull a chainsaw , [[ORG]] said . if moisture gets to the middle , the logs will rot from the inside out . "
triggered ... [[ORG]]
the original [[PERSON]] 's island .
they also found the skeleton of a [[ORG]] greeter ...
can find this but not bigfoot ? maybe use this technology in the [[ORG]] ?
big foot has been found , she lives in [[GPE]] , ny .
[[PERSON]] has been looking for [[PERSON]] for [[DATE]] and has found nothing .
cmon , i saw [[CARDINAL]] different bigfoots on [[DATE]] nite ..
there were some homeless wandering around the area so they think [[PERSON]] pelosi was once ruler
" researchers led by [[PERSON]] , a doctoral student in anthropology , spotted [[CARDINAL]] “ residential spaces ” enclosed by walls of oyster shells up to [[QUANTITY]] high . " so they had walls back then too ?
that was before [[NORP]] .
their chief was the great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather of [[ORG]] , maybe ...
[[CARDINAL]] of [[PERSON]] warrens relatives ?
no that 's [[PERSON]] , father of [[GPE]] , cousin to princess pokemon .......................
i wonder if they can use it to locate hillaries 33,000 missing emails .
i 've read some on [[PRODUCT]] cultures of [[NORP]] along the [[GPE]] coast . they were much taller than many of the inland indigenous people , possible because of their high protein sea food diet . this also occurred among [[LOC]] cultures .
if only the dinosaurs had not died off , the natives could have domesticated them and rode them to safety .
who was crying global warming [[DATE]] ? instead of beads , these folks should have been making canoes .
[[PERSON]] original homestead ?
lidar was used to find [[GPE]] of [[PRODUCT]] . i saw it on a documentary entitled " [[WORK_OF_ART]] . " great movie . very educational . i recommend it . :-)
ha ! that is not an ancient village ! that 's where they dumped all of the hanging chad [[DATE]] .
the beads were to be found later at a site in modern day [[GPE]] with a sabre tooth sign reading ' have some pity .... ' unfortunately that 's all that was left of the sign .
i ’m sensing [[PERSON]] here ...
headline should have read , " [[WORK_OF_ART]] by [[PERSON]] " the have proof that the oceans are rising since " in a separate project , archaeologists discovered an “ unprecedented ” [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] off the coast of [[GPE]] . "
i like it that you 're clearly not one to just assume things ...
" in a separate project , archaeologists discovered an “ unprecedented ” [[DATE]] [[NORP]] burial site beneath [[LOC]] off the coast of [[GPE]] . " so that area must have been above high tide [[DATE]] . see what global warming caused . [[GPE]] did it .
that 's cool
hold on , the water level has been the same for [[DATE]] ?
[[PERSON]] jumped in the ocean and the water level rose enough to bury it .
those liberal hippie bead industries of the big business liberals caused their global climate change . [[ORG]] should have passed the green sea shell bead act , no bead strings with a capacity of [[CARDINAL]] shells . did n't they have an anti - indigenous group to shell them back to the dinosaur age ?
all they had to do was ask rbg .... she would of told them what it was ....
looks as if the inhabitants had built walls around their homes as if to keep the [[LOC]] from flooding them ? were they experiencing high tides or global warming ?
these were fish traps , not homes ... but poor journalism got in the way .
no , immigrants . from [[LOC]] in their case .
you mean that the water level on earth was lower at some point in the distant path and that it has risen for possibly [[DATE]] ? maybe due to the [[LOC]] 's natural heating and cooling cycles ? you do n't say ?
probably a pretty good simple life . good climate , plenty food , no [[NORP]] . awe ! what a life !
a study showed the [[ORG]] had more free time than modern man .
no internet ... gad , a horrible existence . ;-)
they did n't have email .
heavenly
" there are things we do n't know we do n't know . " - [[PERSON]]
lidar is amazing technology , its amazing how many discoveries lidar has been central in .
it 's more amazing they are using it to study the impact of a oil spill that has recovered so well they have to search for it with a lazer device .
searching on land for the oil spill .
[[ORG]] , they found no evidence of the oil spill . eaten by microbes .
everything eats something given enough time .
just ask [[PERSON]] .
[[PERSON]] !
[[PERSON]] is flying down to her stake claim on the shells .
no one wants to see [[PERSON]] 's clam
if she collects a few strands of beads , she can trade the lot of them to de blasio for [[LOC]] . he 's sucker for bling .
so the oil spill did not end civilization as we know it .
they must have been really good at holding their breath to live like that . amazing .
[[NORP]] are wrong again climate change is their pyramid scheme and you are not included .
law enforcement are using a similar detection device to root out misinformation : liars .
probably moved out when they realized all the liberal [[NORP]] came to [[GPE]] . the [[NORP]] naturally ruined it [[DATE]] .
great find . a better [[NORP]] drone footage would be over the villages around sunset .
yea ! they have the highest [[ORG]] rate in the country .
looks like [[PERSON]] did n't stop the sea 's from rising so soon lol
drones and lasers cause climate change . ~aoc
[[PERSON]] invented [[ORG]] .
drop the " d " and i would agree :> )
i 'm pretty sure [[PERSON]] wants the " d " as well .
sad that [[NORP]] [[DATE]] make him look like a genius
[[NORP]] , [[CARDINAL]] to [[DATE]] lived in [[GPE]] too !
folks , this was on land , not underwater .
it is now ... duh !
maxine could have taken them right to it if they had only asked . she grew up there !
i know what happened : the natives used so many oyster shells ( presumably they ate the oysters [[ORDINAL]] ) to build their homes , that the ocean level rose and flooded the village . [[PERSON]] to be learned : do not eat oysters .
this is an island .
[[PERSON]] caused seas to rise . [[ORG]] .
there are many more cities underwater . the next ice age will bring them to light and rewrite history .
what is the [[ORDINAL]] century c.e. ?
common era
did they find evidence of [[PERSON]] " [[WORK_OF_ART]] being an [[NORP]] yet ?
" ... shell beads were intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms throughout eastern [[LOC]] starting in [[DATE]] ce . " i wonder what commodity is " intrinsic to the rise of complex chiefdoms " [[DATE]] ?
[[ORG]] shoes and smart phones
[[ORG]]
at least the shell beads are [[ORG]]
each modest shell bead was backed by [[ORG]] of [[CARDINAL]] prettier shell beads in [[FAC]] of [[ORG]] .
yeah .
man has been globetrotters long before [[ORG]] will admit !
throwing a sphere through a hoop has intrigued man for [[DATE]] .
look into a man named [[PERSON]] . he definitely is attempting to buck conventional thinking . his book [[WORK_OF_ART]] . the recent discovery of a massive comet / asteroid impact in [[GPE]] pretty much solidifies his theory .
pseudoscience is fun !
pseudoscience ? what s pseudo about it ?
very curious . here are pre - colum , [[NORP]] artifacts , evidently a village , still there on the coastline while we have [[DATE]] left until the planate destroys itself due to man . we are on our [[ORDINAL]] or [[ORDINAL]] cycle of " [[DATE]] left . " " when will people stop believing this hyper - tripe of global climate change , or global warming , or global cooling or whater the hysteria of the day is ? ? just curious .....................
fascinating stuff , to me anyway . cool
due to earths tectonic plate movement and subduction .. we have no idea how many civilizations or life has been here .. and there is no way to ever know ..
you think they selectively settled places that have been destroyed by tectonic plate movement and avoided those places that have much longer geologic histories ? i do n't think that experts that know about such things consider that much of a possibility ...
oh come on ... we have a clear progression of life forms from fossil record from about 3 billion years until the present .. and yes , tectonic plate movement could hide some unexpected jewel .. but not over the time frame of any possible intelligent humanoid life .
put some lasers to work on the [[NORP]] cartels .
" the village on [[GPE]] dates back to between a.d. 900 and 1200 " sorry evolutionists ; not 900 bn to [[CARDINAL]] bn years ago , so nothing here for you .... ;d
the [[NORP]] cultures of the [[LOC]] and southeast [[GPE]] were a lot more advanced than we usually think .
