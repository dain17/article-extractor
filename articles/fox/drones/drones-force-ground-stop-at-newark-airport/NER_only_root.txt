guess what [[PERSON]] invented ?
so … was there a drone or not ? my drone drains its battery with all of the flashing lights on it and things like that are noticeable even more so at an airport . but the thing that gets me thinking about it is that this , the [[ORDINAL]] thing i 've read about it , all fail to get past the " well , this one pilot who flies for this [[CARDINAL]] airline said … " except there is no known pilot or airline the pilot flies for who saw a drone on [[DATE]] . no one on the ground reported one . see how hard it can be to be a critical thinker ?
claims ? was there ever a reason to doubt the words of a pilot in the air with passenger 's safety being put at risk by a drone nearby ? it happened . do something about it .
this is nothing . wait until [[ORG]] puts [[CARDINAL]] of these in the air and they start getting hijacked by hackers !
since people ca n't play nicely with their toys here is what should be done . all drones should be required to have a valid vin , just like a motor vehicle . all drones should require registration and license that would be renewed [[DATE]] . the license would need to be transferred any time the drone changes ownership . a registration number must be visible on the drone . operating an unregistered drone would be subject to a fine , just like operating an aircraft without registration . there is a device that looks something like a gun used to capture drones . the radio signal between the drone and controller is not all that secure . when pointed at a drone the operator can take full control . and safely land the drone . since the drone would be registered , the owner could be tracked down and fined .
what 's everyone droning on and on about ?
lasers and drones -- small prices for big hazards . makes the age - old knock of commercial airline pilots against general aviation violating their airspace seem insignificant .
where is the blurry , shaky video of it ?
i wish journalists would proofread their stories . this story is unclear as to what happened . what is a ground stop ? if the drone was at [[QUANTITY]] , how was it within [[QUANTITY]] of a plane that is at a ground stop ?
now , when drones are outlawed or require training and expensive permits , we will all remember why lawmakers deemed it so .
drones should have vin numbers like cars .
what 's stopping a terrorist from bringing down a plane in a high populated area ...
anti - drone devices have existed for [[DATE]] . airports simply need to invest in them . it 's like crying about a headache with a bottle of tylenol sitting next to you .
drones of any size are a menace to aviation . it 's not a matter of if an accident will happen , but when .
someone better act now . it 's only a matter of time until a $ [[MONEY]] toy takes out an aircraft .
the common complaint is that these things are fast to get away - they do their thing , and they 're gone . no responder is going to catch them at the scene ; you have to tag or record them as it happens , then track them down . or , have an airplane - safe instant disabler or barrier to prevent airspace breach .
liberals being terrorist with their toys .
maby it 's et
find the frequencies they use and equip airports with a low - power " white noise " transmitter at those freqs . mandate that all civilian drones must be built to use those freqs . maybe not a complete solution - but it 's a start ...
tracking technology to find the control transmitter must exist . needs to be disseminated to potential danger areas such as airports ( and the airport police ) .
just have drones fly vectors . have to communicate with local air traffic if you want to fly near airport . why do n't they do this ? then if in violation you would hold the person responsible . i do n't know much about these things but maybe it would help as this seems to be happening more often
we never had this problem with rc planes and helicopters because drones are too easy to fly . a [[DATE]] can fly [[CARDINAL]] with [[TIME]] of training . they should install an [[ORG]] style chip in every drone that will show up on [[ORG]] screens so they will know exactly where it is and it 's registered serial number , just like a transponder in an airplane .
