just a thought . expedition spokesman states the expedition , equipped with steel hulled ice breakers may or may be able to reach the point a wooden19th century was able to reach over [[DATE]] because of ...... pack ice . i understand such ice moves about . but all we hear about is how [[LOC]] ice is disappearing ? ? ? ? ? ?
ya , so they have now found this ship and it was n't totaiiy crushed / destroyed and appears to be in remarkable condition upright on the bottom . i 'd like to know how hard it would be to raise it - other than the extreme depth , it does not look like it would be difficult .
[[ORG]] photo . it almost looks like a negative , but you know the ice is white . .
wait , i thought there was n't any more ice down there .
[[ORG]] and crew , what an adventure ! how tough these guys were . rowing miles upon miles in an open boat with just the water soaked coats , in raging frozen seas . then hiking over a tall mountain to reach the only other humans for [[QUANTITY]] in the same old boots and frozen garments , hoping to be rescued by whalers on a tiny island . do they make them like that anymore ?
endurance was the [[ORDINAL]] book i remember reading , in earnest , from cover to cover as a boy . it sits on my bookshelf to this day . as far a why would they be looking for the crumbled remains ? [[ORG]] women with big & wonderful toys . who would n't be interested ? i also suspect that developing tech . is being used to explore the depths in our never ending fascination with our past . no doubt there is a number of data collecting studies happening . beam me up [[PERSON]] .
[[CARDINAL]] of the most amazing stories i â€™ve ever read .
all this money being spent , and what 's the point ?
when they find her she 'll be bits and pieces , the sad remains of a once graceful vessel laying in the cold dark depths ...
ah , for just one time i would take the northwest passage to find the hand of [[PERSON]] for [[LOC]] tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage and make a northwest passage to the sea westward from [[FAC]] tis there ' twas said to lie the sea route to the orient for which so many died seeking gold and glory , leaving weathered , broken bones and a long - forgotten lonely cairn of stones [[DATE]] thereafter i take passage overland in the footsteps of brave kelso where his " sea of flowers " began watching cities rise before me then behind me sink again this tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain and through [[TIME]] , behind the wheel the mileage clicking west i think upon [[LOC]] , [[PERSON]] and the rest who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me to race the roaring [[PERSON]] to the sea how then am i so different from the first men through this way ? like them , i left a settled life i threw it all away to seek a northwest passage at the call of many men to find there but the road back home again ah , for just one time i would take the northwest passage to find the hand of [[PERSON]] for [[LOC]] tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage and make a northwest passage to the sea .
ok , i 'll bite . why ? it 's not like there is any mystery here .
[[PERSON]] ( paraphrased ) - if ever you are in need of good leadership , pray that [[ORG]] is your leader .
