I can give you about ten million reasons not to hurt al queda. I can give you about 80 million reasons not to hurt China. The ones that need to pay are the American taxpayers. We need to end all these tax cuts of Trump and load up new taxes on greedy Americans. Everyone needs to pay their fair share. The more productive you are the more you can afford to pay for the less productive. Donald Trump’s hate cant be allowed to force cheap gasoline prices. They were 4.50 a gallon 4 years ago but we were propping up our friends in Iran and Russia. It’s unfair that America now is producing its own oil and only pays $1.80 per gallon for gas. How do you think that makes Saudi Arabia princes and other Mid East oil producers feel.? Let’s right this ship and get democrats controlling gas prices. Save the planet. Republicans will destroy everything with fracking and coal and manufacturing things in America. People overseas need jobs too. Democrats keep those jobs there so we have somebody to trade with. \nLet’s open the borders and give free healthcare to the world. There are a lot of sick people and we can afford to help them out just a small raise in taxes provides a lot of health care   And don’t get me started on human trafficking, we all know these girls wanted it.
