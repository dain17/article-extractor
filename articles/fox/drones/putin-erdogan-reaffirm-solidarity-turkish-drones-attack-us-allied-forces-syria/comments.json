I guess Obama supporters like YOU agree with their decision. I assume after that 'brilliant move' by Obama's administration and the refusal to sell the Patriot missile systems to Turkey when PKK/YPG, ISIS and Syrian government army were lobbing missiles onto Turkish territory they felt betrayed by one of their closest ally. Now they produce most of their defense systems, they don't blindly follow anyone anymore and to them it's Turkey first. Just like it used to be America first up until 2 years ago. Trump was on the verge to bring Turkey back into our sphere of influence and friendship, against liberal agenda. I hope he finishes the job when he comes back to Whitehouse.",

They've been protecting NATO and Europe's southern border for the last 70 years. Without Turkey protecting Europe and NATO, millions of refugees would be busting through the Europe's borders, we would lose control of Caucuses region, Russia and China would control the whole Middle East, Egypt, the whole North Africa all the way to Spain and most of Eastern Europe countries would switch sides to Russia including Greece. That one country (Turkey) that Fox News liberals and Obama/Hillary enthusiasts love to trash is pretty much stopping this from happening. Instead of trying to bring Turkey back to our side more and breaking Obama's era of US - PKK/YPG terrorist relationship we are still going the opposite way. Arming the people that we also designated as terrorist is not the way to go. Imagine if Mexico decided to arm and train ISIS to help them with cartels. How long until we invade Mexico......2 minutes, 3 minutes......",

That one country (Turkey) that Fox News liberals and Obama/Hillary enthusiasts love to trash is pretty much stopping this from happening. Instead of trying to bring Turkey back to our side more and breaking Obama's era of US - PKK/YPG terrorist relationship we are still going the opposite way. Arming the people that we also designated as terrorist is not the way to go. Imagine if Mexico decided to arm and train ISIS to help them with cartels.
