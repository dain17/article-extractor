$ [[MONEY]] for earbuds . my hearing ai n't that good .
on my second i phone and the problems still abound and just about the time i recover from the [[ORG]] dumping everything to get factory defaults to return another problem jumps up , this time it 's voice clipping . i 'm looking forward to [[PERSON]] gates offering an operating system that does n't crash and has built in , self supporting malware and anti virus . why is a product offered with built in flaws ? like buying a [[ORG]] without wheels . i 'm 80 btw and do n't need the aggravation !
my current phone has this one really great feature that i use almost exclusively . i type in a series of numbers ( usually [[CARDINAL]] ) , press a button , and shazam . . . there is somebody on the other end that i need to talk to . it 's a wonderful feature , really .
wow ... this is more an ad for the most expensive useless gadgets . what 's your commision ? ? ?
did you say " best " or " most expensive " ?
shiny beads for shallow people
it just does n't take much to satisfy simple minds now [[DATE]] . well , takes spending [[CARDINAL]] times what a product is really worth , but keep it up . all of you who ca n't resist buying these newer model toys at crazy high prices are doing a really good job at fueling our retirements . too bad you 'll never get to experience that .
you average [[PERSON]] will be able to afford everything here . sheeesh
anything that real people can afford ?
google pixel 3 > any [[ORG]]
there is still very minimal true 4k content right now . [[PERSON]] pointless to upgrade at these prices .
did you see these prices ! specially the earbuds ......
you need to get the [[ORG]] products as soon as you can so you can get into the class action lawsuit on the faked screen sizes and screen resolution .
quick ! run out and buy it all for [[DATE]] . do n't forget to leave all the boxes at the curb so thieves know what house to hit !
hey ! ! ! i 'm the [[ORDINAL]] to comment - woo hoo ! i do n't want my tv to scan my droid device and share the password - all set with that amount of laziness oh , wait , i do n't own a droid - does that mean i should not buy [[ORG]] ?
you could have [[CARDINAL]] people do a top [[CARDINAL]] list , and you 'd get [[CARDINAL]] different list .
