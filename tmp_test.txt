0	1	0	the other thing that is completely ignored by those who believe climate change is all man-made is the massive amount of co2 that is introduced to the atmosphere from volcanic activity. the tonga volcano spewed a whole yearâ€™s worth equivalent of man-made co2 just in one month last january.
1	1	0	vaporized water up into the upper atmosphere..which is causing the excessive heat waves and drought
2	1	0	and i have yet to see a humidity reading associated with the temperature readings.  you cannot calculate the real heat energy without both.
3	1	0	it wouldn't so up ..if the water was ejected..into upper atmosphere look up at the sky don't you see the strata clouds blanketing the upper sky ..you can see i especially at sunset ..
4	1	0	da
5	1	0	a contributing factor, but the problem is the co2.
6	1	0	that's the orthodox climate change answer but actually water vapor has more effect because there is so much more of it in the atmosphere than co2.  of course the climate crowd would be laughed out of town if they proposed limiting water vapor so their high priests have declared co2 as the source of the peoblem and anyone who doubts a heretic.
7	1	0	no, that's the answer that the science supports. there is no a human caused release of water vapor that the water cycle cannot keep up with causing water to build up in the atmosphere.  this is however a human cased release of co2 that is causing the carbon cycle to fall behind which is why co2 levels are rising. the people that would be laughed out of town are the people trying to use the water vapor talking point alright, and they'll be laughed at by people who understand how the science works :d
8	1	0	also have the increased tilt of the earth which weakens the magnetosphere.  that is a huge part of global warming, but tree huggers will never admit to that.  less than 1% of global warming is caused by humans.  can we do better?  yes, but we do not have to be so dramatic about it.
9	1	0	except you don't know what you're talking about, but science deniers rarely do.  volcanic activity and the decay of organic matter are the two major contributing factors for natural co2. we're completely and totally aware of this in climate science, and we take that into account.  the carbon cycle works just like the water cycle, methods release it, methods absorb it but there is currently too much co2 being generated for the cycle to cope with, so it is building up in the atmosphere and ocean.  and that source mysteriously appeared about the time of the industrial revolution, and mysteriously got worse with the wide spread use of cars, a total mystery i tell you.
10	1	0	your doomsday science is built on pandering for government grants by denying the science of non-human induced climate change.  you think that by throttling the worlds economy that global temperatures will stabilize, which you know is bunk.  the fact is that the climate is always changing, always has, always will.  this stasis that you think humans can create will fade away as it continues to be proven wrong.  all of the dire predictions have only been correct in one fashion: the climate continues to change but in that, nothing is different from historical data.
11	1	0	oh right, the old 'just in it for grants' nonsense. if scientists wanted money, they'd quit doing research and go work in a private industry job. nobody gets rich off doing research and its ridiculously long hours on top of that.  at no point have i proposed anywhere in this thread even a single solitary policy that anyone should enact with respect to climate change. not a word. not a whisper. not a single thing.  i've merely said and will say again, that yes, humans are causing the co2 levels to rise, and that rise is causing climate change, these are two facts which are supported by overwhelming evidence and there is not, in spite of what you just implied, some massive global conspiracy to trick you.
12	1	0	then just stop breathing
13	1	0	hum, it's just coincidence that earth's original climate was proven sub-tropical, it's just as coincidental that the natural state of earth's sub-tropical climate was disrupted by four ice age events.  ice sheets two miles thick, had an impact.  it is just as feasible that the warming of certain areas is a return to the "natural / original sub-tropical climate".  it's equally coincidental that the first "accepted" climate model was delivered in 1967, 55 years of often contested "science" against millions of years of change that the scientists and politicians are trying to control. yes, climate change is real but the scientists and politicians are not in control, and never will be.
14	1	0	gee and the ice core samples before the younger driest event had swing of 18 to 28 degree average means temperature on the planet after that it's been relatively stable with an oscillating temp between 2 degrees ...
15	1	0	co2 is a greenhouse gas because of this thing we call "physics", i know, physics is sort of a pain like that, what with your inability to do literally anything that lets you ignore it. the co2 levels were reasonably stable until the industrial age and then they began to increase rapidly. if it's not human activity, you're going to need to find a new source for it, because it's not natural activity either.
16	1	0	inuendo, speculation and falsely associating correlation with causation. because it is possible the reason co2 lingers longer in the atmosphere is because temperatures are higher as we go through the sun's cycles which we have been in a fairly longer and more intense than usual. second is that they only use data that agrees with the hypothesis and have eliminated those calculation that disprove the hypothesis... if everything is good and not cypherable by people they don't get grants. try this experiment created 2 plexiglass containers pressurize them equally 1 with co2 the other with natural air and monitor the temps... let me know the differences... then we can talk about manmade climate change...
17	1	0	oh look, another person who has no idea what they're talking about. this is not speculation. as we are able to tell the difference between sources such as volcanic activity and the decay of organic matter, and human activity. so yes, when we say that levels are rising due to human activity, that's something we can show to be true.  and yes you clown, we know co2 is a greenhouse gas both experimentally and due to physics. you remember physics right?  put simply, in deference to your education level on this subject, co2 acts like a greenhouse gas due to how it interacts with different wavelengths of radiation and it is reflecting some of the radiation back into the atmosphere, which is increasing the overall energy level, increased energy levels make things warmer.
18	1	0	no response to the sun's cycles and recent severity? i will ask you again to do your own experiment... you know science, repeatable science at that... let me know how that goes for you... other wise you are spouting things you don't really know just repeating what you are told... if it acts like a greenhouse gas does that mean it isn't a green house gas - it just wants to act like one for the moment. then there is that spouting education where i wonder where your level of education is because i am  looking forward to your explanation and not one regurgitated by more learned individuals.
19	1	0	clown, we have done the experiments, there have been thousand and thousands of experiments on this subject. you do not stand smugly biding your time like a great detective so you can swoop in and tell us something that "they never considered before!' yes clown, they have considered it before.  and i didn't need to go any further than i did because i already showed you don't even understand the topic on a basic college level, much less on the level of the people whom you think just "haven't considered!" this nonsense talking point of yours.
