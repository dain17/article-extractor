the other thing that is completely ignored by those who believe climate change is all man-made is the massive amount of co2 that is introduced to the atmosphere from volcanic activity. the tonga volcano spewed a whole year’s worth equivalent of man-made co2 just in one month last january.
vaporized water up into the upper atmosphere..which is causing the excessive heat waves and drought
and i have yet to see a humidity reading associated with the temperature readings.  you cannot calculate the real heat energy without both.
it wouldn't so up ..if the water was ejected..into upper atmosphere look up at the sky don't you see the strata clouds blanketing the upper sky ..you can see i especially at sunset ..
da
a contributing factor, but the problem is the co2.
that's the orthodox climate change answer but actually water vapor has more effect because there is so much more of it in the atmosphere than co2.  of course the climate crowd would be laughed out of town if they proposed limiting water vapor so their high priests have declared co2 as the source of the peoblem and anyone who doubts a heretic.
no, that's the answer that the science supports. there is no a human caused release of water vapor that the water cycle cannot keep up with causing water to build up in the atmosphere.  this is however a human cased release of co2 that is causing the carbon cycle to fall behind which is why co2 levels are rising. the people that would be laughed out of town are the people trying to use the water vapor talking point alright, and they'll be laughed at by people who understand how the science works :d
also have the increased tilt of the earth which weakens the magnetosphere.  that is a huge part of global warming, but tree huggers will never admit to that.  less than 1% of global warming is caused by humans.  can we do better?  yes, but we do not have to be so dramatic about it.
except you don't know what you're talking about, but science deniers rarely do.  volcanic activity and the decay of organic matter are the two major contributing factors for natural co2. we're completely and totally aware of this in climate science, and we take that into account.  the carbon cycle works just like the water cycle, methods release it, methods absorb it but there is currently too much co2 being generated for the cycle to cope with, so it is building up in the atmosphere and ocean.  and that source mysteriously appeared about the time of the industrial revolution, and mysteriously got worse with the wide spread use of cars, a total mystery i tell you.
your doomsday science is built on pandering for government grants by denying the science of non-human induced climate change.  you think that by throttling the worlds economy that global temperatures will stabilize, which you know is bunk.  the fact is that the climate is always changing, always has, always will.  this stasis that you think humans can create will fade away as it continues to be proven wrong.  all of the dire predictions have only been correct in one fashion: the climate continues to change but in that, nothing is different from historical data.
oh right, the old 'just in it for grants' nonsense. if scientists wanted money, they'd quit doing research and go work in a private industry job. nobody gets rich off doing research and its ridiculously long hours on top of that.  at no point have i proposed anywhere in this thread even a single solitary policy that anyone should enact with respect to climate change. not a word. not a whisper. not a single thing.  i've merely said and will say again, that yes, humans are causing the co2 levels to rise, and that rise is causing climate change, these are two facts which are supported by overwhelming evidence and there is not, in spite of what you just implied, some massive global conspiracy to trick you.
then just stop breathing
hum, it's just coincidence that earth's original climate was proven sub-tropical, it's just as coincidental that the natural state of earth's sub-tropical climate was disrupted by four ice age events.  ice sheets two miles thick, had an impact.  it is just as feasible that the warming of certain areas is a return to the "natural / original sub-tropical climate".  it's equally coincidental that the first "accepted" climate model was delivered in 1967, 55 years of often contested "science" against millions of years of change that the scientists and politicians are trying to control. yes, climate change is real but the scientists and politicians are not in control, and never will be.
gee and the ice core samples before the younger driest event had swing of 18 to 28 degree average means temperature on the planet after that it's been relatively stable with an oscillating temp between 2 degrees ...
co2 is a greenhouse gas because of this thing we call "physics", i know, physics is sort of a pain like that, what with your inability to do literally anything that lets you ignore it. the co2 levels were reasonably stable until the industrial age and then they began to increase rapidly. if it's not human activity, you're going to need to find a new source for it, because it's not natural activity either.
inuendo, speculation and falsely associating correlation with causation. because it is possible the reason co2 lingers longer in the atmosphere is because temperatures are higher as we go through the sun's cycles which we have been in a fairly longer and more intense than usual. second is that they only use data that agrees with the hypothesis and have eliminated those calculation that disprove the hypothesis... if everything is good and not cypherable by people they don't get grants. try this experiment created 2 plexiglass containers pressurize them equally 1 with co2 the other with natural air and monitor the temps... let me know the differences... then we can talk about manmade climate change...
oh look, another person who has no idea what they're talking about. this is not speculation. as we are able to tell the difference between sources such as volcanic activity and the decay of organic matter, and human activity. so yes, when we say that levels are rising due to human activity, that's something we can show to be true.  and yes you clown, we know co2 is a greenhouse gas both experimentally and due to physics. you remember physics right?  put simply, in deference to your education level on this subject, co2 acts like a greenhouse gas due to how it interacts with different wavelengths of radiation and it is reflecting some of the radiation back into the atmosphere, which is increasing the overall energy level, increased energy levels make things warmer.
no response to the sun's cycles and recent severity? i will ask you again to do your own experiment... you know science, repeatable science at that... let me know how that goes for you... other wise you are spouting things you don't really know just repeating what you are told... if it acts like a greenhouse gas does that mean it isn't a green house gas - it just wants to act like one for the moment. then there is that spouting education where i wonder where your level of education is because i am  looking forward to your explanation and not one regurgitated by more learned individuals.
clown, we have done the experiments, there have been thousand and thousands of experiments on this subject. you do not stand smugly biding your time like a great detective so you can swoop in and tell us something that "they never considered before!' yes clown, they have considered it before.  and i didn't need to go any further than i did because i already showed you don't even understand the topic on a basic college level, much less on the level of the people whom you think just "haven't considered!" this nonsense talking point of yours.
it does not go unnoticed that each of your responses are mostly filled with insults and statements that cannot be proven or dis-proven. which of course is what people do when they are uncertain of the information they are regurgitating..
there's not a single claim i've made about co2 that can't be checked by a hundred sources, knock yourself out.
quietsmith, talking down to people and belittling them will be ineffective and show you to be arrogant, which easily taints ones thinking. you may be right, but with a wrong attitude toward people, you will not win them over.
yes, 'i know better than the experts' isn't arrogant at all.
maybe it's actually womanmade.
why are you being sexist? i am not saying it isn't happening i am just saying that a change in the global amount of co2 - which equates to only .04% of the gases in our atmosphere raises temperatures to the degree that they say...
women are gassier.
co2 is plant food.
it is also a greenhouse gas and it is building up in our atmosphere :d
our atmosphere has undergone much larger changes all while supporting life. the plant food is creating a more lush planet - warmer and more verdant. it means more food can be grown to feed the hungry. you want a greener planet with less co2 emissions? go nuclear.
and forest fires have happened without humans and wild life survived too, therefore why should there be a problem with people starting a fire? it's no big deal right? in your limited understanding you think 'oh well, plants eat co2 therefore all good' so by your logic, you, who breathes oxygen, would be totally fine if we say... increased the oxygen level you breathe from normal atmospheric levels to extremely high levels, after all, its oxygen, its good for you right? right? that's totally how it works.  plants are conditioned to thrive in certain levels of heat, water, and atmospheric levels of gases, and you can't just throw stuff at them particularly in light of the extreme weather conditions including droughts and say 'oh its fine'.  and i'm totally fine with nuclear power, absolutely 100% fine with it. green energy cannot replace coal, but nuclear could.
“so, by your logic…” nope. that straw man ain’t gonna fly.
i see. you realized you had no counter point and just pretended what i said didn't work :d and no, strawman argument is not what i did.

our atmosphere has undergone much larger changes all while supporting life. the plant food is creating a more lush planet - warmer and more verdant. it means more food can be grown to feed the hungry. you want a greener planet with less co2 emissions? go nuclear.
and forest fires have happened without humans and wild life survived too, therefore why should there be a problem with people starting a fire? it's no big deal right? in your limited understanding you think 'oh well, plants eat co2 therefore all good' so by your logic, you, who breathes oxygen, would be totally fine if we say... increased the oxygen level you breathe from normal atmospheric levels to extremely high levels, after all, its oxygen, its good for you right? right? that's totally how it works.  plants are conditioned to thrive in certain levels of heat, water, and atmospheric levels of gases, and you can't just throw stuff at them particularly in light of the extreme weather conditions including droughts and say 'oh its fine'.  and i'm totally fine with nuclear power, absolutely 100% fine with it. green energy cannot replace coal, but nuclear could.

it does not go unnoticed that each of your responses are mostly filled 
with insults and statements that cannot be proven or dis-proven. which 
of course is what people do when they are uncertain of the information 
they are regurgitating..
the currently touted "too much" is an opinion and isn't that the real conundrum.  earth with and without man has had many cycles where the co2 build up exceeded the present and again dropped below "norms".  some survive the cycles and some don't but the fallacy is that we can control it. a northern hemisphere tundra thaw undoes in a day anything man can offset - that is scientific fact not opinion.
indeed, there have been co2 rises and falls in the past, which as physics will tell you, has resulted in global temperature changes, but sitting there going 'well it happened before therefore it can't be humans now' is absurd.  and we can control it, we're doing that now through our release of carbon emissions.
statistically speaking we haven't moved the needle as measured by any "science" that you might want to cite. one can claim credit for naturally occurring variances over time but in fact it doesn't outweigh the reality of the math underlying the physics.
basically doubling the co2 levels in 200 years is astronomically fast from a geological time scale. if normal speed were a bike, we're running at f1 car speeds.
my friend you just went off the rails of science into pseudo science as in lets develop a model to fit our narrative.  no amount of the us carbon emission control can offset the world at large or for that matter a single country burning their rainforest.
ha, you're the one sitting around saying that the people who have spent decades on this don't know what they're talking about :d and i never said anything about policy.  i said co2 levels are rising due to human activity, which they are. and that co2 is a greenhouse gas, which it is. which means temperatures are rising as a result of human activity.  at no point ever did i suggest any country enact any policy, that's a political thing, i'm only talking about the science.
you choose to ignore the statistics that do not support your hypothesis in relation to real time measurable effect that you claim is due to what mankind does or does not do in the scope of worldwide co2 emissions from all sources.
not only am i not the one 'ignoring things that don't support the argument', i keep having to show you that you are. that the co2 levels are rising due to human activity is not a "claim", it is a demonstrated reality based on an abundance of evidence, aside from it occurring within a timescale that is absolutely insane by geological scales and 'just so happens' to have been when humans started burning fossil fuels... i've got some shocking news for you.  we can chemically tell the difference between sources of co2, so we know these co2 emissions are from fossil fuels burning.  did you want to keep going on this? because one of us knows this topic and it's not you.

actually, the data simply does not support claims of significant anthropogenic climate impacts.  (computer models are not “evidence”.  indeed, a model that is valid must not only be predictive going forward, it should also be able to match actual weather and climate patterns when run in reverse, but this does not happen.). you say “we”.  we who?  there is no real consensus in anthropogenic climate claims, claims to the contrary notwithstanding.  neither has there actually been an increase in “extreme weather” events.  on the contrary.  finally, calling people “climate deniers” is simply a confession that climate change alarmists do not have a good case.  nobody denies climate and nobody denies that climate changes and always will.  what is at issue is whether and to what degree human activity contributes to it.  the best data undermines and claim that human activity is a significant factor.  you speak from ignorance.
data from multiple scientific disciplines make anthropogenic global warming perfectly obvious. it just takes a bit of reading.
the data absolutely supports the current understanding of  climate change and anyone who has told you otherwise has either lied to you or doesn't know what they're talking about. we don't just throw numbers in a computer and get a result. that's so ignorant of how this science works that it's completely laughable and the idea that there's "no consensus" is also completely laughable and once again, either you've been lied to or somebody doesn't know what they're talking about.  you could walk into any science department in any university on the globe or any scientific organization even remotely connected to climate science and they would tell you precise what i'm about to tell you. that co2 levels are rising due to human activity, and we know they are rising due to human activity, and we know that co2 is a greenhouse gas due to a property of physics.
no, the data don’t.  reflexively saying it does does not help you.  have you actually reviewed the data.  do you have a research background?  do you know how to critique research design and how to independently analyze the data and the manner in which it was analyzed?  if you do you wou know your claim is unfounded.
as opposed to just going "nuh uh!" without knowing what you're talking about the way you're doing, got it. :d  'research background'
i do actually! thank you for asking, not in climate science however.  your claims are nonsense as once again, physics is a thing and there is no way to make physics lie.
climate change....or what it was first called, "global warming", isn't a proved scientific fact like you try to argue.  we know that much of what the "scientists" have argued, predicted, ranted, and tried to out shout opposition, hasn't been accurate.  and if the evidence is sooooo much in your favor why did those "scientists" agree to refuse to publish studies and articles that questioned, or show contrary evidence, to this so called truth called climate change (remember climategate?).   i remember the ozone hole....and the predictions of the ice pack at the arctic being lost along with the polar bear...and so far the coasts of all the worlds countries haven't been flooded, drowning cities and causing tremendous population displacement.  trying to silence opposition by labeling and then marginalizing opposing views only proves the shallowness of your argument. and to say that if you walk into any science department at any university and find the same "physics" and climate beliefs means nothing. those same "schools" are now pedaling such trash as "micro-aggression" , safe places (except if you are a conservative), and more junk science.  you align yourself with aoc....who drives a tesla while whining about her student loan....and i wonder if she has finally figured out that you can't take the train to hawaii!
i respond to your facts and data with facts and data.
the tonga volcano spewed massive amounts of sea water into the stratosphere that will warm the earth for the next ten years. it increased the water content in the stratosphere by 10%. i also admit human contribution of carbon dioxide has warmed the planet, but i completely disagree with you when i say it's a good thing. 
i say human caused global warming is a good thing because without it, the earth would be colder than it was in the 19th century, which was the coldest on record. if you follow the trends for the last 20,000 years, you will see a clear rise in temperature that peaked 5000 years ago. from then on, we were slowly cooling until the industrial revolution began  burning coal in industrial quantities.
before this we had years without summer. this was triggered by a volcanic eruption combined with the low temperature of the earth. the ice age was actually beginning again. we call this period the mini ice age, but without human caused global warming, there would be nothing mini about it. mount pinatubo's eruption would have caused multiple years without summer. glaciers would be growing, people would be starving. animals would be going extinct.
one other thing. the recent warming was not a result of increased carbon dioxide, but rather in a massive decrease in sulfur dioxide.  we ended acid rain but stopped reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space,
so you agree human co2 emissions have warmed the planet, oh well you're off to a good start, but immediately go into side splitting nonsense that would have climate scientists laugh at you. from a geological timescale this increase in co2 is absolute insanity. in terms of speed if a bicycle were normal, this would be a race car, and under no circumstances is a change that rapid going to have a net end good result, the environment simply can't take it.  the 'year without summer' was in 1816? and caused by an extremely unusual event that did not persist, it was not a long term condition and while it could happen again, it will once again be a short term condition.  the problems we have from climate change will be non stop, more intense weather events, including both drought and flood, and even if we don't get that, the increased need for irrigation due to heat is going to be something else entirely and we're already facing down an irrigation problem as it is.
the year without summer was caused by a volcanic eruption in combination with a solar minimum and in combination with the steadily lowering temperatures as the earth was returning to another cold period. 
my point is this: global warming is indeed real, and it needs to be contained, but the fact is we would have a worse problem on our hands right now without it, so it really isn't the existential, immediate end of the world crisis that the extremists make it out to be.  look at the trends and realise that the 19th century was the coldest ever recorded and the 20th would have been colder without global warming.
another problem is that we who are discussing it have absolutely no say.  since the year 2000, the us has cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 20%.  the eu has cut theirs as well. that is huge, but what difference does it make when china more than tripled their output in the same time and is more than double our output?
ha, no, our problems would not 'be worse' without it. the climate remained stable for centuries and only began to get warmer when co2 emissions rose significantly.  and as for policy decisions? i don't get into them. i'm only talking about the science.
ha, no, our problems would not 'be worse' without it. the climate remained stable for centuries and only began to get warmer when co2 emissions rose significantly.  and as for policy decisions? i don't get into them. i'm only talking about the science.
none of the computer models to date have been able to predict next year's weather accurately, let alone the next fifty years. they are merely best guesses based on what we currently know and the more we learn about the atmosphere and climate the more we discover we don't know.
wow. you are a skilled writer of fiction, but science ain't your thing.
if you have something intelligent to say to counter my claims then please do so, otherwise get back to cleaning your mom's basement. adults are talking.
i don't waste my time on those who just make things up.
you are no adult.

just like you and your friends can predict exactly when volcanos erupt, major earthquakes will happen and when rouge waves will occur.
lip stick waves too i guess. but there's a reason we can't predict those things because the variables that control them too quick to respond to. it's like comparing hurricanes to tornadoes, you will get minutes for a tornado, you have days for a hurricane.
exactly. we can measure and we have theories based upon observations.  
climate theories are not fact. theories are not proven.  
many people simply do not believe people who have been preaching are proven wrong over and over. especially when politics get involved and they open their mouths.  
i responded to one of your other posts, citing widely variant co2 levels over time. and yes, it should sound familiar because it is based on observations and theories. 
science can not predict exactly when certain things can happen because there are way to many variables.
physics is as close to a fact as you're going to get however, and it's physics that ultimately tells us what happens when co2 levels rise. there's no escaping that reality, the math tells you what happens when co2 levels rise with just as much certainty as it tells you f = ma.  i've not said a word about the politics. i've merely stated that what the evidence supports to an overwhelming degree: co2 levels are rising due to human activity and co2 is a greenhouse gas.  and yes we can predict what co2 levels will do, again, physics, and we can see it too, as all of the warmest years on record have been since... 2010.  1996 was high and climate deniers tried for years to say that there had 'actually been a decline' because 96 was an outlier, but now 96 isn't even in the top 10. 2021 made the middle because of weather conditions that bumped it down slightly, but still, it made the list.  all of the warmest years since 2010? if only somebody had predicted this... oh wait, they did.

you may wish to work on your bedside manner, as you won't convince a single skeptic with that acerbic tone.  also, if you want to maintain the intellectual high-ground, you can't resort to post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacies like your final sentence and expect to maintain credibility.  example...  pizza did not exist before dinosaurs went extinct.  therefore, the invention of pizza caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.

it does not go unnoticed that you have no counter to anything i said and are just whining :d
and doesn't correlate at all with population growth, right?
to a degree, yes, but what it actually correlates to is co2 emission levels which is why it jumped and then jumped faster once car use became wide spread.

and i bet you have read the bible...........
sure, it's absolute nonsense at best and repugnant at worst.
blah...blah...blah
yes, just block out reality, i'm sure that'll make it go away :d
your doomsday science is built on pandering for government grants by denying the science of non-human induced climate change.  you think that by throttling the worlds economy that global temperatures will stabilize, which you know is bunk.  the fact is that the climate is always changing, always has, always will.  this stasis that you think humans can create will fade away as it continues to be proven wrong.  all of the dire predictions have only been correct in one fashion: the climate continues to change but in that, nothing is different from historical data.
oh right, the old 'just in it for grants' nonsense. if scientists wanted money, they'd quit doing research and go work in a private industry job. nobody gets rich off doing research and its ridiculously long hours on top of that.  at no point have i proposed anywhere in this thread even a single solitary policy that anyone should enact with respect to climate change. not a word. not a whisper. not a single thing.  i've merely said and will say again, that yes, humans are causing the co2 levels to rise, and that rise is causing climate change, these are two facts which are supported by overwhelming evidence and there is not, in spite of what you just implied, some massive global conspiracy to trick you.
then just stop breathing
then just stop breathing
hum, it's just coincidence that earth's original climate was proven sub-tropical, it's just as coincidental that the natural state of earth's sub-tropical climate was disrupted by four ice age events.  ice sheets two miles thick, had an impact.  it is just as feasible that the warming of certain areas is a return to the "natural / original sub-tropical climate".  it's equally coincidental that the first "accepted" climate model was delivered in 1967, 55 years of often contested "science" against millions of years of change that the scientists and politicians are trying to control. yes, climate change is real but the scientists and politicians are not in control, and never will be.
a single eruption that possibly (it was a chinese study you are quoting) added one years worth of co2 (maybe). on average hiwever all the volcanoes of the world only add what mankind does in a day
greenhouse gas emissions from volcanoes comprise less than one percent of those generated by today’s human endeavors.  (scientific american) the fossil fuels emissions numbers are about 100 times bigger than even the maximum estimated volcanic co2 fluxes.  (skeptical science)
other than uninformed politicians, who believes climate change is "all man-made"?
pretty much nobody. your straw-man argument does not work.
best estimates of the tonga were that it was only 2% above its usual emissions.
human-caused emissions of co2 are about 50 billion metric tons per year.
volcano totals around the world are a max of 360 million metric tons.
so your premise is completely wrong.
yes, but the volcano activity is the direct result of not enough sacrifices. 
given that hillary, bill, joe, nancy, jerry nadler, etc.. all have voiced strong opinions on climate change, i see no reason why they can't be at the front of that list. taking one for the team so to speak. apease the gods!
hey big, carbon monoxides from propane, coal, and oil pollute atmosphere.
just because the house is on fire doesn’t mean we should play with matches
vaporized water up into the upper atmosphere..which is causing the excessive heat waves and drought
and i have yet to see a humidity reading associated with the temperature readings.  you cannot calculate the real heat energy without both.
it wouldn't so up ..if the water was ejected..into upper atmosphere look up at the sky don't you see the strata clouds blanketing the upper sky ..you can see i especially at sunset ..

a contributing factor, but the problem is the co2.
that's the orthodox climate change answer but actually water vapor has more effect because there is so much more of it in the atmosphere than co2.  of course the climate crowd would be laughed out of town if they proposed limiting water vapor so their high priests have declared co2 as the source of the peoblem and anyone who doubts a heretic.
no, that's the answer that the science supports. there is no a human caused release of water vapor that the water cycle cannot keep up with causing water to build up in the atmosphere.  this is however a human cased release of co2 that is causing the carbon cycle to fall behind which is why co2 levels are rising. the people that would be laughed out of town are the people trying to use the water vapor talking point alright, and they'll be laughed at by people who understand how the science works :d

also have the increased tilt of the earth which weakens the magnetosphere.  that is a huge part of global warming, but tree huggers will never admit to that.  less than 1% of global warming is caused by humans.  can we do better?  yes, but we do not have to be so dramatic about it.
i love this stuff. a crater is a 'provable event". but so called 'climatologists' cannot explain with certainty what caused the 'little ice age' that lasted from 1300 to 1850 that cost millions of lives. but i am sure dicaprio and kerry can explain it even though there were -o- emissions from fossil fuels. look it up. there are climate cycles and 'wealth distribution' is not the result of these.
the little ice age was caused by the cooling effect of massive volcanic eruptions, and sustained by changes in arctic ice cover,
 scientists conclude. an international research team studied ancient 
plants from iceland and canada, and sediments carried by glaciers. well that took five seconds.
the largest cooling period is when we didn't have enough co2 the planet  got oxygen rich and dropped the temperature to cause the equator to freeze...no cars back then either
fascinating. the major driver of global temperatures on our planet are solar activity and co2 levels. always has been that way.
i'd say you don't even have half the story. you are hammering on a few points that are important but are framed in a much larger context of time and space. the sad part is that the few points are getting the political attention and the larger framework gets overlooked. they used to call that penny wise and pound foolish.

ps...copy/paste much?? find new sources. that has been disproven.
actually, the krakatoa eruption caused most of the cooling and is generally accepted as the cause by scientists. the rub is that it dumped more co2 into the atmosphere than man did for the proceeding thousand years. that co2 found in arctic ice layers is claimed by climate scientists to be evidence of human induced climate change although it predates large scale fossil fuel usage by a century. 
the little ice age ran from about 1300 to about 1850. krakatoa erupted in 1883.
you are correct, the second major eruption of krakatoa was in 1883 but the original was in 535 and caused global climate change for over a year. most climate scientists use this as the definitive model for climate disruption. the actual start of the little ice age was caused by mt samalas on lombok island and exacerbated by quilotoa in the andes, an unknown eruption on vanuatu, and mt tambora in sumbwana. together these spewed about 550 cubic kilometers of material into the atmosphere.

no one has ever satisfactorily explained what melted the ice during the last big ice age when the ice over nyc area was over a mile thick. i've googled it and there are 100's of explanations. now i'm not a scientist but in my opinion the ice melted when the earth's atmosphere warmed in which the warming was caused by fred and barney's feet driving their "cars."
amazing that signs of that glacier are still evident in the rocks in new york. the great lakes were formed from the melt and the ground is still rising 12,000 years later 
we do have a satisfactory answer, you just haven't heard what it is. :d and no there are not 'hundreds', there are several contributing factors.
please feel free to explain what melted the ice. i didn't say there were hundreds of reasons as to why the ice melted.  it was a figure of speech saying that there are "lots" of theories/explanation from a lot of so called "experts" as to why the ice melted but no one, it seems, can come to a full agreement as to these "contributing"factors. 
and that's mr :d to you.
you can google 'what caused the end of the last ice age' and learn all about it if you want. we have a perfectly good explanation for it :d
i did but there are several opposing theories...some say earth's tilt, some say other things but if you googled it you would see probably a dozen theories that are all different.
again, your myopic and narrowminded view based on your chosen "several" factors.
wow...are you related to cackles because you didn't say anything important. 
i am very open minded and i'm just waiting on someone to come out with a satisfactory logical explanation. nobody has one. they are all theories without proof.
if i wasn't open minded i would dislike people who make rude and crude comments without contributing something useful to the conversation.
i know opinions are opinions and we all have one but it seems you  are a larger opinion than most.
yes, evidence, reality, various other things you're unfamiliar with.
don’t forget fred’s dinosaur at the rock  quarry!
mammoth farts!
currently, it's cow farts according to aoc.
was caused by a super massive volcano possibly yellowstone. the “nuclear” winter effect lasted over a hundred years
maybe....maybe not. some theories suggest a slight tilt in the earth's axis along with sun activity caused both the ice age and the melting. but that's just one theory.
liberals were born and their hot air melted it is as good of an explanation "scientists" have
the dims say it was dino's farts

this happened, approximately, 66 million years ago!  and the climate change gods are trying to convince the world that human activity over the last 100 years is causing global destruction! 
it’s like covid!  it’s not about the science, it’s about the money! 
absolutely...even though i love this stuff, a crater is a 'provable event". but so called 'climatologists' cannot explain with certainty what caused the 'little ice age' that lasted from 1300 to 1850 that cost millions of lives. but i am sure dicaprio and kerry can explain it even though there were -o- emissions from fossil fuels. look it up. there are climate cycles and 'wealth distribution' is not the result of these.
yup, with regards to climate the only constant is change.
probably volcanic activity.
....these so called 'climatologists' cannot explain with certainty what caused the 'little ice age' that lasted from 1300 to 1850 that killed millions. but i am sure dicaprio and kerry can even though there were -o- emissions from fossil fuels. look it up.
nobody is saying climate change will cause global destruction. only that it will cause mass extinctions, famine, high food prices, recessions, mass migrations... if it was only the sea levels rising a few inches who would care?
indeed they are, and at great costs to taxpayers.
we have evidence that dinosaurs frequented gyms and took hormones. they found traces of a steroid near their remains
fossil fuel usage ended the last ice age.
tell me what one has to do with the other ?   here's a clue, gus..  a change in the climate due to unnatural circumstances can have catastrophic results.   get it ?
somehow pelosi survived.
well, that's because they've got their heads stuck up their asteroids.
dinosaur farts had consequences..that's why are beloved leaders are pushing us unwashed masses to eat bugs... cuts down on the cows and people's farts that way

accept that we are going through a period of global warming.  the problem with the activists, is that they assume it is all human caused.  that is problem number 1.  the 2nd is the only answer is to stop all human activity that puts carbon into the atmosphere. first, we should be smart enough to be able to figure out what percentage is natural and what percentage is man made.
second.  stop all the total elimination nonsense.  eliminating fossil fuel is and will cause tremendous problems throughout the world. it is already happening.
instead, invest in improving and scaling up the technology that allows the removal of carbon dioxide from the air and replaces it with oxygen.  this way you can still use fossil fuels for energy and mitigate their effects to zero on our atmosphere.  reducing the reliance on fossil fuels can still continue, but with a lot less zeal.
your commonsense approach does not the climate change minds
and massive climate change happened. without help from humans. the impact we humans have on the earth is miniscule. liberals are way over-inflated with their egos.
by your logic because fires can start naturally, people cannot start them, got it.
it's all about control, tell a lie big enough and long enough it becomes consensus, just ask the paycheck grabbing government "climate scientists" how it works. pigs never leave the food trough...
probably just a chunk that broke off of the asteroid that made the chicxulub crater.
in a related story, cdc "scientist" found traces of covid-19 in the crater...
we still have dinosaurs in congress, there dead but not extinct.
but can they spell "they're"?
it's simply amazing when you think about it. biden actually survived that calamity.
what are you talking about? he actually rode the asteroid to it's final destination!
yaaaaahooooo!
of course he did he was hiding in the basement.
so did nancy pelosi!
i thought she rode a broom.
mad max was there to see the whole thing!
he did it
yeah and he’s not joking. no joke man
unfortunate, isn't it....
yeah, but he was left brain dead.
what are you talking about? he actually rode the asteroid to it's final destination!
yaaaaahooooo!
